          "content": "Part I\nFor example, a significant deterioration in the credit\nquality of one of JPMorgan Chase’s borrowers or\ncounterparties could lead to concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of other borrowers or counterparties\nin similar, related or dependent industries. This type\nof interrelationship could exacerbate JPMorgan Chase’s\ncredit, liquidity and market risk exposure and\npotentially cause it to incur losses, including fair\nvalue losses in its market-making businesses and\ninvestment portfolios. In addition, JPMorgan Chase may\nbe required to recognize higher allowances for credit\nlosses with respect to certain clients or industries\nin order to align with directives or expectations of\nits banking regulators.\nSimilarly, challenging economic conditions that affect\na particular industry or geographic area could lead to\nconcerns about the credit quality of JPMorgan Chase’s\nborrowers or counterparties not only in that\nparticular industry or geography but in related or\ndependent industries, wherever located. These\nconditions could also heighten concerns about the\nability of customers of JPMorgan Chase’s consumer\nbusinesses who live in those areas or work in those\naffected industries or related or dependent industries\nto meet their obligations to JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan\nChase regularly monitors various segments of its\ncredit and market risk exposures to assess the\npotential risks of concentration or contagion, but its\nefforts to diversify or hedge its exposures against\nthose risks may not be successful.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can also be\nharmed by an excessive expansion of consumer credit by\nbank or non-bank competitors. Heightened competition\nfor certain types of consumer loans could prompt\nindustry-wide reactions such as significant reductions\nin the pricing or margins of those loans or the making\nof loans to less-creditworthy borrowers. If large\nnumbers of consumers subsequently default on their\nloans, whether due to weak credit profiles, an\neconomic downturn or other factors, this could impair\ntheir ability to repay obligations owed to JPMorgan\nChase and result in higher charge-offs and other\ncredit-related losses. More broadly, widespread\ndefaults on consumer debt could lead to recessionary\nconditions in the U.S. economy, and JPMorgan Chase’s\nconsumer businesses may earn lower revenues in such an\nenvironment.\nIf JPMorgan Chase is unable to reduce positions\neffectively during a market dislocation, this can\nincrease both the market and credit risks associated\nwith those positions and the level of RWA that\nJPMorgan Chase holds on its balance sheet. These\nfactors could adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s\ncapital position, funding costs and the profitability\nof its businesses.\nLiquidity\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses\ncould be impaired if its liquidity is constrained.\nJPMorgan Chase’s liquidity could be impaired at any\ngiven time by factors such as:\nmarket-wide illiquidity or disruption\nunforeseen liquidity or capital requirements,\nincluding as a result of changes in laws, rules and\nregulations\ninability to sell assets, or to sell assets at\nfavorable times or prices\ndefault by a CCP or other significant market\nparticipant\nunanticipated outflows of cash or collateral\nunexpected loss of consumer deposits, and\nlack of market or customer confidence in JPMorgan\nChase or financial institutions in general.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity may be\ncaused by events over which it has little or no\ncontrol. For example, during periods of market stress,\nlow investor confidence and significant market\nilliquidity could result in higher funding costs for\nJPMorgan Chase and could limit its access to some of\nits traditional sources of liquidity.\nJPMorgan Chase may need to raise funding from\nalternative sources if its access to stable and lower-\ncost sources of funding, such as deposits and\nborrowings from Federal Home Loan Banks, is reduced.\nAlternative sources of funding could be more expensive\nor limited in availability. JPMorgan Chase’s funding\ncosts could also be negatively affected by actions\nthat JPMorgan Chase may take in order to:\nsatisfy applicable liquidity coverage ratio and net\nstable funding ratio requirements\naddress obligations under its resolution plan, or\nsatisfy regulatory requirements in jurisdictions\noutside the U.S. relating to the pre-positioning of\nliquidity in subsidiaries that are material legal\nentities.\nMore generally, if JPMorgan Chase fails to effectively\nmanage its liquidity, this could constrain its ability\nto fund or invest in its businesses and subsidiaries\n(including, in particular, its broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries), and thereby adversely affect its\nresults of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company and depends\non the cash flows of its subsidiaries to make payments\non its outstanding securities.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. is a holding company that holds\nthe stock of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and an\nintermediate holding company, JPMorgan Chase Holdings\nLLC (the “IHC”). The IHC in turn holds the stock of\nsubstantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries\nother than JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nsubsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes\nintercompany indebtedness to the holding company.\nThe holding company is obligated to contribute to the\nIHC substantially all the net proceeds received from\nsecurities issuances (including issuances of senior\nand subordinated debt securities and of preferred and\ncommon stock).\nThe ability of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the IHC\nto make payments to the holding company is also\nlimited. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject to\nrestrictions\n18\non its dividend distributions, as well as capital\nadequacy requirements, such as the Supplementary\nLeverage Ratio (“SLR”), and liquidity requirements and\nother regulatory restrictions on its ability to make\npayments to the holding company. The IHC is prohibited\nfrom paying dividends or extending credit to the\nholding company if certain capital or liquidity\nthresholds are breached or if limits are otherwise\nimposed by JPMorgan Chase’s management or Board of\nDirectors.\nAs a result of these arrangements, the ability of the\nholding company to make various payments is dependent\non its receiving dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the\nIHC. These limitations could affect the holding\ncompany’s ability to:\npay interest on its debt securities\npay dividends on its equity securities\nredeem or repurchase outstanding securities, and\nfulfill its other payment obligations.\nThese regulatory restrictions and limitations could\nalso result in the holding company seeking protection\nunder bankruptcy laws at a time earlier than would\nhave been the case absent the existence of the capital\nand liquidity thresholds to which the IHC is subject.\nReductions in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings may\nadversely affect its liquidity and cost of funding.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain of its principal\nsubsidiaries are rated by credit rating agencies.\nRating agencies evaluate both general and firm-\nspecific and industry-specific factors when\ndetermining credit ratings for a particular financial\ninstitution, including:\nexpected future profitability\nrisk management practices\nlegal expenses\nratings differentials between bank holding companies\nand their bank and non-bank subsidiaries\nregulatory developments\nassumptions about government support, and\neconomic and geopolitical trends.\nJPMorgan Chase closely monitors and manages, to the\nextent that it is able, factors that could influence\nits credit ratings. However, there is no assurance\nthat JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings will not be\nlowered in the future. Furthermore, any such downgrade\ncould occur at times of broader market instability\nwhen JPMorgan Chase’s options for responding to events\nmay be more limited and general investor confidence is\nlow.\nA reduction in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings could\ncurtail JPMorgan Chase’s business activities and\nreduce its profitability in a number of ways,\nincluding:\nreducing its access to capital markets\nmaterially increasing its cost of issuing and\nservicing securities\ntriggering additional collateral or funding\nrequirements, and\ndecreasing the number of investors and\ncounterparties that are willing or permitted to do\nbusiness with or lend to JPMorgan Chase.\nAny rating reduction could also increase the credit\nspreads charged by the market for taking credit risk\non JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries. This\ncould, in turn, adversely affect the value of debt and\nother obligations of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its\nsubsidiaries.\nThe reform and replacement of benchmark rates could\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s funding, investments\nand financial products, and expose it to litigation\nand other disputes.\nInterest rate, equity, foreign exchange rate and other\ntypes of indices which are deemed to be “benchmarks,”\nincluding those in widespread and longstanding use,\nhave been the subject of ongoing international,\nnational and other regulatory scrutiny and initiatives\nand proposals for reform. Some of these reforms are\nalready effective while others are still to be\nimplemented or are under consideration. These reforms\nmay cause certain benchmarks to perform differently\nthan in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have\nother consequences which cannot be fully anticipated.\nAny of the benchmark reforms which have been proposed\nor implemented, or the general increased regulatory\nscrutiny of benchmarks, could also increase the costs\nand risks of administering or otherwise participating\nin the setting of benchmarks and complying with\nregulations or requirements relating to benchmarks.\nSuch factors may have the effect of discouraging\nmarket participants from continuing to administer or\ncontribute to certain benchmarks, trigger changes in\nthe rules or methodologies used in certain benchmarks\nor lead to the disappearance of certain benchmarks.\nAny of these developments, and any future initiatives\nto regulate, reform or change the administration of\nbenchmarks, could result in adverse consequences to\nthe return on, value of and market for loans,\nmortgages, securities, derivatives and other financial\ninstruments whose returns are linked to any such\nbenchmark, including those issued, funded, serviced or\nheld by JPMorgan Chase.\nVarious regulators, industry bodies and other market\nparticipants in the U.S. and other countries are\nengaged in initiatives to develop, introduce and\nencourage the use of alternative rates to replace\ncertain benchmarks. There is no assurance that these\nnew rates will be accepted or widely used by market\nparticipants, or that the characteristics of any of\nthese new rates will be similar to, or produce the\neconomic equivalent of, the benchmarks that they seek\nto replace. If a particular benchmark were to be\ndiscontinued and an alternative rate has not been\nsuccessfully introduced to replace that benchmark,\nthis could result in widespread\n19",

Vast amounts of loans, mortgages, securities,\nderivatives and other financial instruments are linked\nto the LIBOR benchmark, and any inability of market\nparticipants and regulators to successfully introduce\nbenchmark rates to replace LIBOR and implement\neffective transitional arrangements to address the\ndiscontinuation of LIBOR could result in disruption in\nthe financial markets and suppress capital markets\nactivities, all of which could have a negative impact\non JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and on\nLIBOR-linked securities, credit or other instruments\nwhich are issued, funded, serviced or held by JPMorgan\nChase.\nJPMorgan Chase could also become involved in\nlitigation and other types of disputes with clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and investors as a\nconsequence of the transition from LIBOR and other\nbenchmark rates to replacement rates, including claims\nthat JPMorgan Chase has:\ntreated clients, customers, counterparties or\ninvestors unfairly, or caused them to experience\nlosses, higher financing costs or lower returns on\ninvestments\nfailed to appropriately communicate the effects of\nthe transition from benchmark rates on the products\nthat JPMorgan Chase has sold to its clients and\ncustomers, or failed to disclose purported conflicts\nof interest\nmade inappropriate product recommendations to or\ninvestments on behalf of its clients, or sold products\nthat did not serve their intended purpose, in\nconnection with the transition from benchmark rates\nengaged in anti-competitive behavior, or in the\nmanipulation of markets or specific benchmarks, in\nconnection with the discontinuation of or transition\nfrom benchmark rates, or\ndisadvantaged clients, customers, counterparties or\ninvestors when interpreting or making determinations\nunder the terms of agreements or financial\ninstruments.\nThese types of claims could subject JPMorgan Chase to\nhigher legal expenses and operational costs, require\nit to pay significant amounts in connection with\nresolving litigation and other disputes, and harm its\nreputation.\nCapital\nMaintaining the required level and composition of\ncapital may impact JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support\nbusiness activities, meet evolving regulatory\nrequirements and distribute capital to shareholders.\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to various regulatory\ncapital requirements, including leverage- and risk-\nbased capital requirements, that can change due to\nactions by banking regulators. JPMorgan Chase’s\nadherence to these requirements can also evolve\ndynamically in response to changes in the composition\nof its balance sheet or other factors. It is possible\nthat these changing requirements, including meeting or\nexceeding various capital ratio thresholds, could\nlimit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to support its\nbusinesses and make capital distributions to its\nshareholders.\nActions by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government\nin response to the economic effects of the COVID-19\npandemic have led to an expansion of the Federal\nReserve's balance sheet, growth in deposit balances\nheld by JPMorgan Chase and other U.S. financial\ninstitutions and, consequently, an increase in\nJPMorgan Chase's leverage exposure. If these trends\nwere to continue, JPMorgan Chase may be required to\nhold more capital or take other actions in order to\nsatisfy the leverage-based capital requirements\napplicable to it.\nJPMorgan Chase is required to submit, at least\nannually, a capital plan describing proposed dividend\npayments to shareholders, redemptions and repurchases\nof its outstanding securities and other capital\nactions that it intends to take. JPMorgan Chase\nconsiders various factors in managing capital,\nincluding the impact of stress on its capital levels,\nas determined by both internal modeling and the\nFederal Reserve’s modeling of JPMorgan Chase’s capital\nposition in supervisory stress tests. Because the\nFederal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase use different\nforecasting models and methodologies when determining\nstress test results, there can be significant\ndifferences between the estimates of stress loss as\ndetermined by the Federal Reserve and JPMorgan Chase,\nrespectively. The Federal\n20\nReserve may require modifications to JPMorgan Chase’s\ncapital plan, and may change the Stress Capital Buffer\n(“SCB”) applicable to JPMorgan Chase, from time to\ntime.\nAny failure by or inability of JPMorgan Chase to\nmaintain the required level and composition of\ncapital, or unfavorable changes in the capital\nrequirements imposed by banking regulators, could have\nan adverse impact on JPMorgan Chase’s shareholders,\nsuch as:\nreducing the amount of common stock that JPMorgan\nChase is permitted to repurchase\nrequiring the issuance of, or prohibiting the\nredemption of, capital instruments in a manner\ninconsistent with JPMorgan Chase’s capital management\nstrategy\nconstraining the amount of dividends that may be\npaid on common stock, or\ncurtailing JPMorgan Chase’s business activities or\noperations.\nOperational\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are dependent on the\neffectiveness of its operational systems and those of\nother market participants.\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses rely on the ability of\nJPMorgan Chase’s financial, accounting, transaction\nexecution, data processing and other operational\nsystems to process, record, monitor and report a large\nnumber of transactions on a continuous basis, and to\ndo so accurately, quickly and securely. In addition to\nproper design, installation, maintenance and training,\nthe effective functioning of JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational systems depends on:\nthe quality of the information contained in those\nsystems, as inaccurate, outdated or corrupted data can\nsignificantly compromise the functionality or\nreliability of a particular system and other systems\nto which it transmits or from which it receives\ninformation, and\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to appropriately maintain\nand upgrade its systems on a regular basis, and to\nensure that any changes introduced to its systems are\nmanaged carefully to ensure security and operational\ncontinuity and adhere to all applicable legal and\nregulatory requirements.\nJPMorgan Chase also depends on its ability to access\nand use the operational systems of its vendors,\ncustodians and other market participants, including\nclearing and payment systems, CCPs, securities\nexchanges and data processing, security and technology\ncompanies.\nThe ineffectiveness, failure or other disruption of\noperational systems upon which JPMorgan Chase depends,\nincluding due to a systems malfunction, cyberbreach or\nother systems failure, could result in unfavorable\nripple effects in the financial markets and for\nJPMorgan Chase and its clients and customers,\nincluding:\ndelays or other disruptions in providing\ninformation, services and liquidity to clients and\ncustomers\nthe inability to settle transactions or obtain\naccess to funds and other assets, including those for\nwhich physical settlement and delivery is required\nfailure to timely settle or confirm transactions\nthe possibility that funds transfers, capital\nmarkets trades or other transactions are executed\nerroneously, as a result of illegal conduct or with\nunintended consequences\nfinancial losses, including due to loss-sharing\nrequirements of CCPs, payment systems or other market\ninfrastructures, or as possible restitution to clients\nand customers\nhigher operational costs associated with replacing\nservices provided by a system that is unavailable\nclient or customer dissatisfaction with JPMorgan\nChase’s products and services\nregulatory fines, penalties, or other sanctions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase\nloss of confidence in the ability of JPMorgan Chase,\nor financial institutions generally, to protect\nagainst and withstand operational disruptions, or\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nAs the speed, frequency, volume, interconnectivity and\ncomplexity of transactions continue to increase, it\ncan become more challenging to effectively maintain\nand upgrade JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems and\ninfrastructure, especially due to the heightened risks\nthat:\nattempts by third parties to defraud JPMorgan Chase\nor its clients and customers may increase, evolve or\nbecome more complex, particularly during periods of\nmarket disruption or economic uncertainty\nerrors made by JPMorgan Chase or another market\nparticipant, whether inadvertent or malicious, cause\nwidespread system disruption\nisolated or seemingly insignificant errors in\noperational systems compound, or migrate to other\nsystems over time, to become larger issues\nfailures in synchronization or encryption software,\nor degraded performance of microprocessors due to\ndesign flaws, could cause disruptions in operational\nsystems, or the inability of systems to communicate\nwith each other, and\nthird parties may attempt to block the use of key\ntechnology solutions by claiming that the use\ninfringes on their intellectual property rights.\nIf JPMorgan Chase’s operational systems, or those of\nexternal parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s businesses\ndepend, are unable to meet the requirements of\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations or bank\nregulatory\n21",

These cyber attacks can take many forms,\nincluding attempts to introduce computer viruses or\nmalicious code, which is commonly referred to as\n“malware,” into JPMorgan Chase’s systems. These\nattacks are typically designed to:\nobtain unauthorized access to confidential\ninformation belonging to JPMorgan Chase or its\nclients, customers, counterparties or employees\nmanipulate data\ndestroy data or systems with the aim of rendering\nservices unavailable\ndisrupt, sabotage or degrade service on JPMorgan\nChase’s systems\nsteal money, or\nextort money through the use of so-called\n“ransomware.”\nJPMorgan Chase has also experienced significant\ndistributed denial-of-service attacks which are\nintended to disrupt online banking services.\nJPMorgan Chase has experienced security breaches due\nto cyber attacks in the past, and it is inevitable\nthat additional breaches will occur in the future. Any\nsuch breach could result in serious and harmful\nconsequences for JPMorgan Chase or its clients and\ncustomers.\nA principal reason that JPMorgan Chase cannot provide\nabsolute security against cyber attacks is that it may\nnot always be possible to anticipate, detect or\nrecognize threats to JPMorgan Chase’s systems, or to\nimplement effective preventive measures against all\nbreaches. This is because:\nthe techniques used in cyber attacks change\nfrequently and are increasingly sophisticated, and\ntherefore may not be recognized until launched\ncyber attacks can originate from a wide variety of\nsources, including JPMorgan Chase’s own employees,\ncyber-criminals, hacktivists, groups linked to\nterrorist organizations or hostile countries, or third\nparties whose objective is to disrupt the operations\nof financial institutions more generally\nJPMorgan Chase does not have control over the\ncybersecurity of the systems of the large number of\nclients, customers, counterparties and third-party\nservice providers with which it does business, and\nit is possible that a third party, after\nestablishing a foothold on an internal network without\nbeing detected, might obtain access to other networks\nand systems.\nThe risk of a security breach due to a cyber attack\ncould increase in the future as JPMorgan Chase\ncontinues to expand its mobile banking and other\ninternet-based product offerings and its internal use\nof internet-based products and applications.\nFurthermore, increased use of remote access and third\nparty video conferencing solutions during the COVID-19\npandemic, to facilitate work-from-home arrangements\nfor employees, could increase JPMorgan Chase’s\nexposure to cyber attacks. In addition, a third party\ncould misappropriate confidential information obtained\nby intercepting signals or communications from mobile\ndevices used by JPMorgan Chase’s employees.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the\nsecurity of JPMorgan Chase’s systems or the systems of\na vendor, governmental body or another market\nparticipant could cause serious negative consequences,\nincluding:\nsignificant disruption of JPMorgan Chase’s\noperations and those of its clients, customers and\ncounterparties, including losing access to operational\nsystems\nmisappropriation of confidential information of\nJPMorgan Chase or that of its clients, customers,\ncounterparties, employees or regulators\ndisruption of or damage to JPMorgan Chase’s systems\nand those of its clients, customers and counterparties\nthe inability, or extended delays in the ability, to\nfully recover and restore data that has been stolen,\nmanipulated or destroyed, or the inability to prevent\nsystems from processing fraudulent transactions\nviolations by JPMorgan Chase of applicable privacy\nand other laws\nfinancial loss to JPMorgan Chase or to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties or employees\nloss of confidence in JPMorgan Chase’s cybersecurity\nand business resiliency measures\ndissatisfaction among JPMorgan Chase’s clients,\ncustomers or counterparties\nsignificant exposure to litigation and regulatory\nfines, penalties or other sanctions, and\nharm to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nThe extent of a particular cyber attack and the steps\nthat JPMorgan Chase may need to take to investigate\nthe attack may not be immediately clear, and it may\ntake a significant amount of time before such an\ninvestigation can be completed. While such an\ninvestigation is ongoing, JPMorgan Chase may not\nnecessarily know the full extent of the harm caused by\nthe cyber attack, and that damage may\n22\ncontinue to spread. These factors may inhibit JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to provide rapid, full and reliable\ninformation about the cyber attack to its clients,\ncustomers, counterparties and regulators, as well as\nthe public. Furthermore, it may not be clear how best\nto contain and remediate the harm caused by the cyber\nattack, and certain errors or actions could be\nrepeated or compounded before they are discovered and\nremediated. Any or all of these factors could further\nincrease the costs and consequences of a cyber attack.\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected if it fails\nto identify and address operational risks associated\nwith the introduction of or changes to products,\nservices and delivery platforms.\nWhen JPMorgan Chase launches a new product or service,\nintroduces a new platform for the delivery or\ndistribution of products or services (including mobile\nconnectivity, electronic trading and cloud computing),\nor makes changes to an existing product, service or\ndelivery platform, it may not fully appreciate or\nidentify new operational risks that may arise from\nthose changes, or may fail to implement adequate\ncontrols to mitigate the risks associated with those\nchanges. Any significant failure in this regard could\ndiminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate one or\nmore of its businesses or result in:\npotential liability to clients, counterparties and\ncustomers\nincreased operating expenses\nhigher litigation costs, including regulatory fines,\npenalties and other sanctions\ndamage to JPMorgan Chase’s reputation\nimpairment of JPMorgan Chase’s liquidity\nregulatory intervention, or\nweaker competitive standing.\nAny of the foregoing consequences could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\nresults of operations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operational costs and customer\nsatisfaction could be adversely affected by the\nfailure of an external operational system.\nExternal operational systems with which JPMorgan is\nconnected, whether directly or indirectly, can be\nsources of operational risk to JPMorgan Chase.\nJPMorgan Chase may be exposed not only to a systems\nfailure or cyber attack that may be experienced by a\nvendor or market infrastructure with which JPMorgan\nChase is directly connected, but also to a systems\nbreakdown or cyber attack involving another party to\nwhich such a vendor or infrastructure is connected.\nSimilarly, retailers, data aggregators and other\nexternal parties with which JPMorgan Chase’s customers\ndo business can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational\nrisk. This is particularly the case where activities\nof customers or those parties are\nbeyond JPMorgan Chase’s security and control systems,\nincluding through the use of the internet, cloud\ncomputing services and personal smart phones and other\nmobile devices or services.\nIf an external party obtains access to customer\naccount data on JPMorgan Chase’s systems, and that\nparty experiences a cyberbreach of its own systems or\nmisappropriates that data, this could result in a\nvariety of negative outcomes for JPMorgan Chase and\nits clients and customers, including:\nheightened risk that external parties will be able\nto execute fraudulent transactions using JPMorgan\nChase’s systems\nlosses from fraudulent transactions, as well as\npotential liability for losses that exceed thresholds\nestablished in consumer protection laws, rules and\nregulations\nincreased operational costs to remediate the\nconsequences of the external party’s security breach,\nand\nharm to reputation arising from the perception that\nJPMorgan Chase’s systems may not be secure.\nAs JPMorgan Chase’s interconnectivity with clients,\ncustomers and other external parties continues to\nexpand, JPMorgan Chase increasingly faces the risk of\noperational failure or cyber attacks with respect to\nthe systems of those parties. Security breaches\naffecting JPMorgan Chase’s clients or customers, or\nsystems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or\nhuman error or misconduct affecting other external\nparties, may require JPMorgan Chase to take steps to\nprotect the integrity of its own operational systems\nor to safeguard confidential information, including\nrestricting the access of customers to their accounts.\nThese actions can increase JPMorgan Chase’s\noperational costs and potentially diminish customer\nsatisfaction and confidence in JPMorgan Chase.\nFurthermore, the widespread and expanding\ninterconnectivity among financial institutions,\ncentral agents, CCPs, payment processors, securities\nexchanges, clearing houses and other financial market\ninfrastructures increases the risk that an operational\nfailure or cyber attack involving one institution or\nentity may cause industry-wide operational disruptions\nthat could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability\nto conduct business.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations could be impaired if its\nemployees, or those of external parties, are not\ncompetent and trustworthy, or if measures to protect\ntheir health and safety are ineffective.\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to operate its businesses\nefficiently and profitably, to offer products and\nservices that meet the expectations of its clients and\ncustomers, and to maintain an effective risk\nmanagement framework is highly dependent on the\ncompetence and integrity of its employees, as well as\nemployees of other parties on which JPMorgan Chase’s\noperations rely, including vendors, custodians and\nfinancial markets infrastructures.

JPMorgan Chase could be exposed\nto litigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions if personal, confidential or proprietary\ninformation of clients, customers, employees or others\nwere to be mishandled or misused, such as situations\nwhere such information is:\nerroneously provided to parties who are not\npermitted to have the information, or\nintercepted or otherwise compromised by third\nparties.\nConcerns regarding the effectiveness of JPMorgan\nChase’s measures to safeguard personal information, or\neven the perception that those measures are\ninadequate, could cause JPMorgan Chase to lose\nexisting or potential clients and customers, and\nthereby reduce JPMorgan Chase’s revenues. Furthermore,\nany failure or perceived failure by JPMorgan Chase to\ncomply with applicable privacy or data protection\nlaws, rules and regulations may subject it to\ninquiries, examinations and investigations that could\nresult in requirements to modify or cease certain\noperations or practices, significant liabilities or\nregulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions. Any of\nthese could damage JPMorgan Chase’s reputation and\notherwise adversely affect its businesses.\nIn recent years, well-publicized allegations involving\nthe misuse or inappropriate sharing of personal\ninformation have led to expanded governmental scrutiny\nof practices relating to the safeguarding of personal\ninformation and the use or sharing of personal data by\ncompanies in the U.S. and other countries. That\nscrutiny has in some cases resulted in, and could in\nthe future lead to, the adoption of stricter laws,\nrules and regulations relating to the use and sharing\nof personal information. These types of laws and\nregulations could prohibit or significantly restrict\nfinancial services firms such as JPMorgan Chase from\nsharing information among affiliates or with third\nparties such as vendors, and thereby increase\ncompliance costs, or could restrict JPMorgan Chase’s\nuse of personal data when developing or offering\nproducts or services to customers.

There can be no assurance that\nJPMorgan Chase’s resiliency plans will fully mitigate\nall potential business continuity risks to JPMorgan\nChase or its clients and customers or that its\nresiliency plans will be adequate to address the\neffects of simultaneous occurrences of multiple\ncatastrophes or other business interruption events. In\naddition, JPMorgan Chase’s ability to respond\neffectively to a business interruption could be\nhampered to the extent that the members of its\nworkforce, physical assets or systems and other\nsupport infrastructure needed to address the event are\ngeographically dispersed, or conversely, if a\ncatastrophic event occurs in an area in which a\ncritical segment of JPMorgan Chase’s workforce,\nphysical assets or systems and other support\ninfrastructure is concentrated.

          "content": "Part I\nJPMorgan Chase’s data gathering, analysis and\nvalidation processes could result in ineffective risk\nmanagement practices. These deficiencies could also\nresult in inaccurate risk reporting.\nMany of JPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies\nand techniques consider historical market behavior.\nThese strategies and techniques are based to some\ndegree on management’s subjective judgment. For\nexample, many models used by JPMorgan Chase are based\non assumptions regarding historical correlations among\nprices of various asset classes or other market\nindicators. In times of market stress, including\ndifficult or less liquid market environments, or in\nthe event of other unforeseen circumstances,\npreviously uncorrelated indicators may become\ncorrelated. Conversely, previously-correlated\nindicators may make unrelated movements at those\ntimes. Sudden market movements and unanticipated or\nunidentified market or economic movements could, in\nsome circumstances, limit the effectiveness of\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk management strategies, causing\nit to incur losses.\nJPMorgan Chase could recognize unexpected losses, its\ncapital levels could be reduced and it could face\ngreater regulatory scrutiny if its models, estimations\nor judgments, including those used in its financial\nstatements, prove to be inadequate or incorrect.\nJPMorgan Chase has developed and uses a variety of\nmodels and other analytical and judgment-based\nestimations to measure, monitor and implement controls\nover its market, credit, capital, liquidity,\noperational and other risks. These models and\nestimations are based on a variety of assumptions and\nhistorical trends, and are periodically reviewed and\nmodified as necessary. The models and estimations that\nJPMorgan Chase uses may not be effective in all cases\nto identify, observe and mitigate risk due to a\nvariety of factors, such as:\nreliance on historical trends that may not\naccurately predict future events, including\nassumptions underlying the models and estimations\nwhich predict correlation among certain market\nindicators or asset prices\ninherent limitations associated with forecasting\nuncertain economic and financial outcomes\nhistorical trend information may be incomplete, or\nmay not anticipate severely negative market conditions\nsuch as extreme volatility, dislocation or lack of\nliquidity\ntechnology that is introduced to run models or\nestimations may not perform as expected, or may not be\nwell understood by the personnel using the technology\nmodels and estimations may contain erroneous data,\nvaluations, formulas or algorithms, and\nreview processes may fail to detect flaws in models\nand estimations.\nSome of the models and other analytical and judgment-\nbased estimations used by JPMorgan Chase in managing\nrisks are subject to review by, and require the\napproval of, JPMorgan Chase’s regulators. These\nreviews are required before JPMorgan Chase may use\nthose models and estimations in connection with\ncalculating market risk RWA, credit risk RWA and\noperational risk RWA under Basel III. If JPMorgan\nChase’s models or estimations are not approved by its\nregulators, it may be subject to higher capital\ncharges, which could adversely affect its financial\nresults or limit the ability to expand its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase also uses internal models in connection\nwith its stress testing. JPMorgan Chase’s capital\nactions may require regulatory approval and could be\nconstrained if its banking regulators object to a\ncapital plan or require the resubmission of a capital\nplan due to the perceived inadequacy of JPMorgan\nChase’s models, estimations or other factors.\nUnder U.S. generally accepted accounting principles\n(“U.S. GAAP”), JPMorgan Chase is required to use\nestimates and apply judgments in preparing its\nfinancial statements, including in determining the\nallowance for credit losses, reserves related to\nlitigation and the credit card rewards liability.\nCertain financial instruments require a determination\nof their fair value in order to prepare JPMorgan\nChase’s financial statements, including:\ntrading assets and liabilities\ninstruments in the investment portfolio\ncertain loans\nMSRs\nstructured notes, and\ncertain repurchase and resale agreements.\nWhere quoted market prices are not available for these\ntypes of financial instruments, JPMorgan Chase may\nmake fair value determinations based on internally\ndeveloped models or other means which ultimately rely\nto some degree on management estimates and judgment,\nand these types of estimates and judgments may not\nprove to be accurate due to a variety of factors, as\nnoted above. In addition, sudden illiquidity in\nmarkets or declines in prices of certain loans and\nsecurities may make it more difficult to value certain\nfinancial instruments, which could lead to valuations\nbeing subsequently changed or adjusted. If estimates\nor judgments underlying JPMorgan Chase’s financial\nstatements prove to have been incorrect, JPMorgan\nChase may experience material losses.\nJPMorgan Chase establishes an allowance for expected\ncredit losses that are inherent in its credit\nexposures. It then employs stress testing and other\ntechniques to determine the amounts of capital and\nliquidity that would be needed in the event of adverse\neconomic or market events. These processes are\ncritical to JPMorgan Chase’s results of operations and\nfinancial condition. They require difficult,\nsubjective and complex judgments, including forecasts\nof how economic conditions might impair the ability of\nJPMorgan Chase’s borrowers and counterparties to repay\ntheir loans or other obligations. It is possible that\n26\nJPMorgan Chase will fail to identify the proper\nfactors or that it will fail to accurately estimate\nthe impact of factors that it identifies.\nCertain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection\nwith the determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses have heightened performance risk in the\neconomic environment precipitated by the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. For\nexample, at times certain macroeconomic variables\nemployed in these models remained well outside the\nrange of historical data used to train the models for\nsome stress scenarios. In addition, the historical\nrelationships between these macroeconomic variables\nand consumer and wholesale credit losses have\ndeteriorated, in part due to the effects of the CARES\nAct and government stimulus actions. As a result,\nthere continues to be significant uncertainty about\nthe reliability of the projections produced by the\nmodels. To compensate for this uncertainty, JPMorgan\nChase has made, and may continue to make, significant\nadjustments to the quantitative results of model\ncalculations to take into consideration model\nimprecision, emerging risks, trends and other factors\nthat are not yet reflected in those calculations.\nThere can be no assurance that, even after adjustments\nhave been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will\nnot recognize unexpected losses arising from the model\nuncertainty that has resulted from these developments.\nLapses in controls over disclosure or financial\nreporting could materially affect JPMorgan Chase’s\nprofitability or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase’s\ndisclosure controls and procedures will be effective\nin every circumstance, or that a material weakness or\nsignificant deficiency in internal control over\nfinancial reporting will not occur. Any such lapses or\ndeficiencies could:\nmaterially and adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusiness and results of operations or financial\ncondition\nrestrict its ability to access the capital markets\nrequire it to expend significant resources to\ncorrect the lapses or deficiencies\nexpose it to litigation or regulatory fines,\npenalties or other sanctions\nharm its reputation, or\notherwise diminish investor confidence in JPMorgan\nChase.\nJPMorgan Chase could be adversely affected by changes\nin accounting standards or policies.\nThe preparation of JPMorgan Chase’s financial\nstatements is based on accounting standards\nestablished by the Financial Accounting Standards\nBoard and the Securities and Exchange Commission, as\nwell as more detailed accounting policies established\nby JPMorgan Chase’s management. From time to time\nthese accounting standards or\naccounting policies may change, and in some cases\nthese changes could have a significant effect on\nJPMorgan Chase’s financial statements and may\nadversely affect its financial results or investor\nperceptions of those results.\nAs of January 1, 2020, JPMorgan Chase implemented a\nnew accounting standard, commonly referred to as the\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses (“CECL”) framework,\nwhich requires earlier recognition of expected credit\nlosses on loans and certain other instruments. The\nallowance for credit losses related to certain of\nJPMorgan Chase’s loans and other lending-related\ncommitments portfolios increased upon implementation\nof CECL, which has had a negative impact on JPMorgan\nChase’s capital levels.\nThe ongoing impact of the adoption of CECL could\ninclude the following, each of which could result in\ndiminished investor confidence:\ngreater volatility in JPMorgan Chase’s earnings and\ncapital levels over economic cycles\npotential reductions in its capital distributions,\nor\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses.\nIn addition, JPMorgan Chase could be adversely\nimpacted by associated changes in the competitive\nenvironment in which it operates, including changes in\nthe availability or pricing of loan products,\nparticularly during periods of economic stress, as\nwell as changes related to non-U.S. financial\ninstitutions or other competitors that are not subject\nto this accounting standard.\nStrategic\nIf JPMorgan Chase’s management fails to develop and\nexecute effective business strategies, and to\nanticipate changes affecting those strategies,\nJPMorgan Chase’s competitive standing and results\ncould suffer.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business strategies significantly\naffect its competitive standing and operations. These\nstrategies relate to:\nthe products and services that JPMorgan Chase offers\nthe geographies in which it operates\nthe types of clients and customers that it serves\nthe counterparties with which it does business, and\nthe methods and distribution channels by which it\noffers products and services.\nIf management makes choices about these strategies and\ngoals that prove to be incorrect, do not accurately\nassess the competitive landscape and industry trends,\nor fail to address changing regulatory and market\nenvironments or the expectations of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, then the franchise values and growth\nprospects of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses may suffer\nand its earnings could decline.\nJPMorgan Chase’s growth prospects also depend on\nmanagement’s ability to develop and execute effective\n27",

Each of these objectives could be\nadversely affected by any failure on the part of\nmanagement to:\ndevise effective business plans and strategies\noffer products and services that meet changing\nexpectations of clients and customers\nallocate capital in a manner that promotes long-term\nstability to enable JPMorgan Chase to build and invest\nin market-leading businesses, even in a highly\nstressed environment\nallocate capital appropriately due to imprecise\nmodeling or subjective judgments made in connection\nwith those allocations\nappropriately address concerns of clients,\ncustomers, investors, employees and other\nstakeholders, including with respect to social and\nsustainability matters\nreact quickly to changes in market conditions or\nmarket structures, or\ndevelop and enhance the operational, technology,\nrisk, financial and managerial resources necessary to\ngrow and manage JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant and increasing\ncompetition in the rapidly evolving financial services\nindustry.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in a highly competitive\nenvironment in which it must evolve and adapt to the\nsignificant changes as a result of changes in\nfinancial regulation, technological advances,\nincreased public scrutiny and changes in economic\nconditions. JPMorgan Chase expects that competition in\nthe U.S. and global financial services industry will\ncontinue to be intense. Competitors include:\nother banks and financial institutions\ntrading, advisory and investment management firms\nfinance companies\ntechnology companies, and\nother nonbank firms that are engaged in providing\nsimilar products and services.\nJPMorgan Chase cannot provide assurance that the\nsignificant competition in the financial services\nindustry will not materially and adversely affect its\nfuture results of operations.\nNew competitors in the financial services industry\ncontinue to emerge. For example, technological\nadvances and the growth of e-commerce have made it\npossible for non-depository institutions to offer\nproducts and services that traditionally were banking\nproducts. These advances have\nalso allowed financial institutions and other\ncompanies to provide electronic and internet-based\nfinancial solutions, including electronic securities\ntrading, payments processing and online automated\nalgorithmic-based investment advice. Furthermore, both\nfinancial institutions and their non-banking\ncompetitors face the risk that payments processing and\nother services could be significantly disrupted by\ntechnologies, such as cryptocurrencies, that require\nno intermediation. New technologies have required and\ncould require JPMorgan Chase to spend more to modify\nor adapt its products to attract and retain clients\nand customers or to match products and services\noffered by its competitors, including technology\ncompanies. In addition, new technologies may be used\nby customers, or breached or infiltrated by third\nparties, in unexpected ways, which can increase\nJPMorgan Chase’s costs for complying with laws, rules\nand regulations that apply to the offering of products\nand services through those technologies and reduce the\nincome that JPMorgan Chase earns from providing\nproducts and services through those new technologies.\nOngoing or increased competition may put pressure on\nthe pricing for JPMorgan Chase’s products and services\nor may cause JPMorgan Chase to lose market share,\nparticularly with respect to traditional banking\nproducts such as deposits and bank accounts. This\ncompetition may be on the basis of quality and variety\nof products and services offered, transaction\nexecution, innovation, reputation and price. The\nfailure of any of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses to meet\nthe expectations of clients and customers, whether due\nto general market conditions, under-performance, a\ndecision not to offer a particular product or service,\nchanges in client and customer expectations or other\nfactors, could affect JPMorgan Chase’s ability to\nattract or retain clients and customers. Any such\nimpact could, in turn, reduce JPMorgan Chase’s\nrevenues. Increased competition also may require\nJPMorgan Chase to make additional capital investments\nin its businesses, or to extend more of its capital on\nbehalf of its clients in order to remain competitive.\nClimate change manifesting as physical or transition\nrisks could have a material adverse impact on JPMorgan\nChase’s business operations, clients and customers.\nJPMorgan Chase operates in many regions, countries and\ncommunities around the world where its businesses, and\nthe activities of its clients and customers, could be\nimpacted by climate change. Climate change could\nmanifest as a financial risk to JPMorgan Chase either\nthrough changes in the physical climate or from the\nprocess of transitioning to a low-carbon economy,\nincluding changes in climate policy or in the\nregulation of financial institutions with respect to\nrisks posed by climate change.\nClimate-related physical risks include both acute\nweather events and chronic shifts in the climate.\nPotential physical risks from climate change may\ninclude altered distribution and intensity of\nrainfall, prolonged droughts or flooding, increased\nfrequency of wildfires, rising sea levels, or a rising\nheat index.\n28\nTransition risks arise from the process of adjusting\nto a low-carbon economy. In addition to possible\nchanges in climate policy and financial regulation,\npotential transition risks may include economic and\nother changes engendered by the development of low-\ncarbon technological advances (e.g., electric vehicles\nand renewable energy) and/or changes in consumer\npreferences towards low-carbon goods and services.\nTransition risks could be further accelerated by the\noccurrence of changes in the physical climate.\nThese climate-related physical risks and transition\nrisks could have a financial impact on JPMorgan Chase\nboth directly on its business and operations and as a\nresult of material adverse impacts to its clients and\ncustomers, including:\ndeclines in asset values\nreduced availability of insurance\nsignificant interruptions to business operations,\nand\nnegative consequences to business models, and the\nneed to make changes in response to those\nconsequences.\nConduct\nConduct failure by JPMorgan Chase employees can harm\nclients and customers, impact market integrity, damage\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation and trigger litigation and\nregulatory action.\nJPMorgan Chase’s employees interact with clients,\ncustomers and counterparties, and with each other,\nevery day. All employees are expected to demonstrate\nvalues and exhibit the behaviors that are an integral\npart of JPMorgan Chase’s How We Do Business\nPrinciples, including JPMorgan Chase’s commitment to\n“do first class business in a first class way.”\nJPMorgan Chase endeavors to embed conduct risk\nmanagement throughout an employee’s life cycle,\nincluding recruiting, onboarding, training and\ndevelopment, and performance management. Conduct risk\nmanagement is also an integral component of JPMorgan\nChase’s promotion and compensation processes.\nNotwithstanding these expectations, policies and\npractices, certain employees have in the past engaged\nin improper or illegal conduct, and these instances of\nmisconduct have resulted in litigation as well as\nresolutions of governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions involving consent orders, deferred\nprosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements and\nother civil or criminal sanctions. There is no\nassurance that further inappropriate or unlawful\nactions by employees will not occur, lead to a\nviolation of the terms of these resolutions (and\nassociated consequences), or that any such actions\nwill always be detected, deterred or prevented.\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation could be harmed, and\ncollateral consequences could result, from a failure\nby one or more employees to act consistently with\nJPMorgan Chase’s expectations, policies and practices,\nincluding by acting in ways that harm clients,\ncustomers, other market\nparticipants or other employees. Some examples of this\ninclude:\nimproperly selling and marketing JPMorgan Chase’s\nproducts or services\nengaging in insider trading, market manipulation or\nunauthorized trading\nengaging in improper or fraudulent behavior in\nconnection with government relief programs\nfacilitating a transaction where a material\nobjective is to achieve a particular tax, accounting\nor financial disclosure treatment that may be subject\nto scrutiny by governmental or regulatory authorities,\nor where the proposed treatment is unclear or may not\nreflect the economic substance of the transaction\nfailing to fulfill fiduciary obligations or other\nduties owed to clients or customers\nviolating antitrust or anti-competition laws by\ncolluding with other market participants to manipulate\nmarkets, prices or indices\nengaging in discriminatory behavior or harassment\nwith respect to clients, customers or employees, or\nacting contrary to JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering\na diverse and inclusive workplace\nmanaging or reporting risks in ways that subordinate\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk appetite to business performance\ngoals or employee compensation objectives, and\nmisappropriating property, confidential or\nproprietary information, or technology assets\nbelonging to JPMorgan Chase, its clients and customers\nor third parties.\nThe consequences of any failure by employees to act\nconsistently with JPMorgan Chase’s expectations,\npolicies or practices could include litigation, or\nregulatory or other governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions.

Damage to JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation can therefore cause significant harm to\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and prospects, and can arise\nfrom numerous sources, including:\nemployee misconduct, including discriminatory\nbehavior or harassment with respect to clients,\ncustomers or employees, or actions that are contrary\nto JPMorgan Chase’s goal of fostering a diverse and\ninclusive workplace\nsecurity breaches, including as a result of cyber\nattacks\nfailure to safeguard client, customer or employee\ninformation\nfailure to manage risk issues associated with its\nbusiness activities or those of its clients, including\nfailure to fully discharge publicly-announced\ncommitments to support social and sustainability\ninitiatives\ncompliance or operational failures\nlitigation or regulatory fines, penalties or other\nsanctions\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions, or\nresolutions of these matters, and\nfailure or perceived failure of clients, customers,\ncounterparties or other parties to comply with laws,\nrules or regulations, including companies in which\nJPMorgan Chase has made principal investments, parties\nto joint ventures with JPMorgan Chase, and vendors\nwith which JPMorgan Chase does business.\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation may be significantly\ndamaged by adverse publicity or negative information\nregarding JPMorgan Chase, whether or not true, that\nmay be published or broadcast by the media or posted\non social media, non-mainstream news services or other\nparts of the internet. This latter risk can be\nmagnified by the speed and pervasiveness with which\ninformation is disseminated through those channels.\nSocial and environmental activists are increasingly\ntargeting financial services firms such as JPMorgan\nChase with public criticism for their relationships\nwith clients that are engaged in certain sensitive\nindustries, including businesses whose products are or\nare perceived to be harmful to human health, or whose\nactivities negatively affect or are perceived to\nnegatively affect the environment, workers’ rights or\ncommunities. Activists have also engaged in public\nprotests at JPMorgan Chase’s headquarters and other\nproperties. Activist criticism of JPMorgan Chase’s\nrelationships with clients in sensitive industries\ncould potentially engender dissatisfaction among\nclients, customers, investors and employees with how\nJPMorgan Chase addresses social and sustainability\nconcerns in its business activities. Alternatively,\nyielding to activism targeted at certain sensitive\nindustries could damage JPMorgan Chase’s relationships\nwith clients and customers, and with governmental or\nregulatory bodies in jurisdictions in which JPMorgan\nChase does business, whose views are not aligned with\nthose of social and environmental activists. In either\ncase, the resulting harm to JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation could:\ncause certain clients and customers to cease doing\nbusiness with JPMorgan Chase\nimpair JPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract new\nclients and customers, or to expand its relationships\nwith existing clients and customers\ndiminish JPMorgan Chase’s ability to hire or retain\nemployees\nprompt JPMorgan Chase to cease doing business with\ncertain clients or customers.\ncause certain investors to divest from investments\nin securities of JPMorgan Chase, or\nattract scrutiny from governmental or regulatory\nbodies.\nActions by the financial services industry generally\nor individuals in the industry can also affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation. For example, the\nreputation of the industry as a whole can be damaged\nby concerns that:\nconsumers have been treated unfairly by a financial\ninstitution,\na financial institution has acted inappropriately\nwith respect to the methods used to offer products to\ncustomers\nIf JPMorgan Chase is perceived to have engaged in\nthese types of behaviors, this could weaken its\nreputation among clients or customers.\nFailure to effectively manage potential conflicts of\ninterest can result in litigation and enforcement\nactions, as well as damage JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation.\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to manage potential conflicts\nof interest is highly complex due to the broad range\nof its business activities which encompass a variety\nof transactions, obligations and interests with and\namong JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers. JPMorgan\nChase can become subject to litigation and enforcement\nactions, and its reputation can be damaged, by the\nfailure or perceived failure to:\nadequately address or appropriately disclose\nconflicts of interest, including potential conflicts\nof interest that may arise in connection with\nproviding multiple products and services in, or having\none or more investments related to, the same\ntransaction\ndeliver appropriate standards of service and quality\n30\ntreat clients and customers with the appropriate\nstandard of care\nuse client and customer data responsibly and in a\nmanner that meets legal requirements and regulatory\nexpectations\nprovide fiduciary products or services in accordance\nwith the applicable legal and regulatory standards, or\nhandle or use confidential information of customers\nor clients appropriately or in compliance with\napplicable data protection and privacy laws, rules and\nregulations.\nA failure or perceived failure to appropriately\naddress conflicts of interest or fiduciary obligations\ncould result in customer dissatisfaction, litigation\nand regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions,\nand heightened regulatory scrutiny and enforcement\nactions, all of which can lead to lost revenue and\nhigher operating costs and cause serious harm to\nJPMorgan Chase’s reputation.\nCountry\nAn outbreak of hostilities between countries or within\na country or region could have a material adverse\neffect on the global economy and on JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses within the affected region or globally.\nAggressive actions by hostile governments or groups,\nincluding armed conflict or intensified cyber attacks,\ncould expand in unpredictable ways by drawing in other\ncountries or escalating into full-scale war with\npotentially catastrophic consequences, particularly if\none or more of the combatants possess nuclear weapons.\nDepending on the scope of the conflict, the\nhostilities could result in:\nworldwide economic disruption\nheightened volatility in financial markets\nsevere declines in asset values, accompanied by\nwidespread sell-offs of investments\nsubstantial depreciation of local currencies,\npotentially leading to defaults by borrowers and\ncounterparties in the affected region\ndisruption of global trade, and\ndiminished consumer, business and investor\nconfidence.\nAny of the above consequences could have significant\nnegative effects on JPMorgan Chase’s operations and\nearnings, both in the countries or regions directly\naffected by the hostilities or globally. Further, if\nthe U.S. were to become directly involved in such a\nconflict, this could lead to a curtailment of any\noperations that JPMorgan Chase may have in the\naffected countries or region, as well as in any nation\nthat is aligned against the U.S. in the hostilities.\nJPMorgan Chase could also experience more numerous and\naggressive cyber attacks launched by or under the\nsponsorship of one or more of the adversaries in such\na conflict.\nJPMorgan Chase’s business and operations in certain\ncountries can be adversely affected by local economic,\npolitical, regulatory and social factors.\nSome of the countries in which JPMorgan Chase conducts\nbusiness have economies or markets that are less\ndeveloped and more volatile or may have political,\nlegal and regulatory regimes that are less established\nor predictable than other countries in which JPMorgan\nChase operates. In addition, in some jurisdictions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase conducts business, the local\neconomy and business activity are subject to\nsubstantial government influence or control. Some of\nthese countries have in the past experienced economic\ndisruptions, including:\nextreme currency fluctuations\nhigh inflation\nlow or negative growth, and\ndefaults or reduced ability to service sovereign\ndebt.\nThe governments in these countries have sometimes\nreacted to these developments by imposing restrictive\npolicies that adversely affect the local and regional\nbusiness environment, including:\nprice, capital or exchange controls, including\nimposition of punitive transfer and convertibility\nrestrictions or forced currency exchange\nexpropriation or nationalization of assets or\nconfiscation of property, including intellectual\nproperty, and\nchanges in laws, rules and regulations.\nThe impact of these actions could be accentuated in\ntrading markets that are smaller, less liquid and more\nvolatile than more-developed markets. These types of\ngovernment actions can negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s operations in the relevant country, either\ndirectly or by suppressing the business activities of\nlocal clients or multi-national clients that conduct\nbusiness in the jurisdiction.\nIn addition, emerging markets countries, as well as\ncertain more developed countries, have been\nsusceptible to unfavorable social developments arising\nfrom poor economic conditions or governmental actions,\nincluding:\nwidespread demonstrations or civil unrest\ngeneral strikes and demonstrations\ncrime and corruption\nsecurity and personal safety issues\noutbreaks of hostilities\noverthrow of incumbent governments\nterrorist attacks, and\nother forms of internal discord.\nThese economic, political, regulatory and social\ndevelopments have in the past resulted in, and in the\nfuture\n31",

In addition, any of these events or\ncircumstances in one country can affect JPMorgan\nChase’s operations and investments in another country\nor countries, including in the U.S.\nPeople\nJPMorgan Chase’s ability to attract and retain\nqualified and diverse employees is critical to its\nsuccess.\nJPMorgan Chase’s employees are its most important\nresource, and in many areas of the financial services\nindustry, competition for qualified personnel is\nintense. JPMorgan Chase endeavors to attract talented\nand diverse new employees and retain, develop and\nmotivate its existing employees. If JPMorgan Chase\nwere unable to continue to attract or retain qualified\nand diverse employees, including successors to the\nChief Executive Officer or members of the Operating\nCommittee, JPMorgan Chase’s performance, including its\ncompetitive position, could be materially and\nadversely affected.\nUnfavorable changes in immigration or travel policies\ncould adversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and\noperations.\nJPMorgan Chase relies on the skills, knowledge and\nexpertise of employees located throughout the world.\nChanges in immigration or travel policies in the U.S.\nand other countries that unduly restrict or otherwise\nmake it more difficult for employees or their family\nmembers to work in, or travel to or transfer between,\njurisdictions in which JPMorgan Chase has operations\nor conducts its business could inhibit JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to attract and retain qualified\nemployees, and thereby dilute the quality of its\nworkforce, or could prompt JPMorgan Chase to make\nstructural changes to its worldwide or regional\noperating models that cause its operations to be less\nefficient or more costly.\nLegal\nJPMorgan Chase faces significant legal risks from\nlitigation and formal and informal regulatory and\ngovernment investigations.\nJPMorgan Chase is named as a defendant or is otherwise\ninvolved in many legal proceedings, including class\nactions and other litigation or disputes with third\nparties. Actions currently pending against JPMorgan\nChase may result in judgments, settlements, fines,\npenalties or other sanctions adverse to JPMorgan\nChase. Any of these matters could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s business, financial\ncondition or results of operations, or cause serious\nreputational harm. As a participant in the financial\nservices industry, it is likely that JPMorgan Chase\nwill continue to experience a high level of litigation\nand regulatory and government investigations related\nto its businesses and operations.\nRegulators and other government agencies conduct\nexaminations of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries\nboth on a routine basis and in targeted exams, and\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses and operations are subject\nto heightened regulatory oversight. This heightened\nregulatory scrutiny, or the results of such an\ninvestigation or examination, may lead to additional\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions.\nThere is no assurance that those actions will not\nresult in resolutions or other enforcement actions\nagainst JPMorgan Chase. Furthermore, a single event\ninvolving a potential violation of law or regulation\nmay give rise to numerous and overlapping\ninvestigations and proceedings, either by multiple\nfederal, state or local agencies and officials in the\nU.S. or, in some instances, regulators and other\ngovernmental officials in non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIf another financial institution violates a law or\nregulation relating to a particular business activity\nor practice, this will often give rise to an\ninvestigation by regulators and other governmental\nagencies of the same or similar activity or practice\nby JPMorgan Chase.\nThese and other initiatives by U.S. and non-U.S.\ngovernmental authorities may subject JPMorgan Chase to\njudgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other\nsanctions, and may require JPMorgan Chase to\nrestructure its operations and activities or to cease\noffering certain products or services. All of these\npotential outcomes could harm JPMorgan Chase’s\nreputation or lead to higher operational costs,\nthereby reducing JPMorgan Chase’s profitability, or\nresult in collateral consequences. In addition, the\nextent of JPMorgan Chase’s exposure to legal and\nregulatory matters can be unpredictable and could, in\nsome cases, exceed the amount of reserves that\nJPMorgan Chase has established for those matters.\n32",

Firmwide overview JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $29.1 billion for 2020, or $8.88 per\nshare, on net revenue of $119.5 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 12% and ROTCE of 14%. The Firm's results for 2020\nincluded net additions to the allowance for credit losses of $12.2 billion and Firmwide legal expense of $1.1\nbillion. • The Firm had net income of $29.1 billion, down 20%. • Total net revenue was up 4%. Noninterest revenue\nwas $65.0 billion, up 12%, driven by higher CIB Markets revenue, Investment Banking fees and net production revenue\nin Home Lending. Net interest income was $54.6 billion, down 5%, driven by the impact of lower rates,\npredominantly offset by higher net interest income in CIB Markets as well as balance sheet growth. • Noninterest\nexpense was $66.7 billion, up 2%, driven by higher volume- and revenue-related expense, legal expense and continued\ninvestments in the businesses, partially offset by lower structural expense. • The provision for credit losses was\n$17.5 billion, up $11.9 billion from the prior year, driven by net additions to the allowance for credit losses of\n$12.2 billion due to the deterioration and increased uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment as a result of\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. • The total allowance for credit losses was $30.8 billion at December 31,\n2020. The Firm had an allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 2.95%, compared with 1.39% in\nthe prior year; the increase from the prior year was driven by the additions to the allowance for credit losses and\nthe adoption of CECL. • The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.9 billion at December 31, 2020, an increase of\n$5.9 billion from the prior year, primarily reflecting client credit deterioration across multiple industries in\nthe wholesale portfolio; and in the consumer portfolio, loans placed on nonaccrual status related to the impact of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the adoption of CECL, as the purchased credit deteriorated loans in the mortgage\nportfolio became subject to nonaccrual loan treatment. In the fourth quarter of 2020, nonperforming assets\ndecreased $556 million from the prior quarter, reflecting some credit improvement in the wholesale portfolio. The\nconsumer portfolio remained relatively flat, as the increase in loans placed on nonaccrual status in Home Lending\nrelated to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was predominantly offset by lower loans at fair value in CIB,\nlargely due to sales. • Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 1%, driven by higher loan balances in AWM\nand CIB, as well as loans originated under the Small Business Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program\n(“PPP”), predominantly offset by lower loan balances in Home Lending and Card. • Firmwide average deposits of $1.9\ntrillion were up 25%, reflecting significant inflows across the Firm, primarily driven by the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic and the related effect of certain government actions. • As of December 31, 2020, the Firm had\naverage eligible High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $697 billion and unencumbered marketable\nsecurities with a fair value of approximately $740 billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity\nsources.

The Firm also provided\nadditional benefits to employees during the COVID-19\npandemic.\nSupporting communities\nSince March, the Firm has committed $250 million to\nhelp address humanitarian needs and long-term economic\nchallenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the\ncommunities in which the Firm operates. As of December\n31, 2020, over 75% of this commitment has been funded.\nDeparture of the U.K. from the EU\nThe U.K.’s departure from the EU, which is commonly\nreferred to as “Brexit,” was completed on December 31,\n2020. The U.K. and the EU have entered into a Trade\nand Cooperation Agreement which delineates many\nsignificant aspects of the future relationship between\nthe U.K. and the EU. However, the agreement contained\nvery limited provisions relating to cross-border\nfinancial services, and the U.K. and the EU are\nexpected to engage in further negotiations concerning\nfinancial services.\nThe Firm has executed and continues to execute on its\nFirmwide Brexit Implementation program, which\nencompasses a strategic implementation plan across all\nimpacted businesses and functions, including an\nongoing assessment of political, legal and regulatory\nand other implementation risks.

The\nFirm continues to actively engage with those clients\nthat have not completed re-documentation or required\noperational changes.\nBusiness and operations\nThe COVID-19 pandemic introduced additional risk to\nthe Firm’s Brexit Implementation program, particularly\nin relation to staff relocations. As a result, the\nFirm has worked closely with regulators and employees\nto ensure that critical staff are relocated in a safe\nand timely manner so that the Firm can meet its\nregulatory commitments and continue serving its\nclients. Further relocations are planned for 2021, and\nthe Firm’s longer-term EU staffing strategy will be\ndeveloped over time in cooperation with its regulators\nand as the post-Brexit market landscape evolves in\norder to ensure that the Firm maintains operational\nresilience and effective client coverage.\n50    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nInterbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition\nJPMorgan Chase and other market participants continue\nto make progress in preparing for the discontinuation\nof the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and\nother IBORs to comply with the International\nOrganization of Securities Commission’s standards for\ntransaction-based benchmark rates.\nOn November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration,\nthe administrator of LIBOR, announced a public\nconsultation on its proposal to cease the publication\nof the principal tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e.,\novernight, one-month, three-month, six-month and\n12-month LIBOR) immediately following a final\npublication on June 30, 2023. The Federal Reserve, the\nOCC and the FDIC also released guidance encouraging\nmarket participants to cease dealing in new U.S.\ndollar LIBOR contracts from the end of 2021. There has\nbeen no change in the scheduled cessation of U.K.\nsterling, Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, or\nthe remaining tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR, from\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe Firm continues to work towards reducing its\nexposure to IBOR-referencing contracts, including\nderivatives, bilateral and syndicated loans,\nsecurities, and debt and preferred stock issuances, to\nmeet the industry milestones and recommendations\npublished by National Working Groups (“NWG”),\nincluding the Alternative Reference Rates Committee\n(the “ARRC”) in the U.S.\nOn October 23, 2020, the International Swaps and\nDerivatives Association, Inc. (“ISDA”) published a new\nsupplement to the ISDA 2006 definitions and the\nrelated 2020 IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (the “Protocol”).\nThese publications are intended to facilitate the\nincorporation of robust rate fallback provisions into\nboth legacy and new derivative contracts with effect\nfrom January 25, 2021. The Firm’s client-facing legal\nentities have agreed to adhere to the Protocol, in\naccordance with recommendations from multiple industry\nworking groups, including the ARRC. ISDA further\nannounced that bilateral templates have been made\navailable for use with counterparties who choose not\nto adhere to the Protocol.\nAs a key objective of the ARRC’s transition plan to\nencourage adoption of the Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (“SOFR”), counterparty clearing houses, clearing\nhouse members and other impacted market participants\nsuccessfully executed the discounting and price\nalignment interest (“PAI”) switch from federal funds\nto SOFR on October 16, 2020. The industry completed a\nsimilar switch from EONIA to €STR on July 27, 2020.\nOn March 12, 2020 and January 7, 2021, the Financial\nAccounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued accounting\nstandards updates providing optional expedients and\nexceptions for applying generally accepted accounting\nprinciples to contracts and hedge accounting\nrelationships affected by reference rate reform. These\noptional expedients are intended to simplify the\noperational impact of applying U.S. GAAP to\ntransactions impacted by reference rate reform. The\nFirm elected to apply certain of these expedients\nbeginning in the third quarter of 2020. On\nAugust 27, 2020, the International Accounting\nStandards Board (“IASB”) issued guidance that provides\nsimilar relief for entities reporting under\nInternational Financial Reporting Standards (\"IFRS\").\nRefer to Accounting and Reporting Developments on page\n156 for additional information. The Firm continues to\nmonitor the transition relief being considered by the\nU.S. Treasury Department regarding the tax\nimplications of reference rate reform.\nThe Firm’s initiatives in connection with LIBOR\ntransition include:\ncontinuing to reduce its overall exposure to LIBOR\nimplementing rate fallback provisions developed by\nNWGs in new LIBOR contracts, where appropriate\ncontinuing to educate and inform clients on LIBOR\ntransition and the necessity to prepare for the\ncessation of LIBOR\nassisting clients with discontinuing their issuance\nor use of LIBOR-linked products within the timelines\nspecified by NWGs\nsupporting clients in their efforts to remediate\ncontracts linked to LIBOR, including contracts to\nwhich the Firm is a party, which it manages or for\nwhich it acts as agent\noffering products linked to alternative reference\nrates (“ARRs”) across its businesses, and\nplanning for the implementation of rate fallback\nmechanisms across products based on the conventions\nrecommended by NWGs to prepare for transition to ARRs\nupon the cessation of various IBORs.\nThe Firm is on schedule to implement necessary changes\nto operational and risk management systems in order to\ntransition away from IBORs, including by aiming to\nmeet proposed deadlines set by NWGs for the cessation\nof new contracts referencing these benchmarks. The\nFirm continues to engage with and remains committed to\nNWGs in devising solutions to unresolved issues\nrelating to IBOR transition.\nThe Firm continues to engage with market participants,\nNWGs and regulators to address market-wide challenges\nassociated with LIBOR transition, including efforts\nto:\nimprove liquidity in ARRs\ndevelop and introduce forward-looking term rates\nlinked to ARRs, and\nsupport legislative proposals in the U.S., the U.K.\nand the EU that aim to resolve concerns involving\n“tough legacy” contracts (i.e. contracts that do not\nprovide for automatic conversion to another rate or\nthat are difficult to amend in order to add rate\nfallback provisions).\nResolution of these challenges should provide more\ncertainty and help to provide a framework for market\nparticipants in transitioning away from IBORs.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    51\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nRegulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19\nPandemic\nSince March 2020, the U.S. government as well as\ncentral banks and banking authorities around the world\nhave taken and continue to take actions to help\nindividuals, households and businesses that have been\nadversely affected by the economic disruption caused\nby the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act and the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act, which were signed\ninto law on March 27, 2020 and December 27, 2020,\nrespectively, provide, among other things, funding to\nsupport loan facilities to assist consumers and\nbusinesses. Set forth below is a summary as of the\ndate of this Form 10-K of U.S. government actions\ncurrently impacting the Firm and U.S. government\nprograms in which the Firm is participating. The Firm\nwill continue to assess ongoing developments in\ngovernment actions in response to the COVID-19\npandemic.\nU.S. government actions\nEligible retained income definition. On March 17,\n2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\n(“OCC”), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve\nSystem (“Federal Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation (“FDIC”), collectively the\n“federal banking agencies,” issued an interim final\nrule (issued as final on August 26, 2020) that revised\nthe definition of “eligible retained income” in the\nregulatory capital rules that apply to all U.S.\nbanking organizations. On March 23, 2020, the Federal\nReserve issued an interim final rule (issued as final\non August 26, 2020) that revised the definition of\n“eligible retained income” for purposes of the total\nloss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”) buffer requirements\nthat apply to global systemically important banking\norganizations. The revised definition of eligible\nretained income makes any automatic limitations on\npayout distributions that could apply under the\nagencies’ capital rules or TLAC rule take effect on a\nmore graduated basis in the event that a banking\norganization’s capital, leverage and TLAC ratios were\nto decline below regulatory requirements (including\nbuffers). The March 17, 2020 interim final rule was\nissued, in conjunction with an interagency statement\nencouraging banking organizations to use their capital\nand liquidity buffers, to further support banking\norganizations’ abilities to lend to households and\nbusinesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nReserve requirements . On March 24, 2020, the Federal\nReserve issued an interim final rule (issued as final\non December 22, 2020) reducing reserve requirement\nratios for all depository institutions to zero\npercent, effective March 26, 2020, an action intended\nto free up liquidity in the banking system to support\nlending to households and businesses.\nRefer to Note 26 for additional information on the\nreduction to the reserve requirement.\nRegulatory Capital - Current Expected Credit Losses\n(“CECL”) transition delay . On March 31, 2020, the\nfederal banking agencies issued an interim final rule\n(issued as final on August 26, 2020) that provided\nbanking organizations with the option to delay the\neffects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years,\nfollowed by a three-year transition period (“CECL\ncapital transition provisions”). The Firm elected to\napply the CECL capital transition provisions.\nSupplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) temporary\nrevision . On April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve\nissued an interim final rule that requires, on a\ntemporary basis, the calculation of total leverage\nexposure for purposes of calculating the SLR for bank\nholding companies (“BHC”), to exclude the on-balance\nsheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits\nat Federal Reserve Banks. These exclusions became\neffective April 1, 2020, and will remain in effect\nthrough March 31, 2021.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 and\nNote 27 for additional information on the CECL capital\ntransition provisions, the impact to the Firm’s\ncapital metrics and the Firm’s SLR.\nLoan modifications. On April 7, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies along with the National Credit Union\nAdministration, and the Consumer Financial Protection\nBureau, in consultation with the state financial\nregulators, issued an interagency statement revising a\nMarch 22, 2020 interagency statement on loan\nmodifications and the reporting for financial\ninstitutions working with customers affected by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic (the “IA Statement”). The IA\nStatement reconfirmed that efforts to work with\nborrowers where the loans are prudently underwritten,\nand not considered past due or carried on nonaccrual\nstatus, should not result in the loans automatically\nbeing considered modified in a troubled debt\nrestructuring (“TDR”) for accounting and financial\nreporting purposes, or for purposes of their\nrespective risk-based capital rules, which would\notherwise require financial institutions subject to\nthe capital rules to hold more capital. The IA\nStatement also clarified the interaction between its\nprevious guidance and Section 4013 of the CARES Act,\nas extended by Section 541 of the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, which provides certain financial\ninstitutions with the option to suspend the\napplication of accounting guidance for TDRs for a\nlimited period of time for loan modifications made to\naddress the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Firm has granted various forms of assistance to\ncustomers and clients impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant\nmodifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19\nrelated loan modifications have not been considered\nTDRs because:\nthey represent short-term or other insignificant\nmodifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan\nmodification assessments or the IA Statement guidance,\nor\nthe Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend\nthe application of accounting guidance for TDRs as\nprovided by\n52    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nthe CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act.\nTo the extent that certain modifications do not meet\nany of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them\nas TDRs. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 112-113\nand Note 12 for additional information on the Firm’s\nloan modification activities.\nPPP . Beginning April 3, 2020, the PPP, established by\nthe CARES Act and administered by the SBA, authorized\neligible lenders to provide nonrecourse loans to\neligible borrowers until August 8, 2020 to provide an\nincentive for these businesses to keep their workers\non their payroll. As part of the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act, additional funding was provided\nfor new PPP loans beginning in early January 2021.\nThis program was designed to target smaller businesses\nas well as to simplify the loan forgiveness process\nfor loans under $150,000. As of February 19, 2021, the\nFirm has funded approximately $5 billion under this\nextension of the program.\nU.S. government facilities . Beginning in March 2020,\nthe Federal Reserve announced a suite of facilities\nusing its emergency lending powers under section 13(3)\nof the Federal Reserve Act to support the flow of\ncredit to individuals, households and businesses\nadversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and to\nsupport the broader economy.\nThe Firm has participated and is participating in the\nPPP and certain of the other government facilities and\nprograms, as needed, to assist its clients and\ncustomers or to support the broader economy.

Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. (b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card\nreward costs from marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period\namounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (c) Included operating lease income of $5.5\nbillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and $4.5 billion for the year ended December 31,\n2018. 2020 compared with 2019 Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB, reflecting: • higher equity\nunderwriting fees predominantly in follow-on offerings and convertible securities markets due to increased\nindustry-wide fees • higher debt underwriting fees in investment-grade and high-yield bonds d riven by increased\nindustry-wide fees and wallet share gains. The increased activity resulted in part from clients seeking liquidity\nin the first half of the year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to CIB segment results on pages 71–76 and\nNote 6 for additional information.\nPrincipal transactions revenue increased, predominantly in CIB, reflecting higher revenue in Fixed Income Markets,\ndriven by strong performance in Currencies & Emerging Markets, Rates, and Credit. The increase in principal\ntransactions revenue also reflected higher net valuations on several legacy equity investments in Corporate,\ncompared with net losses in the prior year. Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain cases have offsets\nacross other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets\nbusiness on a total revenue basis. Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 71–76 and pages 83–84,\nrespectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related fees decreased as a result of\nlower deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting lower transaction activity and the impact of fee refunds related to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic , predominantly offset by higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, as well as higher\nlending-related fees, particularly loan commitment fees in CIB. Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages\n67–70, pages 71–76 and pages 77–79, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Asset management,\nadministration and commissions revenue increased driven by: • higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of\nnet inflows into liquidity and long term products, and higher performance fees; and in CCB related to a higher\nlevel of investment assets • higher brokerage commissions in CIB and AWM on higher client-driven volume, partially\noffset by • lower volume of annuity sales in CCB. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment results on pages 67–70, pages\n71–76 and pages 80–82, respectively, and Note 6 for additional information. Investment securities gains/(losses)\nincreased due to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio, including sales of U.S. GSE and\ngovernment agency mortgage-backed securities, particularly in the first and third quarters of 2020 . Refer to\nCorporate segment results on pages 83–84 and Note 10 for additional information. Mortgage fees and related income\nincreased due to higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting higher mortgage production volumes and margins;\nthe prior year included gains on sales of certain loans. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 67–70, Note 6 and 15\nfor further information.\n54    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nCard income decreased due to: • lower net interchange income reflecting lower credit card sales volumes and debit\ncard transactions as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, largely offset by lower acquisition costs and\nhigher annual fees in CCB, and • lower merchant processing fees in CIB predominantly driven by a reporting\nreclassification of certain expenses to be a reduction of revenue in Merchant Services. Refer to CCB and CIB seg\nment results on pages 67–70 and pages 71–76, respectively, and Note 6 for further information. Other income\ndecreased reflecting: • Increased amortization on higher levels of alternative energy investments in CIB. The\nincreased amortization was more than offset by lower income tax expense from the associated tax credits • lower net\nvaluation gains on certain investments in AWM • net losses on certain equity investments in CIB, compared with net\ngains in the prior year • higher costs associated with using forward contracts to hedge certain non-U.S. dollar-\ndenominated net investment exposures, and • higher losses related to the early termination of certain of the Firm's\nlong-term debt in Treasury and CIO, partially offset by • a net increase from a gain on an equity investment. Net\ninterest income decreased due to the impact of lower rates, predominantly offset by higher net interest income in\nCIB Markets, as well as balance sheet growth. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.8 trillion, up\n$434 billion, and the yield was 2.34%, down 127 basis points (“bps”), primarily due to lower rates. The net yield\non these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.98%, a decrease of 48 bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was 2.30%,\ndown 97 bps. Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In conjunction with the adoption\nof CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and\nlending-related commitments from the consumer,\nexcluding credit card portfolio segment to the\nwholesale portfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining the allowance.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further\ninformation. 2020 compared with 2019 The provision for\ncredit losses increased in consumer and wholesale\nprimarily driven by the deterioration and uncertainty\nin the macroeconomic environment, in particular in the\nfirst half of 2020, as a result of the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. The increase in consumer reflected:\nnet additions of $7.4 billion to the allowance for\ncredit losses, consisting of $6.6 billion for Card,\n$520 million for Auto, $252 million for Business\nBanking, partially offset by • lower net charge-offs\nlargely in Card, reflecting lower charge-offs and\nhigher recoveries, primarily benefiting from payment\nassistance and government stimulus. The prior year\nincluded a $244 million net reduction in the allowance\nfor credit losses. The increase in wholesale reflected\na net addition of $4.7 billion to the allowance for\ncredit losses across the LOBs, impacting multiple\nindustries. The investment securities provision for\ncredit losses relates to the HTM portfolio, which\nbecame subject to the CECL accounting guidance\nbeginning on January 1, 2020.

Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation. Operating activities JPMorgan Chase’s operating assets and liabilities primarily support the Firm’s\nlending and capital markets activities. These assets and liabilities can vary significantly in the normal course of\nbusiness due to the amount and timing of cash flows, which are affected by client-driven and risk management\nactivities and market conditions. The Firm believes that cash flows from operations, available cash and other\nliquidity sources, and its capacity to generate cash through secured and unsecured sources, are sufficient to meet\nits operating liquidity needs. • In 2020, cash used primarily reflected higher trading assets, other assets, and\nsecurities borrowed, partially offset by higher trading liabilities and net income excluding noncash adjustments.\nIn 2019, cash provided primarily reflected net income excluding noncash adjustments, lower trading assets, and net\nproceeds of sales, securitizations, and paydowns of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by higher securities\nborrowed, an increase in other assets and a decrease in trading liabilities.\nInvesting activities The Firm’s investing activities predominantly include originating held-for-investment loans\nand investing in the investment securities portfolio, and other short-term instruments. • In 2020, cash used\nprimarily reflected net purchases of investment securities, higher net originations of loans, and higher securities\npurchased under resale agreements. • In 2019, cash used reflected net purchases of investment securities, partially\noffset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements, and net proceeds from sales and securitizations of\nloans held-for-investment. Financing activities The Firm’s financing activities include acquiring customer deposits\nand issuing long-term debt, as well as preferred stock. • In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and an\nincrease in securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by net payments of long-term\nborrowings. • In 2019, cash provided reflected higher deposits, partially offset by a decrease in short-term\nborrowings and net payments of long-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common\nstock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic disruptions\ncaused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the\nFederal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end\nof 2020. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 57-58, Capital Risk Management on pages\n91-101, and Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 for a further discussion of the activities affecting the\nFirm’s cash flows.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    59\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nOFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL\nCASH OBLIGATIONS\nIn the normal course of business, the Firm enters into\nvarious off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual\nobligations that may require future cash payments.\nCertain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet,\nwhile others are disclosed as off-balance sheet under\naccounting principles generally accepted in the U.S.\n(“U.S. GAAP”).\nSpecial-purpose entities\nThe Firm has several types of off–balance sheet\narrangements, including through nonconsolidated\nspecial-purpose entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of\nVIE, and through lending-related financial instruments\n(e.g., commitments and guarantees).\nThe Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all\nSPE-related transactions and related exposures, such\nas derivative contracts and lending-related\ncommitments and guarantees.\nThe Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to\nsupport any SPE transaction, and its policies require\nthat transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s\nlength and reflect market pricing. Consistent with\nthis policy, no JPMorgan Chase employee is permitted\nto invest in SPEs with which the Firm is involved\nwhere such investment would violate the Firm’s Code of\nConduct.\nThe table below provides an index of where in this\n2020 Form 10-K discussions of the Firm’s various off-\nbalance sheet arrangements can be found.

That\npresentation, which is referred to as “reported”\nbasis, provides the reader with an understanding of\nthe Firm’s results that can be tracked consistently\nfrom year-to-year and enables a comparison of the\nFirm’s performance with the U.S. GAAP financial\nstatements of other companies.\nIn addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a\nreported basis, management reviews Firmwide results,\nincluding the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis;\nthese Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. The Firm also reviews the results\nof the LOBs on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition\nof managed basis starts, in each case, with the\nreported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue for the\nFirm (and each of the reportable business segments) on\nan FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments\nthat receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is\npresented in the managed results on a basis comparable\nto taxable investments and securities. These financial\nmeasures allow\nmanagement to assess the comparability of revenue from\nyear-to-year arising from both taxable and tax-exempt\nsources. The corresponding income tax impact related\nto tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax\nexpense.

Morgan Wealth Management\nbusiness unit within CCB. Prior-period amounts have\nbeen revised to conform with the current presentation,\nincluding the transfer of approximately 1,650\ntechnology and support staff during the second and\nthird quarters of 2020. Ultra-high-net-worth and\ncertain high-net-worth client relationships remained\nin AWM.\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting\na Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB\nfollowing a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale\npayments businesses. The Wholesale Payments business\ncomprises:\nMerchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to\nCIB\nTreasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade\nFinance was previously reported in Lending in CIB.\nIn connection with the alignment of Wholesale\nPayments, the assets, liabilities and headcount\nassociated with the Merchant Services business were\nrealigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and\nexpenses of the Merchant Services business are\nreported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on\nclient relationships. In the fourth quarter of 2020,\npayment processing-only clients along with the\nassociated revenue and expenses were realigned to\nCIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB.\nPayment processing-only clients are those that only\nuse payment services offered by Merchant Services, and\nin general do not currently utilize other services\noffered by the Firm. Prior-period amounts have been\nrevised\nto reflect this realignment and revised allocation\nmethodology.\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\nResults of the business segments are intended to\npresent each segment as if it were a stand-alone\nbusiness. The management reporting process that\nderives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm also assesses the level of capital required for\neach LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies\nand reporting classifications used for segment\nreporting, and further refinements may be implemented\nin future periods.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments join efforts to sell products\nand services to the Firm’s clients, the participating\nbusiness segments may agree to share revenue from\nthose transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in\nthe segment responsible for the related product or\nservice, with allocations to the other segment(s)\ninvolved in the transaction. The segment results\nreflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\nExpense Allocation\nWhere business segments use services provided by\ncorporate support units, or another business segment,\nthe costs of those services are allocated to the\nrespective business segments. The expense is generally\nallocated based on the actual cost and use of services\nprovided. In contrast, certain costs and investments\nrelated to corporate support units, technology and\noperations not currently utilized by any LOB, are not\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    65\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nallocated to the business segments and are retained in\nCorporate. Expense retained in Corporate generally\nincludes parent company costs that would not be\nincurred if the segments were stand-alone businesses;\nand other items not aligned with a particular business\nsegment.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing is the process by which the\nFirm allocates interest income and expense to each\nbusiness segment and transfers the primary interest\nrate risk and liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and\nCIO within Corporate. The funds transfer pricing\nprocess considers the interest rate risk, liquidity\nrisk and regulatory requirements on a product-by-\nproduct basis within each business segment.\nDebt expense and preferred stock dividend allocation\nAs part of the funds transfer pricing process, almost\nall of the cost of the credit spread component of\noutstanding unsecured long-term debt and preferred\nstock dividends is allocated to the reportable\nbusiness segments, while the balance of the cost is\nretained in Corporate. The methodology to allocate the\ncost of unsecured long-term debt and preferred stock\ndividends to the business segments is aligned with the\nFirm’s process to allocate capital. The allocated cost\nof unsecured long-term debt is included in a business\nsegment’s net interest income, and net income is\nreduced by preferred stock dividends to arrive at a\nbusiness segment’s net income applicable to common\nequity.\nBusiness segment capital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each business is\nreferred to as equity. As of January 1, 2021, the Firm\nhas changed its line of business capital allocations\nprimarily as a result of changes in exposures for each\nLOB and an increase in the relative risk weighting\ntoward Standardized RWA.

Markets revenue was $29.5 billion, up\n41%.\nFixed Income Markets revenue was $20.9 billion, up\n45%, driven by strong client activity across products\nprimarily in Rates, Credit, Currencies & Emerging\nMarkets, and Securitized Products.\nEquity Markets revenue was $8.6 billion, up 33%,\ndriven by strong client activity across products.\nSecurities Services revenue was $4.3 billion, up 2%,\ndriven by deposit balance and fee growth largely\noffset by deposit margin compression.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.7 billion,\ncompared with $277 million in the prior year. The\nincrease was driven by net additions to the allowance\nfor credit losses as a result of the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic across multiple industries.\nNoninterest expense was $23.5 billion, up 5%, driven\nby higher volume- and revenue-related expense and\nlegal expense.\n72    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nSelected metrics\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except headcount)\n2020                                                        2019                  2018\nSelected balance sheet data (period-end)\nAssets                                      $  1,097,219            $  914,705            $  909,292\nLoans:\nLoans retained(a)                                133,296               121,733               129,389\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair             39,588                34,317                36,407\nvalue(b)(c)\nTotal loans                                      172,884               156,050               165,796\nEquity                                            80,000                80,000                70,000\nSelected balance sheet data (average)\nAssets                                      $  1,122,939            $  993,508            $  930,126\nTrading assets-debt and equity                   422,237               376,182               321,280\ninstruments(c)\nTrading assets-derivative receivables             72,065                48,196                60,552\nLoans:\nLoans retained(a)                                135,676               122,371               114,417\nLoans held-for-sale and loans at fair             33,792                32,884                30,317\nvalue(b)(c)\nTotal loans                                      169,468               155,255               144,734\nEquity                                            80,000                80,000                70,000\nHeadcount                                         61,733                60,013                58,572\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services\nbusiness was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the\nFirm’s Wholesale Payments business.

Markets consists of\nFixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets\nrevenue comprises principal transactions, fees,\ncommissions and other income, as well as net interest\nincome. The Firm assesses its Markets business\nperformance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may\noccur across revenue line items. For example,\nsecurities that generate net interest income may be\nrisk-managed by derivatives that are recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7\nfor a description of the composition of these income\nstatement line items.\nPrincipal transactions reflects revenue on financial\ninstruments and commodities transactions that arise\nfrom client-driven market-making activity. Principal\ntransactions revenue includes amounts recognized upon\nexecuting new transactions with market participants,\nas well as “inventory-related revenue”, which is\nrevenue recognized from gains and losses on\nderivatives and other instruments that the Firm has\nbeen holding in anticipation of, or in response to,\nclient demand, and changes in the fair value of\ninstruments used by the Firm to actively manage the\nrisk exposure arising from such inventory. Principal\ntransactions revenue recognized upon executing new\ntransactions with market participants is driven by\nmany factors including the level of client activity,\nthe bid-offer spread (which is the difference\nbetween the price at which a market participant is\nwilling and able to sell an instrument to the Firm and\nthe price at which another market participant is\nwilling and able to buy it from the Firm, and vice\nversa), market liquidity and volatility. These factors\nare interrelated and sensitive to the same factors\nthat drive inventory-related revenue, which include\ngeneral market conditions, such as interest rates,\nforeign exchange rates, credit spreads, and equity and\ncommodity prices, as well as other macroeconomic\nconditions.\n74    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nFor the periods presented below, the predominant source of principal transactions revenue was the amount recognized\nupon executing new transactions.\nYe…\nen…\nDe…\n31,\n(in\nmi…\nex…       2020                                2019                                2018\nwh…       Fix…                                Fix…                                Fix…\not…       Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…          Inc…       Equ…       Tot…\nno…       Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…          Mar…       Mar…       Mar…\nPr…    $  11,…    $  6,0…    $  17,…       $  8,7…    $  5,7…    $  14,…       $  7,5…    $  5,5…    $  13,…\ntr…\nLe…\nand        226         10        236           198          7        205           197          6        203\nde…\nfe…\nAs…\nma…\nad…        411       2,0…       2,4…           407       1,7…       2,1…           410       1,7…       2,2…\nand\nco…\nAll\not…        493        -62        431           872          8        880           952         22        974\nin…\nNo…       12,…       8,1…       21,…          10,…       7,5…       17,…          9,1…       7,3…       16,…\nre…\nNet\nin…       7,8…        483       8,3…          4,1…       -1,…       3,1…          3,5…       -500       3,0…\nin…\nTo…\nnet    $  20,…    $  8,6…    $  29,…       $  14,…    $  6,4…    $  20,…       $  12,…    $  6,8…    $  19,…\nre…\nLo…                                   4                                   1                                   5\nda…\n(a) Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and Equity\nMarkets, posted losses to total net revenue.

Net revenue was $9.3 billion, flat compared to the prior year. Net interest income was $6.2 billion,\na decrease of 5%, driven by deposit margin compression, predominantly offset by higher deposit balances and lending\nrevenue. Noninterest revenue was $3.1 billion, an increase of 13%, driven by higher deposit-related fees,\nparticularly cash management fees, higher investment banking revenue, and a gain on a strategic investment. The\nincrease was partially offset by a $56 million markdown of a held-for-sale position and lower card income,\nprimarily due to lower volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, an\nincrease of 2%, driven by higher compensation expense. The provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion, compared\nto $296 million in the prior year. The increase was driven by net additions to the allowance for credit losses as a\nresult of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic across multiple industries.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    77\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCB product revenue consists of the following:\nLendingincludes a variety of financing\nalternatives, which are primarily provided on a\nsecured basis; collateral includes receivables,\ninventory, equipment, real estate or other assets.\nProducts include term loans, revolving lines of\ncredit, bridge financing, asset-based structures,\nleases, and standby letters of credit.\nWholesale paymentsincludes revenue from a broad\nrange of products and services that enable CB\nclients to manage payments and receipts, as well\nas invest and manage funds.\nInvestment bankingincludes revenue from a range of\nproducts providing CB clients with sophisticated\ncapital-raising alternatives, as well as balance\nsheet and risk management tools through advisory,\nequity underwriting, and loan syndications.\nRevenue from Fixed Income and Equity Markets\nproducts used by CB clients is also included.\nOtherproduct revenue primarily includes\ntax-equivalent adjustments generated from\nCommunity Development Banking activities and\ncertain income derived from principal\ntransactions.\nSelected income statement data (continued)\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions, except ratios)                      2020           2019           2018\nRevenue by product\nLending                                       $  4,396       $  4,057       $  4,049\nWholesale payments                               3,715          4,200          4,351\nInvestment banking(a)                            1,069            919            852\nOther                                              133             88             84\nTotal Commercial Banking net revenue          $  9,313       $  9,264       $  9,336\nInvestment banking revenue, gross(b)          $  3,348       $  2,744       $  2,491\nRevenue by client segment\nMiddle Market Banking                         $  3,640       $  3,805       $  3,797\nCorporate Client Banking                         3,203          3,119          3,119\nCommercial Real Estate Banking                   2,313          2,169          2,251\nOther                                              157            171            169\nTotal Commercial Banking net revenue          $  9,313       $  9,264       $  9,336\nFinancial ratios\nReturn on equity                                    11  %          17  %          20  %\nOverhead ratio                                      41             40             39\nIn the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services\nbusiness was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the\nFirm’s Wholesale Payments business.

Net revenue was $14.2 billion, an increase\nof 5%. Net interest income was $3.4 billion, up 2%, driven by higher deposit and loan balances as well as loan\nmargin expansion, offset by deposit margin compression. Noninterest revenue was $10.8 billion, up 6%, predominantly\ndriven by higher asset management fees as a result of net inflows into liquidity and long term products, higher\nperformance fees and increased brokerage commissions on higher client-driven volume, partially offset by lower net\ninvestment valuation gains. Revenue from Asset Management was $7.7 billion, up 6%, predominantly driven by higher\nasset management fees as a result of net inflows into liquidity products as well as higher performance fees,\npartially offset by lower net investment valuation gains. Revenue from Wealth Management was $6.6 billion, up 4%,\npredominantly driven by higher deposit and loan balances, increased brokerage commissions and asset management\nfees, largely offset by deposit margin compression. The provision for credit losses was $263 million, driven by\nadditions to the allowance for credit losses, predominantly as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nNoninterest expense was $10.0 billion, an increase of 2%, driven by legal expense, volume- and revenue-related\nexpense as well as investments in the business, partially offset by lower structural expense.\n80    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nAWM’s client segments consist of the following:\nPrivate Bankingclients include high- and\nultra-high-net-worth individuals, families, money\nmanagers and business owners.\nInstitutionalclients include both corporate and\npublic institutions, endowments, foundations,\nnonprofit organizations and governments worldwide.\nRetailclients include financial intermediaries and\nindividual investors.\nAsset Management has two high-level measures of\nits overall fund performance.\nPercentage of mutual fund assets under management\nin funds rated 4- or 5-star:\nMutual fund rating services rank funds based on\ntheir risk-adjusted performance over various\nperiods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and\nrepresents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked\nfunds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5%\nof industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating\nrepresents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked\nfunds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5%\nof industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is\nthe worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of\nindustry-wide ranked funds. The“overall\nMorningstar rating”is derived from a weighted\naverage of the performance associated with a\nfund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable)\nMorningstar Rating metrics. For U.S. domiciled\nfunds, separate star ratings are given at the\nindividual share class level. The Nomura“star\nrating”is based on three-year risk-adjusted\nperformance only. Funds with fewer than three\nyears of history are not rated and hence excluded\nfrom this analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer\ncategories and the asset values used to derive\nthis analysis are sourced from these fund rating\nproviders mentioned in footnote (a). The data\nproviders re-denominate the asset values into U.S.\ndollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings at\nthe share class level for U.S. domiciled funds,\nand at a“primary share class”level to represent\nthe star rating of all other funds except for\nJapan where Nomura provides ratings at the fund\nlevel. The “primary share class”, as defined by\nMorningstar, denotes the share class recommended\nas being the best proxy for the portfolio and in\nmost cases will be the most retail version (based\nupon annual management charge, minimum investment,\ncurrency and other factors). The performance data\ncould have been different if all funds/accounts\nwould have been included.

Quartile\nrankings are done on the net-of-fee absolute\nreturn of each fund. The data providers\nre-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars.\nThis % of AUM is based on fund performance and\nassociated peer rankings at the share class level\nfor U.S. domiciled funds and at the “primary share\nclass” level or fund level for all other funds.\nThe “primary share class”, as defined by\nMorningstar, denotes the share class recommended\nas being the best proxy for the portfolio and in\nmost cases will be the most retail version (based\nupon annual management charge, minimum investment,\ncurrency and other factors).

Net revenue was a loss of $1.2 billion, compared with revenue of $1.2 billion in the prior year, driven by\nlower net interest income partially offset by higher noninterest revenue. The decrease in net interest income was\npredominantly driven by lower rates, including the impact of faster prepayments on mortgage-backed securities, as\nwell as limited opportunities to deploy funds in response to significant deposit growth across the LOBs.\nNoninterest revenue increased reflecting higher net valuations on certain legacy equity investments and higher net\ninvestment securities gains due to the repositioning of the investment securities portfolio. Noninterest expense of\n$1.4 billion was up $305 million driven by an impairment on a legacy investment. The provision for credit losses\nrelates to the HTM portfolio, which became subject to the CECL accounting guidance beginning on January 1, 2020.\nRefer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional information on the investment securities portfolio and the allowance\nfor credit losses. The current period income tax benefit was predominantly driven by a lower level of pre-tax\nincome and changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes.\nThe prior period included $1.1 billion of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax audits.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    83\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nTreasury and CIO overview Treasury and CIO is predominantly responsible for measuring, monitoring, reporting and\nmanaging the Firm’s liquidity, funding, capital, structural interest rate and foreign exchange risks. The risks\nmanaged by Treasury and CIO arise from the activities undertaken by the Firm’s four major reportable business\nsegments to serve their respective client bases, which generate both on- and off-balance sheet assets and\nliabilities. Treasury and CIO seek to achieve the Firm’s asset-liability management objectives generally by\ninvesting in high-quality securities that are managed for the longer-term as part of the Firm’s investment\nsecurities portfolio. Treasury and CIO also use derivatives to meet the Firm ’ s asset-liability management\nobjectives. Refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives.

When the Firm extends a consumer or\nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their\ninvestment decisions, makes markets in securities, or\noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is\nto manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in\na manner that balances serving the interests of its\nclients, customers and investors and protects the\nsafety and soundness of the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that effective risk management\nrequires, among other things:\nAcceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm;\nOwnership of risk identification, assessment, data\nand management within each of the LOBs and Corporate;\nand\nFirmwide structures for risk governance.\nThe Firm follows a disciplined and balanced\ncompensation framework with strong internal governance\nand independent oversight by the Board of Directors\n(the “Board”). The impact of risk and control issues\nis carefully considered in the Firm’s performance\nevaluation and incentive compensation processes.\nRisk governance and oversight framework\nThe Firm’s risk management governance and oversight\nframework involves understanding drivers of risks,\ntypes of risks, and impacts of risks.\nDrivers of Risks are factors that cause a risk to\nexist. Drivers of risks include the economic\nenvironment, regulatory and government policy,\ncompetitor and market evolution, business decisions,\nprocess and judgment error, deliberate wrongdoing,\ndysfunctional markets, and natural disasters.\nTypes of Risks are categories by which risks manifest\nthemselves. Risks are generally categorized in the\nfollowing four risk types:\nStrategic risk is the risk to earnings, capital,\nliquidity or reputation associated with poorly\ndesigned or failed business plans or inadequate\nresponse to changes in the operating environment.\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated\nwith the default or change in credit profile of a\nclient, counterparty or customer; or loss of principal\nor a reduction in expected returns on investments,\nincluding\nconsumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk, and\ninvestment portfolio risk.\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect\nof changes in market factors, such as interest and\nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices,\ncredit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value\nof assets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nOperational risk is the risk associated with an\nadverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed\ninternal processes or systems; human factors; or\nexternal events impacting the Firm’s processes or\nsystems. It includes compliance, conduct, legal, and\nestimations and model risk.\nImpacts of Risks are consequences of risks, both\nquantitative and qualitative. There may be many\nconsequences of risks manifesting, including\nquantitative impacts such as a reduction in earnings\nand capital, liquidity outflows, and fines or\npenalties, or qualitative impacts such as reputation\ndamage, loss of clients and customers, and regulatory\nand enforcement actions.\nThe Firm’s risk governance and oversight framework is\nmanaged on a Firmwide basis. The Firm has an\nIndependent Risk Management (“IRM”) function, which\nconsists of the Risk Management and Compliance\norganizations. The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”)\nappoints, subject to approval by the Risk Committee of\nthe Board (“Board Risk Committee”), the Firm’s Chief\nRisk Officer (“CRO”) to lead the IRM organization and\nmanage the risk governance structure of the Firm. The\nframework is subject to approval by the Board Risk\nCommittee in the form of the Risk Governance and\nOversight Policy. The Firm’s CRO oversees and\ndelegates authorities to LOB CROs, Firmwide Risk\nExecutives (“FREs”), and the Firm’s Chief Compliance\nOfficer (“CCO”), who each establish Risk Management\nand Compliance organizations, set the Firm’s risk\ngovernance policies and standards, and define and\noversee the implementation of the Firm’s risk\ngovernance. The LOB CROs are responsible for risks\nthat arise in their LOBs, while FREs oversee risk\nareas that span across the individual LOBs, functions\nand regions.\nThree lines of defense\nThe Firm relies upon each of its LOBs and Corporate\nareas giving rise to risk to operate within the\nparameters identified by the IRM function, and within\nits own management-identified risk and control\nstandards. Each LOB and Treasury & CIO, including\ntheir aligned Operations, Technology and Control\nManagement, are the Firm’s “first line of defense” and\nown the identification of risks, as well as the design\nand execution of controls to manage those risks. The\nfirst line of defense is responsible for adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations and for the\nimplementation of the risk management structure (which\nmay include policy, standards, limits, thresholds and\ncontrols) established by IRM.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    85\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe IRM function is independent of the businesses and\nis the Firm’s “second line of defense.” The IRM\nfunction independently assesses and challenges the\nfirst line of defense risk management practices. IRM\nis also responsible for its own adherence to\napplicable laws, rules and regulations and for the\nimplementation of policies and standards established\nby IRM with respect to its own processes.\nInternal Audit is an independent function that\nprovides objective assessment on the adequacy and\neffectiveness of Firmwide processes, controls,\ngovernance and risk management as the “third line of\ndefense.” The Internal Audit Function is headed by the\nGeneral Auditor, who reports to the Audit Committee\nand administratively to the CEO.\nIn addition, there are other functions that contribute\nto the Firmwide control environment but are not\nconsidered part of a particular line of defense,\nincluding Finance, Human Resources and Legal.\nRisk identification and ownership\nEach LOB and Corporate area owns the ongoing\nidentification of risks, as well as the design and\nexecution of controls, inclusive of IRM-specified\ncontrols, to manage those risks. To support this\nactivity, the Firm has a formal Risk Identification\nframework designed to facilitate their responsibility\nto identify material risks inherent to the Firm,\ncatalog them in a central repository and review the\nmost material risks on a regular basis. The IRM\nfunction reviews and challenges the LOB and\nCorporate’s identified risks, maintains the central\nrepository and provides the consolidated Firmwide\nresults to the Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) and\nBoard Risk Committee.\nRisk appetite\nThe Firm’s overall appetite for risk is governed by a\n“Risk Appetite” framework. The framework and the\nFirm’s risk appetite are set and approved by the\nFirm’s CEO, Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) and CRO.\nQuantitative parameters and qualitative factors are\nused to monitor and measure the Firm’s capacity to\ntake risk consistent with its stated risk appetite.\nQualitative factors have been established to assess\nselect operational risks, and impact to the Firm’s\nreputation. Risk Appetite results are reported to the\nBoard Risk Committee.\n86    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nRisk governance and oversight structure\nThe independent status of the IRM function is\nsupported by a governance structure that provides for\nescalation of risk issues to senior management, the\nFRC, and the Board of Directors, as appropriate.\nThe chart below illustrates the committees of the\nBoard of Directors and key senior management-level\ncommittees in the Firm’s risk governance structure. In\naddition, there are other committees, forums and paths\nof escalation that support the oversight of risk which\nare not shown in the chart below or described in this\nForm 10-K.\nThe Firm’s Operating Committee, which consists of the\nFirm’s CEO, CRO, CFO, General Counsel, CEOs of the\nLOBs and other senior executives, is accountable to\nand may refer matters to the Firm’s Board of\nDirectors. The Operating Committee is responsible for\nescalating to the Board the information necessary to\nfacilitate the Board’s exercise of its duties.\nBoard oversight\nThe Firm’s Board of Directors provides oversight of\nrisk. The Board Risk Committee is the principal\ncommittee that oversees risk matters. The Audit\nCommittee oversees the control environment, and the\nCompensation & Management Development Committee\noversees compensation and other management-related\nmatters. Each committee of the Board oversees\nreputational risks and conduct risks within its scope\nof responsibility.\nThe JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board of Directors is\nresponsible for the oversight of management of the\nbank. The JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Board accomplishes\nthis function acting directly and through the\nprincipal standing committees of the Firm’s Board of\nDirectors. Risk and control oversight on behalf of\nJPMorgan Chase Bank N.A. is primarily the\nresponsibility of the Risk Committee and the Audit\nCommittee, respectively, and, with respect to\ncompensation and other management-related matters, the\nCompensation & Management Development Committee.\nThe Board Risk Committee assists the Board in its\noversight of management’s responsibility to implement\na global risk management framework reasonably designed\nto identify, assess and manage the Firm’s risks. The\nBoard Risk Committee’s responsibilities include\napproval of applicable primary risk policies and\nreview of certain associated frameworks, analysis and\nreporting established by management. Breaches in risk\nappetite and parameters, issues that may have a\nmaterial adverse impact on the Firm, including capital\nand liquidity issues, and other significant risk-\nrelated matters are escalated to the Board Risk\nCommittee, as appropriate.\nThe Audit Committee assists the Board in its oversight\nof management’s responsibility to ensure that there is\nan effective system of controls reasonably designed to\nsafeguard the Firm’s assets and income, ensure the\nintegrity of the Firm’s financial statements, and\nmaintain compliance with the Firm’s ethical standards,\npolicies, plans and procedures, and with laws and\nregulations. It also assists the Board in its\noversight of the Firm’s independent registered public\naccounting firm’s qualifications, independence and\nperformance, and of the performance of the Firm’s\nInternal Audit function.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    87\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe Compensation & Management Development Committee\n(“CMDC”) assists the Board in its oversight of the\nFirm’s compensation principles and practices. The CMDC\nreviews and approves the Firm’s compensation and\nqualified benefits programs. The Committee reviews the\nperformance of Operating Committee members against\ntheir goals, and approves their compensation awards.\nIn addition, the CEO’s award is subject to\nratification by the independent directors of the\nBoard. The CMDC also reviews the development of and\nsuccession for key executives, and provides oversight\nof the Firm’s culture, including reviewing updates\nfrom management regarding significant conduct issues\nand any related employee actions, including\ncompensation actions.\nThe Public Responsibility Committee assists the Board\nin its oversight of the Firm's positions and practices\non public responsibility matters such as community\ninvestment, fair lending, sustainability, consumer\npractices and other public policy issues that reflect\nthe Firm's values and character and could impact the\nFirm's reputation among its stakeholders. The\nCommittee also provides guidance on these matters to\nmanagement and the Board, as appropriate.\nThe Corporate Governance & Nominating Committee\nexercises general oversight with respect to the\ngovernance of the Board of Directors. It reviews the\nqualifications of and recommends to the Board of\nDirectors proposed nominees for election to the Board.\nThe Committee evaluates and recommends to the Board\ncorporate governance practices applicable to the Firm.\nIt also appraises the framework for assessing the\nBoard’s performance and self-evaluation.\nManagement oversight\nThe Firm’s senior management-level committees that are\nprimarily responsible for key risk-related functions\ninclude:\nThe Firmwide Risk Committee (“FRC”) is the Firm’s\nhighest management-level risk committee. It provides\noversight of the risks inherent in the Firm’s\nbusinesses and serves as an escalation point for risk\ntopics and issues raised by underlying committees\nand/or FRC members.\nThe Firmwide Control Committee (“FCC”) is an\nescalation committee for senior management to review\nand discuss the Firmwide operational risk environment\nincluding identified issues, operational risk metrics\nand significant events that have been escalated.\nLine of Business and Regional Risk Committees are\nresponsible for providing oversight of the governance,\nlimits, and controls that are in place through the\nscope of their activities. These committees review the\nways in which the particular LOB or the business\noperating in a particular region could be exposed to\nadverse outcomes with a focus on identifying,\naccepting, escalating and/or requiring remediation of\nmatters brought to these committees.\nLine of Business and Corporate Function Control\nCommittees over see the operational risk and control\nenvironment of their respective business or function,\ninclusive of Operational Risk, Compliance and Conduct\nRisks. As part of that mandate, they are responsible\nfor reviewing indicators of elevated or emerging risks\nand other data that may impact the level of operating\nrisk in a business or function, addressing key\noperational risk issues , focusing on processes with\ncontrol concerns and overseeing control remediation.\nThe Asset and Liability Committee (“ALCO”) is\nresponsible for overseeing the Firm’s asset and\nliability management (“ALM”) activities and the\nmanagement of liquidity risk, balance sheet, interest\nrate risk, and capital risk.\nThe Firmwide Valuation Governance Forum (“VGF”) is\ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives and is\nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks\narising from valuation activities conducted across the\nFirm.\n88    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nRisk governance and oversight functions The Firm\nmanages its risk through risk governance and oversight\nfunctions. The scope of a particular function may\ninclude one or more drivers, types and/or impacts of\nrisk. For example, Country Risk Management oversees\ncountry risk which may be a driver of risk or an\naggregation of exposures that could give rise to\nmultiple risk types such as credit or market risk.

Strategic\nrisks are overseen by IRM through participation in\nrelevant business reviews, LOB and Corporate senior\nmanagement meetings, risk and control committees and\nother relevant governance forums and ongoing\ndiscussions. The Board of Directors oversees\nmanagement’s strategic decisions, and the Board Risk\nCommittee oversees IRM and the Firm’s risk management\nframework.\nIn the process of developing business plans and\nstrategic initiatives, LOB and Corporate senior\nmanagement identify the associated risks that are\nincorporated into the Firmwide Risk Identification\nprocess and monitored and assessed as part of the\nFirmwide Risk Appetite framework.\nIn addition, IRM conducts a qualitative assessment of\nthe LOB and Corporate strategic initiatives to assess\ntheir impact on the risk profile of the Firm.\nThe Firm’s strategic planning process, which includes\nthe development and execution of strategic\ninitiatives, is one component of managing the Firm’s\nstrategic risk. Guided by the Firm’s How We Do\nBusiness Principles (the “Principles”) , the Operating\nCommittee and senior management teams in each LOB and\nCorporate review and update the strategic plan\nperiodically. The process includes evaluating the\nhigh-level strategic framework and performance against\nprior-year initiatives, assessing the operating\nenvironment, refining existing strategies and\ndeveloping new strategies.\nThese strategic initiatives, along with IRM’s\nassessment, are incorporated in the Firm’s budget and\nprovided to the Board for review.\nThe Firm’s balance sheet strategy, which focuses on\nrisk-adjusted returns, strong capital and robust\nliquidity, is also a component in the management of\nstrategic risk. Refer to Capital Risk Management on\npages 91-101 for further information on capital risk.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108\nfor further information on liquidity risk. Refer to\nReputation Risk Management on page 109 for further\ninformation on reputation risk.\n90    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nCAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nCapital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient\nlevel or composition of capital to support the Firm’s\nbusiness activities and associated risks during normal\neconomic environments and under stressed conditions.\nA strong capital position is essential to the Firm’s\nbusiness strategy and competitive position.\nMaintaining a strong balance sheet to manage through\neconomic volatility is considered a strategic\nimperative of the Firm’s Board of Directors, CEO and\nOperating Committee. The Firm’s fortress balance sheet\nphilosophy focuses on risk-adjusted returns, strong\ncapital and robust liquidity. The Firm’s capital risk\nmanagement strategy focuses on maintaining long-term\nstability to enable the Firm to build and invest in\nmarket-leading businesses, including in highly\nstressed environments. Senior management considers the\nimplications on the Firm’s capital prior to making any\nsignificant decisions that could impact future\nbusiness activities. In addition to considering the\nFirm’s earnings outlook, senior management evaluates\nall sources and uses of capital with a view to\nensuring the Firm’s capital strength.\nCapital management oversight\nThe Firm has a Capital Management Oversight function\nwhose primary objective is to provide independent\noversight of capital risk across the Firm.\nCapital Management Oversight’s responsibilities\ninclude:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting capital risk\nmetrics;\nEstablishing, calibrating and monitoring capital\nrisk limits and indicators, including capital risk\nappetite;\nDeveloping a process to classify, monitor and report\ncapital limit breaches; and\nPerforming an independent assessment of the Firm’s\ncapital management activities, including changes made\nto the Contingency Capital Plan described below.\nIn addition, the Basel Independent Review function\n(“BIR”), which is a part of the IRM function, conducts\nindependent assessments of the Firm’s regulatory\ncapital framework. These assessments are intended to\nensure compliance with the applicable regulatory\ncapital rules in support of senior management’s\nresponsibility for managing capital and for the Board\nRisk Committee’s oversight of management in executing\nthat responsibility.\nCapital management\nTreasury & CIO is responsible for capital management.\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s capital\nmanagement are to:\nMaintain sufficient capital in order to continue to\nbuild and invest in the Firm’s businesses through the\ncycle and in stressed environments;\nRetain flexibility to take advantage of future\ninvestment opportunities;\nPromote the Firm’s ability to serve as a source of\nstrength to its subsidiaries;\nEnsure the Firm operates above the minimum\nregulatory capital ratios as well as maintain “well-\ncapitalized” status for the Firm and its insured\ndepository institution (“IDI”) subsidiaries at all\ntimes under applicable regulatory capital\nrequirements;\nMeet capital distribution objectives; and\nMaintain sufficient capital resources to operate\nthroughout a resolution period in accordance with the\nFirm’s preferred resolution strategy.\nThe Firm addresses these objectives through\nestablishing internal minimum capital requirements and\na strong capital governance framework. The internal\nminimum capital levels consider the Firm’s regulatory\ncapital requirements as well as an internal assessment\nof capital adequacy, in normal economic cycles and in\nstress events, when setting its minimum capital\nlevels.\nCapital management is intended to be flexible in order\nto react to a range of potential events.\nThe current capital governance framework requires\nregular monitoring of the Firm’s capital position and\nfollows prescribed escalation protocols, both at the\nFirm and material legal entity levels.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for overseeing the Firm’s\ncapital management include the Capital Governance\nCommittee, the Treasurer Committee and the Firmwide\nALCO. Oversight of capital management is governed\nthrough the CIO, Treasury and Corporate (“CTC”) Risk\nCommittee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee\nperiodically reviews the Firm’s capital risk\ntolerance. Refer to Firmwide Risk Management on pages\n85-89 for additional discussion on the Board Risk\nCommittee and the ALCO.\nCapital planning and stress testing\nComprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\nThe Federal Reserve requires large BHCs, including the\nFirm, to submit at least annually a capital plan that\nhas been reviewed and approved by the Board of\nDirectors. The Federal Reserve uses CCAR and other\nstress testing processes to ensure that large BHCs\nhave sufficient capital during periods of economic and\nfinancial stress, and have robust, forward-looking\ncapital assessment and planning processes in place\nthat address each BHC’s unique risks to enable it to\nabsorb losses under certain stress scenarios. Through\nCCAR, the Federal Reserve evaluates each BHC’s capital\nadequacy and internal capital adequacy assessment\nprocesses (“ICAAP”), as well as its plans to make\ncapital distributions, such as dividend payments or\nstock repurchases. The Federal Reserve uses results\nunder the severely adverse scenario from its\nsupervisory stress test to determine each firm’s SCB\nrequirement for the coming\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    91\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nyear. Refer to Key Regulatory Developments on pages\n93–94 for additional information.\nOn June 29, 2020, the Firm announced that it had\ncompleted the 2020 CCAR stress test process. On August\n10, 2020, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's SCB\nrequirement of 3.3% and the Firm's minimum\nStandardized CET1 capital ratio of 11.3% (up from\n10.5%). The SCB requirement became effective on\nOctober 1, 2020.\nIn June 2020, the Federal Reserve determined that\nchanges in financial markets or the macroeconomic\noutlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a\nmaterial effect on a firm’s risk profile and financial\ncondition and therefore required all large bank\nholding companies, including the Firm, to update and\nresubmit their capital plans by November 2, 2020. On\nDecember 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve released its\nresults from the 2020 CCAR Round 2 stress test, which\nshowed that large banks had strong levels of capital\nand announced that it would allow all large banks,\nincluding the Firm, to resume share repurchases\ncommencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to\ncertain restrictions for at least the first quarter of\n2021 given considerable economic uncertainty remained.\nThe Federal Reserve has stated that due to uncertainty\nabout future economic conditions and the ultimate path\nof the current recovery, the SCB will not be reset at\nthis time. The Federal Reserve will notify firms by\nMarch 31, 2021 whether a revised SCB requirement based\non the 2020 CCAR Round 2 stress test will be\nrecalculated ahead of the 2021 annual CCAR assessment.\nRefer to Capital actions on page 99 for information on\nactions taken by the Firm’s Board of Directors\nfollowing the 2020 CCAR results.\nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process\nAnnually, the Firm prepares the ICAAP, which informs\nthe Board of Directors of the ongoing assessment of\nthe Firm’s processes for managing the sources and uses\nof capital as well as compliance with supervisory\nexpectations for capital planning and capital\nadequacy. The Firm’s ICAAP integrates stress testing\nprotocols with capital planning.\nThe CCAR and other stress testing processes assess the\npotential impact of alternative economic and business\nscenarios on the Firm’s earnings and capital. Economic\nscenarios, and the parameters underlying those\nscenarios, are defined centrally and applied uniformly\nacross the businesses. These scenarios are articulated\nin terms of macroeconomic factors, which are key\ndrivers of business results; global market shocks,\nwhich generate short-term but severe trading losses;\nand idiosyncratic operational risk events. The\nscenarios are intended to capture and stress key\nvulnerabilities and idiosyncratic risks facing the\nFirm. However, when defining a broad range of\nscenarios, actual events can be worse. Accordingly,\nmanagement considers additional stresses outside these\nscenarios, as necessary. These results are reviewed by\nmanagement and the Board of Directors.\nContingency capital plan\nThe Firm’s contingency capital plan establishes the\ncapital management framework for the Firm and\nspecifies the principles underlying the Firm’s\napproach towards capital management in normal economic\nconditions and during stress. The contingency capital\nplan defines how the Firm calibrates its targeted\ncapital levels and meets minimum capital requirements,\nmonitors the ongoing appropriateness of planned\ncapital distributions, and sets out the capital\ncontingency actions that are expected to be taken or\nconsidered at various levels of capital depletion\nduring a period of stress.\nRegulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,\nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company. The OCC\nestablishes similar minimum capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm’s IDI subsidiaries, including\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The U.S. capital\nrequirements generally follow the Capital Accord of\nthe Basel Committee, as amended from time to time.\nBasel III Overview\nThe capital rules under Basel III establish minimum\ncapital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards\nfor large and internationally active U.S. BHCs and\nbanks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount\nof regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and\nbanks is determined by calculating risk-weighted\nassets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet assets and\noff-balance sheet exposures, weighted according to\nrisk. Two comprehensive approaches are prescribed for\ncalculating RWA: a standardized approach (“Basel III\nStandardized”), and an advanced approach (“Basel III\nAdvanced”). For each of the risk-based capital ratios,\nthe capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against\nthe lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective minimum capital ratios.\nBasel III establishes capital requirements for\ncalculating credit risk RWA and market risk RWA, and\nin the case of Basel III Advanced, operational risk\nRWA. Key differences in the calculation of credit risk\nRWA between the Standardized and Advanced approaches\nare that for Basel III Advanced, credit risk RWA is\nbased on risk-sensitive approaches which largely rely\non the use of internal credit models and parameters,\nwhereas for Basel III Standardized, credit risk RWA is\ngenerally based on supervisory risk-weightings which\nvary primarily by counterparty type and asset class.\nMarket risk RWA is calculated on a generally\nconsistent basis between Basel III Standardized and\nBasel III Advanced. In addition to the RWA calculated\nunder these approaches, the Firm may supplement such\namounts to incorporate management judgment and\nfeedback from its regulators.\nBasel III also includes a requirement for Advanced\nApproach banking organizations, including the Firm, to\n92    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\ncalculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 98 for\nadditional information.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe Firm has been impacted by market events as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic, but remains well-\ncapitalized. However, the continuation or further\ndeterioration of the current macroeconomic environment\ncould result in impacts to the Firm’s capital and\nleverage.\nKey Regulatory Developments\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses. Effective January 1,\n2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments –\nCredit Losses guidance under U.S. GAAP. As permitted\nunder the U.S. capital rules issued by the federal\nbanking agencies in 2019, the Firm initially elected\nto phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL\nadoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion\nto CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to\n2023. As part of their response to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued\nas final on August 26, 2020) that provided the option\nto delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for\ntwo years, followed by a three-year transition period\n(“CECL capital transition provisions”).\nThe final rule provides a uniform approach for\nestimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy\nincurred loss model during the first two years of the\ntransition period (the “day 2” transition amount),\nwhereby the Firm may exclude from CET1 capital 25% of\nthe change in the allowance for credit losses\n(excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative\nday 2 transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that\nis not recognized in CET1 capital, as well as the $2.7\nbillion day 1 impact, will be phased into CET1 capital\nat 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. The Firm\nhas elected to apply the CECL capital transition\nprovisions, and accordingly, for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020, the capital metrics of the Firm\nexclude $5.7 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1\nimpact to retained earnings and 25% of the $12.2\nbillion increase in the allowance for credit losses\n(excluding allowances on PCD loans).\nThe impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions\nhave also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital,\nadjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure.\nRefer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL\naccounting guidance.\nMoney Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility (\"MMLF\") .\nThe Federal Reserve established the MMLF facility on\nMarch 18, 2020, authorized through at least March 31,\n2021, to enhance the liquidity and functioning of\nmoney markets. Under the MMLF, the Federal Reserve\nBank of Boston (“FRBB”) makes nonrecourse advances to\nparticipating financial institutions to purchase\ncertain types of assets from eligible money market\nmutual fund clients. These assets, which are reflected\nin other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance\nsheets, are pledged to the FRBB as collateral. On\nMarch 23, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an\ninterim final rule (issued as final on\nSeptember 29, 2020) to neutralize the effects of\npurchasing assets through the program on risk-based\nand leverage-based capital ratios. As of December 31,\n2020, the Firm excluded assets purchased from money\nmarket mutual fund clients pursuant to nonrecourse\nadvances provided under the MMLF in the amount of $187\nmillion from its RWA and $358 million from adjusted\nthree month average assets and total leverage\nexposure.\nSupplementary leverage ratio temporary revision. On\nApril 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim\nfinal rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the\ncalculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of\ncalculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to\nexclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.\nThese exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and\nwill remain in effect through March 31, 2021.\nOn June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC\nissued an interim final rule that provides IDI\nsubsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary\nexclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has not\nelected to apply this exclusion.\nPaycheck Protection Program. On April 13, 2020, the\nfederal banking agencies issued an interim final rule\n(issued as final on September 29, 2020) to neutralize\nthe regulatory capital effects of participating in the\nPPP on risk-based capital ratios by applying a zero\npercent risk weight to loans originated under the\nprogram. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the\nSBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material\ncredit losses on these loans. As of December 31, 2020,\nthe Firm had approximately $27 billion of loans under\nthe program.\nThe rule also provides that if a PPP loan is pledged\nas collateral for a non-recourse loan under the\nFederal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending\n(“PPPL”) Facility, the PPP loan can be excluded from\nleverage-based capital ratios. As of December 31,\n2020, the Firm had not participated in the PPPL\nFacility.\nRefer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the\nCOVID-19 Pandemic on pages 52-53 for additional\ninformation on regulatory actions and significant\nfinancing programs that the U.S. government and\nregulators have introduced to address the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic.\nStress Capital Buffer. On March 4, 2020, the Federal\nReserve issued the final rule introducing the SCB\nframework for the Basel III Standardized approach that\nis designed to more closely integrate the results of\nthe quantitative assessment in the annual CCAR with\nthe ongoing minimum capital requirements for BHCs\nunder the U.S. Basel III rules. The final rule\nreplaces the fixed 2.5% CET1 capital conservation\nbuffer in the Standardized approach with a dynamic\ninstitution-specific SCB. The final rule does not\napply to the U.S. Basel III Advanced approach capital\nrequirements. The SCB requirement for BHCs will be\neffective on October 1 of each year and is expected to\nremain in effect until September 30 of the following\nyear.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    93\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nTLAC Holdings rule. On October 20, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the\nregulatory capital treatment for holdings of TLAC debt\ninstruments by certain large banking organizations,\nsuch as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This\nrule expands the scope of the existing capital\ndeductions rule around the\nholdings of capital instruments of financial\ninstitutions to also include TLAC debt instruments\nissued by systemically important banking\norganizations. The final rule will become effective on\nApril 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material\nimpact on the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics.\nRisk-based Capital Regulatory Minimums\nThe following chart presents the Firm’s Basel III\nminimum CET1 capital ratio under the Basel III rules\ncurrently in effect.\nThe Firm’s Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios\nare currently more binding than the Basel III Advanced\nrisk-based ratios.\nAll banking institutions are currently required to\nhave a minimum CET1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-\nweighted assets.\nCertain banking organizations, including the Firm, are\nrequired to hold additional levels of capital to serve\nas a “capital conservation buffer”. The capital\nconservation buffer incorporates a global systemically\nimportant bank (“GSIB”) surcharge, a discretionary\ncountercyclical capital buffer and a fixed capital\nconservation buffer of 2.5% for Advanced regulatory\ncapital requirements and a variable SCB requirement,\nfloored at 2.5%, for Standardized regulatory capital\nrequirements.\nUnder the Federal Reserve’s GSIB rule, the Firm is\nrequired to assess its GSIB surcharge on an annual\nbasis under two separately prescribed methods based on\ndata for the previous fiscal year-end, and is subject\nto the higher of the two. The first (“Method 1”),\nreflects the GSIB surcharge as prescribed by the Basel\nCommittee’s assessment methodology, and is calculated\nacross five criteria: size, cross-jurisdictional\nactivity, interconnectedness, complexity and\nsubstitutability. The second (“Method 2”), modifies\nthe Method 1 requirements to include a measure of\nshort-term wholesale funding in place of\nsubstitutability, and introduces a GSIB score\n“multiplication factor”.\n94    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents the Firm’s effective GSIB\nsurcharge for the years ended December 31, 2020 and\n2019.\n2020          2019\nFully Phased-In:\nMethod 1            2.50     %    2.50     %\nMethod 2            3.50     %    3.50     %\nThe Firm’s effective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge calculated under Method 2 remains unchanged at 3.5% for\n2021. On November 11, 2020, the Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) released its annual GSIB list, which published\nthe Firm’s Method 1 GSIB surcharge of 2.0% (down from 2.5%) effective January 1, 2021, based upon data as of\nDecember 31, 2019. The Firm’s estimated Method 2 surcharge calculated using data as of December 31, 2020 is 4.0%.\nAccordingly, based on the GSIB rule currently in effect, the Firm’s effective regulatory minimum GSIB surcharge is\nexpected to increase to 4.0% on January 1, 2023 unless the Firm’s Method 2 GSIB surcharge calculation based upon\ndata as of December 31, 2021 is lower. The U.S. federal regulatory capital standards include a framework for\nsetting a discretionary countercyclical capital buffer taking into account the macro financial environment in which\nlarge, internationally active banks function. As of December 31, 2020, the U.S. countercyclical capital buffer\nremained at 0%. The Federal Reserve will continue to review the buffer at least annually. The buffer can be\nincreased if the Federal Reserve, FDIC and OCC determine that systemic risks are meaningfully above normal and can\nbe calibrated up to an additional 2.5% of RWA subject to a 12-month implementation period. Failure to maintain\nregulatory capital equal to or in excess of the risk-based regulatory capital minimum plus the capital conservation\nbuffer (inclusive of the GSIB surcharge) and any countercyclical buffer will result in limitations to the amount of\ncapital that the Firm may distribute, such as through dividends and common share repurchases, as well as certain\nexecutive discretionary bonus payments. The Firm has a target Basel III CET1 capital ratio of 12%. However, the\nFirm may remain above that level in order to satisfy leverage-based capital requirements if deposits continue to\ngrow due to actions taken by the Federal Reserve and the U.S. government in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB top-tier holding companies,\nincluding the Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”). Refer\nto TLAC on page 100 for additional information. Leverage-based Capital Regulatory Minimums Supplementary leverage\nratio Banking organizations subject to the Basel III Advanced approach are currently required to have a minimum SLR\nof\n3.0%. Certain banking organizations, including the Firm, are also required to hold an additional 2.0% leverage\nbuffer. The SLR is defined as Tier 1 capital under Basel III divided by the Firm’s total leverage exposure. Total\nleverage exposure is calculated by taking the Firm’s total average on-balance sheet assets, less amounts permitted\nto be deducted for Tier 1 capital, and adding certain off-balance sheet exposures, such as undrawn commitments and\nderivatives potential future exposure. Failure to maintain an SLR equal to or greater than the regulatory minimum\nwill result in limitations on the amount of capital that the Firm may distribute such as through dividends and\ncommon share repurchases. Other regulatory capital In addition to meeting the capital ratio requirements of Basel\nIII, the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries also must maintain minimum capital and leverage ratios in order to be “well-\ncapitalized” under the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve and the Prompt Corrective Action (“PCA”)\nrequirements of the FDIC Improvement Act (“FDICIA”), respectively. Refer to Note 27 for additional information.\nAdditional information regarding the Firm’s capital ratios, as well as the U.S. federal regulatory capital\nstandards to which the Firm is subject, is presented in Note 27. Refer to the Firm’s Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s website, for further information on the Firm’s Basel III\nmeasures.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    95\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe following table presents the Firm’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel III\nStandardized and Advanced approaches.\n(in           Standar…                                              Advanced\nmillio…       December                            Minimum           December          Decemb…        Minimum\nexcept             31,           December         capital                31,              31,        capital\nratios)       2020(c)…           31, 2019        ratios(…           2020(c)…             2019       ratios(…\nRisk-b…\ncapital\nmetric…\nCET1       $   205,078        $   187,753                        $   205,078       $  187,753\ncapital\nTier 1         234,844            214,432                            234,844          214,432\ncapital\nTotal          269,923            242,589                            257,228          232,112\ncapital\nRisk-w…       1,560,6…           1,515,8…                           1,484,4…          1,397,…\nassets\nCET1\ncapital           13.1  %            12.4  %         11.3  %            13.8  %          13.4  %        10.5  %\nratio\nTier 1\ncapital           15.0               14.1            12.8               15.8             15.3           12.0\nratio\nTotal\ncapital           17.3               16.0            14.8               17.3             16.6           14.0\nratio\nLevera…\ncapital\nmetric…\nAdjust…\naverage    $  3,353,3…        $  2,730,2…                        $  3,353,3…       $  2,730,…\nassets…\nTier 1\nlevera…            7.0  %             7.9  %          4.0  %             7.0  %           7.9  %         4.0  %\nratio\nTotal\nlevera…                 NA                 NA                    $  3,401,5…       $  3,423,…\nexposu…\nSLR(b)                  NA                 NA              NA            6.9  %           6.3  %         5.0  %\n(a) Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the leverage ratios, includes total quarterly average\nassets adjusted for on-balance sheet assets that are subject to deduction from Tier 1 capital, predominantly\ngoodwill and other intangible assets.\n(b) As of December 31, 2020, total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR excludes U.S. Treasury\nsecurities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, as provided by the interim final rule issued by the Federal\nReserve on April 1, 2020.\n(c) As of December 31, 2020, the capital metrics reflect the CECL capital transition provisions.\n(d) As of December 31, 2020, the capital metrics reflect the exclusion of assets purchased from money market mutual\nfund clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF.

Liquidity Risk Oversight’s\nresponsibilities include:\nDefining, monitoring and reporting liquidity risk\nmetrics;\nEstablishing and monitoring limits and indicators,\nincluding liquidity risk appetite;\nDeveloping a process to classify, monitor and report\nlimit breaches;\nPerforming an independent review of liquidity risk\nmanagement processes;\nMonitoring and reporting internal Firmwide and legal\nentity liquidity stress tests as well as regulatory\ndefined liquidity stress tests;\nApproving or escalating for review new or updated\nliquidity stress assumptions; and\nMonitoring liquidity positions, balance sheet\nvariances and funding activities;\nLiquidity management\nThe primary objectives of the Firm’s liquidity\nmanagement are to:\nEnsure that the Firm’s core businesses and material\nlegal entities are able to operate in support of\nclient needs and meet contractual and contingent\nfinancial obligations through normal economic cycles\nas well as during stress events, and\nManage an optimal funding mix and availability of\nliquidity sources.\nAs part of the Firm’s overall liquidity management\nstrategy, the Firm manages liquidity and funding using\na centralized, global approach in order to:\nOptimize liquidity sources and uses;\nMonitor exposures;\nIdentify constraints on the transfer of liquidity\nbetween the Firm’s legal entities; and\nMaintain the appropriate amount of surplus liquidity\nat a Firmwide and legal entity level, where relevant.\nIn the context of the Firm’s liquidity management,\nTreasury and CIO is responsible for:\nAnalyzing and understanding the liquidity\ncharacteristics of the assets and liabilities of the\nFirm, LOBs and legal entities, taking into account\nlegal, regulatory, and operational restrictions;\nDeveloping internal liquidity stress testing\nassumptions;\nDefining and monitoring Firmwide and legal entity-\nspecific liquidity strategies, policies, reporting and\ncontingency funding plans;\nManaging liquidity within the Firm’s approved\nliquidity risk appetite tolerances and limits;\nManaging compliance with regulatory requirements\nrelated to funding and liquidity risk; and\nSetting transfer pricing in accordance with\nunderlying liquidity characteristics of balance sheet\nassets and liabilities as well as certain off-balance\nsheet items.\nGovernance\nCommittees responsible for liquidity governance\ninclude the Firmwide ALCO as well as LOB and regional\nALCOs, the Treasurer Committee, and the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, the Board Risk Committee\nreviews and recommends to the Board of Directors, for\nformal approval, the Firm’s liquidity risk tolerances,\nliquidity strategy, and liquidity policy. Refer to\nFirmwide Risk Management on pages 85-89 for further\ndiscussion of ALCO and other risk-related committees.\nInternal stress testing\nLiquidity stress tests are intended to ensure that the\nFirm has sufficient liquidity under a variety of\nadverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as\npart of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning.\nStress scenarios are produced for JPMorgan Chase & Co.\n(“Parent Company”) and the Firm’s material legal\nentities on a regular basis, and other stress tests\nare performed in response to specific market events or\nconcerns. Liquidity stress tests assume all of the\nFirm’s contractual financial obligations are met and\ntake into consideration:\nVarying levels of access to unsecured and secured\nfunding markets,\nEstimated non-contractual and contingent cash\noutflows, and\nPotential impediments to the availability and\ntransferability of liquidity between jurisdictions and\nmaterial legal entities such as regulatory, legal or\nother restrictions.\nLiquidity outflow assumptions are modeled across a\nrange of time horizons and currency dimensions and\ncontemplate both market and idiosyncratic stresses.\nResults of stress tests are considered in the\nformulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment\nof its liquidity position. The Parent Company acts as\na source of funding for the Firm through equity and\nlong-term debt issuances, and its intermediate holding\ncompany, JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC (the “IHC”)\nprovides funding support to the ongoing operations of\nthe Parent Company and its subsidiaries. The Firm\nmaintains liquidity at the Parent Company, IHC, and\noperating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply\nwith liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity\nrequirements, and to manage through periods of\n102    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nstress when access to normal funding sources may be\ndisrupted. Contingency funding plan The Firm’s\nContingency Funding Plan (“CFP”) sets out the\nstrategies for addressing and managing liquidity\nresource needs during a liquidity stress event and\nincorporates liquidity risk limits, indicators and\nrisk appetite tolerances that make up Liquidity\nEscalation Points. The CFP also identifies the\nalternative contingent funding and liquidity resources\navailable to the Firm and its legal entities in a\nperiod of stress. Liquidity Coverage Ratio The LCR\nrule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is\nsufficient to meet its estimated total net cash\noutflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of\nsignificant stress. Eligible HQLA, for purposes of\ncalculating the LCR, is the amount of unencumbered\nHQLA that satisfy certain operational considerations\nas defined in the LCR rule. HQLA primarily consist of\ncash and certain high-quality liquid securities as\ndefined in the LCR rule. Under the LCR rule, the\namount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum\nLCR requirement, and that is not transferable to non-\nbank affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s\nreported eligible HQLA. Estimated net cash outflows\nare based on standardized stress outflow and inflow\nrates prescribed in the LCR rule, which are applied to\nthe balances of the Firm’s assets, sources of funds,\nand obligations. The LCR for both the Firm and\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum\nof 100%.\nThe following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months\nended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020 and\nDecember 31, 2019 based on the Firm’s interpretation\nof the LCR framework.\nAverage amount                    Three months ended                                  December 31,\n(in millions)                      December 31, 2020        September 30, 2020                2019\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nEligible HQLA\nEligible cash(a)               $             455,612     $             458,336     $       203,296\nEligible securities(b)(c)                    241,447                   211,841             341,990\nTotal eligible HQLA(d)         $             697,059     $             670,177     $       545,286\nNet cash outflows              $             634,037     $             587,811     $       469,402\nLCR                                              110  %                    114  %              116  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA(d)    $              63,022     $              82,366     $        75,884\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.:\nLCR                                              160  %                    157  %              116  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA       $             401,903     $             366,096     $        79,483\n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks,\nprimarily the Federal Reserve Banks.

The Firm’s average LCR decreased during\nthe three months ended December 31, 2020, compared\nwith the three-month period ended September 30, 2020,\npredominantly driven by a decrease in cash from long-\nterm debt maturities, including the early termination\nof certain of the Firm's debt at the end of the third\nquarter 2020. The Firm's average LCR decreased during\nthe three months ended December 31, 2020, compared\nwith the prior year period primarily due to the\nrelative impact on net cash outflows from the\nsignificant increase in deposits as well as elevated\nmarket activities in the CIB. JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A.’s average LCR increased during the three months\nended December 31, 2020, compared with both the three\nmonth periods ended September 30, 2020 and December\n31, 2019 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits\ncontinued to increase in the fourth quarter primarily\ndriven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effect\nof certain government actions. The increase in excess\nliquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded\nfrom the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule. The\nFirm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period,\ndue to changes in its eligible HQLA and estimated net\ncash outflows as a result of ongoing business\nactivity. Refer to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure\nreports, which are available on the Firm’s website for\na further discussion of the Firm’s LCR.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    103\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nOther liquidity sources\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s\neligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered\nmarketable securities, such as equity and debt\nsecurities, that the Firm believes would be available\nto raise liquidity. This includes securities included\nas part of the excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates. The fair value of these securities was\napproximately $740 billion and $315 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, although the\namount of liquidity that could be raised would be\ndependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair\nvalue increased compared to December 31, 2019, due to\nan increase in excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased\ndeposits.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at\nFHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve\nBank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to\nsuch banks of approximately $307 billion and $322\nbillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s\neligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that\nare currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank\ndiscount window and other central banks. Available\nborrowing capacity decreased from December 31, 2019\nprimarily due to lower pledged credit card receivable\nbalances driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and a\ndecrease in pledged mortgage collateral as a result of\npaydown and maturity activity. Although available, the\nFirm does not view this borrowing capacity at the\nFederal Reserve Bank discount window and the other\ncentral banks as a primary source of liquidity.\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banking organizations that is\nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” and\n“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year\nhorizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking\nagencies issued a final NSFR rule under which large\nbanking organizations such as the Firm will be\nrequired to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% on an\nongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become\neffective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be\nrequired to publicly disclose its quarterly average\nNSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.\nAs of December 31, 2020 the Firm estimates that it was\ncompliant with the 100% minimum NSFR based on its\ncurrent understanding of the final rule.\n104    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nFunding\nSources of funds\nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations.\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through\ndiverse sources of funding including stable deposits,\nsecured and unsecured funding in the capital markets\nand stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary\nfunding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nAdditionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also\naccess funding through short- or long-term secured\nborrowings, through the issuance of\nunsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the\nParent Company or the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank\nsubsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term\nunsecured borrowings and short-term secured\nborrowings, primarily securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by\nTreasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term\nliquid investments based on their interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics.\nDeposits\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end and average deposit balances as of and for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nAs of or for the year ended\nDecember 31,                                                                      Average\n(in millions)                                  2020            2019                  2020            2019\nConsumer & Community Banking           $    958,706    $    723,418    -a    $    851,390    $    698,378    -a\nCorporate & Investment Bank                 702,215         511,905    -a         655,095         515,938    -a\nCommercial Banking                          284,263         184,115               237,645         172,666\nAsset & Wealth Management                   198,755         142,740    -a         161,955         135,265    -a\nCorporate                                       318             253                   666             820\nTotal Firm                             $  2,144,257    $  1,562,431          $  1,906,751    $  1,523,067\n(a) In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm realigned\ncertain wealth management clients from AWM to the J.P.\nMorgan Wealth Management business unit within CCB. In\nthe first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services\nbusiness was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the\nFirm’s Wholesale Payments business. Prior-period\namounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\nDeposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce\nthe Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets.\nA significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are\nconsumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits,\nwhich are both considered to be stable sources of\nliquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered\nto be stable sources of liquidity because they are\ngenerated from customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm.

However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. Average\ndeposits increased for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily\ndriven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effect of certain government actions. In the\nwholesale businesses, while the inflows principally occurred in March as clients sought to remain liquid as a\nresult of market conditions, balances continued to increase through the end of 2020. In CCB, the increase was\ndriven by lower spending and higher cash balances across both consumer and small business customers, as well as\ngrowth from existing and new accounts.

These instruments are\nsecured predominantly by high-quality securities\ncollateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.\nGSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase increased at December 31,\n2020, compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting\nhigher secured financing of AFS investment securities\nin Treasury and CIO, as well as trading assets in CIB,\npartially offset by a decline in client-driven market-\nmaking activities in CIB, including the Firm's non-\nparticipation in the Federal Reserve's open market\noperations.\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due\nto investment and financing activities of clients, the\nFirm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its\nsecured and unsecured financing (for both the\ninvestment securities and market-making portfolios),\nand other market and portfolio factors.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Firm participated in the\nMMLF government facility.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages\n91-101 for additional information on the MMLF.\nThe Primary Dealer Credit Facility (\"PDCF\") was\nestablished by the Federal Reserve on March 20, 2020.\nUnder the PDCF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\n(“FRBNY”) provides collateralized financing on a term\nbasis to primary dealers. These financing transactions\nwere reported as securities sold under agreements to\nrepurchase. The Firm participated in the PDCF in the\nfirst quarter of 2020, and ceased its participation in\nMay 2020 as the secured financing market normalized.\nThe Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding\nconsist of other borrowed funds and issuance of\nwholesale commercial paper. The decrease in short-term\nunsecured funding at December 31, 2020, from December\n31, 2019 and for the average year ended December 31,\n2020 compared to the prior year period, was due to\nlower net commercial paper issuance primarily for\nshort-term liquidity management.\n106    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nLong-term funding and issuance\nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory\nrequirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market\naccess and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating\nits optimal long-term funding plan.\nThe significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide\nflexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances\nsubstantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external\ncounterparties.

Reductions in these ratings could\nhave an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to\nliquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger\nadditional collateral or funding requirements and\ndecrease the number of investors and counterparties\nwilling to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude\nof the impact of ratings downgrades depends on\nnumerous contractual and behavioral factors,\nwhich the Firm believes are incorporated in its\nliquidity risk and stress testing metrics. The Firm\nbelieves that it maintains sufficient liquidity to\nwithstand a potential decrease in funding capacity due\nto ratings downgrades.\nAdditionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs\nand other third-party commitments may be adversely\naffected by a decline in credit ratings.\nThe credit ratings of the Parent Company and the\nFirm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of\nDecember 31, 2020 were as follows:\nJ.P.\nMorgan\nSecuri…\nLLC\nJPMorgan                           J.P.\nJPMorgan                           Chase                              Morgan\nChase &                            Bank,                              Securi…\nDecemb…    Co.

Rating agencies continue to evaluate economic\nand geopolitical trends, regulatory developments,\nfuture profitability, risk management practices, and\nlitigation matters, as well as their broader ratings\nmethodologies. Changes in any of these factors could\nlead to changes in the Firm’s credit ratings.\n108    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nREPUTATION RISK MANAGEMENT\nReputation risk is the risk that an action or inaction\nmay negatively impact perception of the Firm’s\nintegrity and reduce confidence in the Firm’s\ncompetence by various constituents, including clients,\ncounterparties, customers, investors, regulators,\nemployees, communities or the broader public.\nOrganization and management\nReputation Risk Management establishes the governance\nframework for managing reputation risk across the\nFirm. As reputation risk is inherently challenging to\nidentify, manage, and quantify, a reputation risk\nmanagement function is critical.\nThe Firm’s reputation risk management function\nincludes the following activities:\nMaintaining a Firmwide Reputation Risk Governance\npolicy and standards consistent with the reputation\nrisk framework\nManaging the governance infrastructure and processes\nthat support consistent identification, escalation,\nmanagement and monitoring of reputation risk issues\nFirmwide\nProviding guidance to LOB Reputation Risk Offices\n(“RRO”), as appropriate\nThe types of events that give rise to reputation risk\nare wide-ranging and could be introduced in various\nways, including by the Firm’s employees and the\nclients, customers and counterparties the Firm does\nbusiness with. These events could result in financial\nlosses, litigation and regulatory fines, as well as\nother damages to the Firm.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Reputation Risk Governance policy establishes the\nprinciples for managing reputation risk for the Firm.\nIt is the responsibility of employees in each LOB and\nCorporate to consider the reputation of the Firm when\ndeciding whether to offer a new product, engage in a\ntransaction or client relationship, enter a new\njurisdiction, initiate a business process or other\nmatters. Sustainability, social responsibility and\nenvironmental impacts are important considerations in\nassessing the Firm’s reputation risk, and are a\ncomponent of the Firm’s reputation risk governance.\nReputation risk issues deemed material are escalated\nas appropriate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    109\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT\nCredit and investment risk is the risk associated with\nthe default or change in credit profile of a client,\ncounterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a\nreduction in expected returns on investments,\nincluding consumer credit risk, wholesale credit risk,\nand investment portfolio risk.\nCredit risk management\nCredit risk is the risk associated with the default or\nchange in credit profile of a client, counterparty or\ncustomer. The Firm provides credit to a variety of\ncustomers, ranging from large corporate and\ninstitutional clients to individual consumers and\nsmall businesses. In its consumer businesses, the Firm\nis exposed to credit risk primarily through its home\nlending, credit card, auto, and business banking\nbusinesses. In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is\nexposed to credit risk through its underwriting,\nlending, market-making, and hedging activities with\nand for clients and counterparties, as well as through\nits operating services activities (such as cash\nmanagement and clearing activities), and securities\nfinancing activities. The Firm is also exposed to\ncredit risk through its investment securities\nportfolio and cash placed with banks.\nCredit Risk Management monitors, measures and manages\ncredit risk throughout the Firm and defines credit\nrisk policies and procedures. The Firm’s credit risk\nmanagement governance includes the following\nactivities:\nMaintaining a credit risk policy framework\nMonitoring, measuring and managing credit risk\nacross all portfolio segments, including transaction\nand exposure approval\nSetting industry and geographic concentration\nlimits, as appropriate, and establishing underwriting\nguidelines\nAssigning and managing credit authorities in\nconnection with the approval of credit exposure\nManaging criticized exposures and delinquent loans\nand\nEstimating credit losses and ensuring appropriate\ncredit risk-based capital management\nRisk identification and measurement\nThe Credit Risk Management function monitors,\nmeasures, manages and limits credit risk across the\nFirm’s businesses. To measure credit risk, the Firm\nemploys several methodologies for estimating the\nlikelihood of obligor or counterparty default.\nMethodologies for measuring credit risk vary depending\non several factors, including type of asset (e.g.,\nconsumer versus wholesale), risk measurement\nparameters (e.g., delinquency status and borrower’s\ncredit score versus wholesale risk-rating) and risk\nmanagement and collection processes (e.g., retail\ncollection center versus centrally managed workout\ngroups). Credit risk measurement is based on the\nprobability of default of an obligor or counterparty,\nthe loss severity given a default event and the\nexposure at default.\nBased on these factors and the methodology and\nestimates described in Note 13 and Note 10, the Firm\nestimates credit losses for its exposures. The\nallowance for loan losses reflects credit losses\nrelated to the consumer and wholesale held-for-\ninvestment loan portfolios, the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments reflects credit losses related to\nthe Firm’s lending-related commitments and the\nallowance for investment securities reflects the\ncredit losses related to the Firm’s HTM and AFS\nsecurities. Refer to Note 13, Note 10 and Critical\nAccounting Estimates used by the Firm on pages 152-155\nfor further information.\nIn addition, potential and unexpected credit losses\nare reflected in the allocation of credit risk capital\nand represent the potential volatility of actual\nlosses relative to the established allowances for loan\nlosses and lending-related commitments. The analyses\nfor these losses include stress testing that considers\nalternative economic scenarios as described in the\nStress testing section below.\nStress testing\nStress testing is important in measuring and managing\ncredit risk in the Firm’s credit portfolio. The stress\ntesting process assesses the potential impact of\nalternative economic and business scenarios on\nestimated credit losses for the Firm. Economic\nscenarios and the underlying parameters are defined\ncentrally, articulated in terms of macroeconomic\nfactors and applied across the businesses. The stress\ntest results may indicate credit migration, changes in\ndelinquency trends and potential losses in the credit\nportfolio. In addition to the periodic stress testing\nprocesses, management also considers additional\nstresses outside these scenarios, including industry\nand country- specific stress scenarios, as necessary.\nThe Firm uses stress testing to inform decisions on\nsetting risk appetite both at a Firm and LOB level, as\nwell as to assess the impact of stress on individual\ncounterparties.\n110    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nRisk monitoring and management\nThe Firm has developed policies and practices that are\ndesigned to preserve the independence and integrity of\nthe approval and decision-making process of extending\ncredit to ensure credit risks are assessed accurately,\napproved properly, monitored regularly and managed\nactively at both the transaction and portfolio levels.\nThe policy framework establishes credit approval\nauthorities, concentration limits, risk-rating\nmethodologies, portfolio review parameters and\nguidelines for management of distressed exposures. In\naddition, certain models, assumptions and inputs used\nin evaluating and monitoring credit risk are\nindependently validated by groups that are separate\nfrom the LOBs.\nConsumer credit risk is monitored for delinquency and\nother trends, including any concentrations at the\nportfolio level, as certain of these trends can be\nmodified through changes in underwriting policies and\nportfolio guidelines. Consumer Risk Management\nevaluates delinquency and other trends against\nbusiness expectations, current and forecasted economic\nconditions, and industry benchmarks. Historical and\nforecasted economic performance and trends are\nincorporated into the modeling of estimated consumer\ncredit losses and are part of the monitoring of the\ncredit risk profile of the portfolio.\nWholesale credit risk is monitored regularly at an\naggregate portfolio, industry, and individual client\nand counterparty level with established concentration\nlimits that are reviewed and revised periodically as\ndeemed appropriate by management. Industry and\ncounterparty limits, as measured in terms of exposure\nand economic risk appetite, are subject to stress-\nbased loss constraints. Wrong-way risk is the risk\nthat exposure to a counterparty is positively\ncorrelated with the impact of a default by the same\ncounterparty, which could cause exposure to increase\nat the same time as the counterparty’s capacity to\nmeet its obligations is decreasing.\nManagement of the Firm’s wholesale credit risk\nexposure is accomplished through a number of means,\nincluding:\nLoan underwriting and credit approval process\nLoan syndications and participations\nLoan sales and securitizations\nCredit derivatives\nMaster netting agreements, and\nCollateral and other risk-reduction techniques\nIn addition to Credit Risk Management, an independent\nCredit Review function is responsible for:\nI ndependently validating or changing the risk\ngrades assigned to exposures in the Firm’s wholesale\ncredit portfolio, and assessing the timeliness of risk\ngrade changes initiated by responsible business units;\nand\nEvaluating the effectiveness of business units’\ncredit management processes, including the adequacy of\ncredit analyses and risk grading/LGD rationales,\nproper monitoring and management of credit exposures,\nand compliance with applicable grading policies and\nunderwriting guidelines.\nRefer to Note 12 for further discussion of consumer\nand wholesale loans.\nRisk reporting\nTo enable monitoring of credit risk and effective\ndecision-making, aggregate credit exposure, credit\nquality forecasts, concentration levels and risk\nprofile changes are reported regularly to senior\nmembers of Credit Risk Management. Detailed portfolio\nreporting of industry, clients, counterparties and\ncustomers, product and geography are prepared, and the\nappropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is\nreviewed by senior management at least on a quarterly\nbasis. Through the risk reporting and governance\nstructure, credit risk trends and limit exceptions are\nprovided regularly to, and discussed with, risk\ncommittees, senior management and the Board of\nDirectors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    111\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCREDIT PORTFOLIO\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL\naccounting guidance. The adoption resulted in a change\nin the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered\nPCD loans under CECL. In conjunction with the adoption\nof CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and\nlending-related commitments from the consumer,\nexcluding credit card portfolio segment to the\nwholesale portfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining the allowance.\nPrior-period amounts have been revised to conform with\nthe current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further\ninformation.\nThe Firm has provided various forms of assistance to\ncustomers and clients impacted by the COVID-19\npandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant\nmodifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19\nrelated loan modifications have not been considered\ntroubled debt restructurings (“TDRs”) because:\nthey represent short-term or other insignificant\nmodifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan\nmodification assessments or the IA Statement guidance,\nor\nthe Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend\nthe application of accounting guidance for TDRs\nprovided by the CARES Act and extended by the\nConsolidated Appropriations Act.\nTo the extent that certain modifications do not meet\nany of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them\nas TDRs. The Firm considers expected losses of\nprincipal and accrued interest associated with all\nCOVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance\nfor credit losses. Refer to Business Developments on\npages 50-51 for more information on customer and\nclient assistance granted. Refer to Notes 12 and 13\nfor further information on the Firm’s accounting\npolicies on loan modifications and the allowance for\ncredit losses.\nThe effectiveness of the Firm’s actions in helping\nborrowers recover and in mitigating the Firm’s credit\nlosses remains uncertain in light of the unpredictable\nnature and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAssistance provided in response to the COVID-19\npandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies,\nnonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those\ncustomers and clients who would have otherwise moved\ninto past due or nonaccrual status.

These amounts have been\nexcluded based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card\nloans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance. (g) At December 31, 2020,\nnonperforming loans included $ 1.6billion of PCD loans on nonaccrual status. Prior to the adoption of CECL,\nnonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the\npools was performing.\nPaycheck Protection Program The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented by the SBA, provided the Firm\nwith delegated authority to process and originate PPP loans. When certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject\nto forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the forgiveness amount from the SBA. PPP loans have a\ncontractual term of two or five years and provide borrowers with an automatic payment deferral of principal and\ninterest. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit\nlosses on these loans. PPP processing fees are deferred and accreted into interest income over the contractual life\nof the loans, but may be accelerated upon forgiveness or prepayment. The impact on interest income related to PPP\nloans was not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. The Firm was in the early stages of the PPP loan\nforgiveness process at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2020, the Firm had approximately $27 billion of loans\nunder the PPP, of which $19 billion are in the consumer portfolio and $8 billion are in the wholesale portfolio.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    113\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO\nThe Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists\nprimarily of residential real estate loans, credit card\nloans, scored auto and business banking loans, as well\nas associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s\nfocus is on serving primarily the prime segment of the\nconsumer credit market. Originated mortgage loans are\nretained in the residential real estate portfolio,\nsecuritized or sold to U.S. government agencies and\nU.S. government-sponsored enterprises; other types of\nconsumer loans are typically retained on the balance\nsheet. Refer to Note 12 for further information on the\nconsumer loan portfolio. Refer to Note 28 for further\ninformation on lending-related commitments.\nIn 2020, the allowance for credit losses increased,\nreflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty around\nthe future macroeconomic environment as a result of the\nimpact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Net charge-offs for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 decreased when\ncompared to December 31, 2019, benefiting from payment\nassistance and government stimulus. The potential for\nincreased infection rates and related lock downs, as\nwell as the duration and effectiveness of government\nand other consumer relief measures remains uncertain\nwhich could have a longer term impact on delinquency\nrates and net charge-offs.\n114    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the scored credit portfolio held\nin CCB, AWM, CIB and Corpora te.\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…                                                                                           …\n…                                     N…                           N…                       …\n…       C…                            l…                           c…                       …\n…       e…    2…             2…       2…                   …       2…                 2…    …        …\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  2…          $  2…          $  5…      $  2…             $  -…     $  -…             …  %          -…  %\n…\n…\n…       7…             5…             1…      $  1…                3…     $  4…             …        …    0…\n…\n…\n…       3…             2…             5…         2…                1…        3…             …             0…\n-\n…\n…       1…             3…              —          2                    …         …             NA             …\n…\n…\n…       1…             1…             1…         4…                    …         …             NA             …\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…       3…             3…             6…         3…                1…        3…             …             0…\n…\n…\n…\n…       5…             4…\n…\n…\n…\n…       3…             3…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…       1…             1…                 NA         NA            4…        4…             …             3…\n…\n…       7…              —                 NA         NA                …         …             NA             …\n…\n…\n…       1…             1…                 NA         NA            4…        4…             …             3…\n…\n…\n…       6…             6…\n…\n…\n…       8…             8…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  1…          $  1…          $  6…      $  3…             $  4…     $  5…             …  %          1…  %\n…\n…\n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in Corporate\n.\n(b) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, excluded operating lease assets of $20.6 billion and $22.8 billion,\nrespectively.

A\nportion of the remaining $6.7 billion of loans could\nbecome TDRs in future periods, depending on the nature\nand timing of further modifications or payment\narrangements offered to these borrowers. If the\nremaining $6.7 billion of loans were considered TDRs,\nthe Firm estimates that it would result in an increase\nin standardized RWA of as much as $2.5 billion.\nPredominantly all borrowers, including those accounted\nfor as TDRs, were current upon enrollment in payment\ndeferral programs and are expected to exit payment\ndeferral programs in a current status, either because\nno payments are contractually due during the deferral\nperiod or because payments originally contractually due\nduring the deferral period will be due at maturity upon\nexit.

The following discussions provide\ninformation concerning individual loan products. Refer\nto Note 12 for further information about this\nportfolio, including information about delinquencies,\nloan modifications and other credit quality\nindicators. Residential real estate: The residential\nreal estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale\nand loans at fair value, predominantly consists of\nprime mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.\nThe portfolio decreased from December 31, 2019 driven\nby paydowns largely offset by originations of prime\nmortgage loans that have been retained on the balance\nsheet. The 30+ delinquency rate decreased to 0.98% at\nDecember 31, 2020, from 1.35% at December 31, 2019,\nprimarily due to payment assistance and government\nstimulus. Nonaccrual loans increased from December 31,\n2019 due primarily to loans placed on nonaccrual\nstatus related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\nas well as the adoption of CECL, as PCD loans became\nsubject to nonaccrual treatment. Net recoveries for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 were higher when\ncompared with the prior year as the current year\nbenefited from a recovery on a loan sale. The carrying\nvalue of home equity lines of credit outstanding was\n$23.7 billion at December 31, 2020. This amount\nincluded $8.6 billion of HELOCs that have recast from\ninterest-only to fully amortizing payments or have\nbeen modified and $7.7 billion of interest-only\nballoon HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The\nFirm manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by closing or reducing the undrawn line to the\nextent permitted by law when borrowers are exhibiting\na material deterioration in their credit risk profile.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying value of\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans were $25.6\nbillion and $22.5 billion, respectively. These loans\nhave an interest-only payment period generally\nfollowed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully\namortizing payment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance loans to\nhigher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The net\ncharge-off rate for the year ended December 31, 2020\nwas consistent with the rate of the broader\nresidential mortgage portfolio as the performance of\nthis portfolio is generally in line with the\nperformance of the broader residential mortgage\nportfolio.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s\nresidential mortgage portfolio insured and/or\nguaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair value.

The\nportfolio increased when compared with December 31,\n2019, predominantly due to PPP loan originations of\n$21.9 billion in Business Banking of which $19.2\nbillion remained outstanding at December 31, 2020 as\nwell as from growth in the auto portfolio from loan\noriginations, partially offset by paydowns and charge-\noffs or liquidation of delinquent loans. The 30+\ndelinquency rate decreased to 0.60% at December 31,\n2020, from 1.31% at December 31, 2019, primarily due\nto payment assistance and government stimulus, as well\nas PPP loan originations as these loans are all\nconsidered current.

The December 31, 2020 30+ and 90+ day\ndelinquency rates of 1.68% and 0.92%, respectively,\ndecreased compared to the December 31, 2019 30+ and\n90+ day delinquency rates of 1.87% and 0.95%,\nrespectively. The delinquency rates were positively\nimpacted by borrowers who received payment assistance\nand government stimulus. Net charge-offs decreased for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the\nprior year reflecting lower charge-offs and higher\nrecoveries primarily benefiting from payment\nassistance and government stimulus.\nConsistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until charged\noff. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses\nincludes the estimated uncollectible portion of\naccrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to\nNote 12 for further information about this portfolio,\nincluding information about delinquencies.\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card loans\nAt December 31, 2020, $65.0 billion, or 45% of the\ntotal retained credit card loan portfolio, was\nconcentrated in California, Texas, New York, Florida\nand Illinois, compared with $77.5 billion, or 46%, at\nDecember 31, 2019. Refer to Note 12 for additional\ninformation on the geographic and FICO composition of\nthe Firm’s credit card loans.\nModifications of credit card loans\nAt December 31, 2020, the Firm had $1.4 billion of\ncredit card loans outstanding that have been modified\nin TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term\nor other insignificant modifications that are not\nconsidered TDRs, compared to $1.5 billion at December\n31, 2019.

A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on\nthe balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as\npart of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale\nportfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.\nRefer to the industry discussion on pages 123-127 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio\nincludes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer\nexposures held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit\nlosses. In 2020, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in broad-based credit deterioration and an increase\nin the allowance for credit losses. As of December 31, 2020, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio\ndecreased from 74% to 71%, and criticized exposure increased $26.5 billion from $15.1 billion to $41.6 billion. The\nincrease in criticized exposure was largely driven by downgrades in Consumer & Retail, Oil & Gas and Real Estate,\nand to a lesser extent, net portfolio activity in Technology, Media & Telecommunications. The continuation or\nworsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment could result in further impacts\nto credit quality metrics, including investment-grade percentages, as well as to criticized and nonperforming\nexposures and charge-offs. As of December 31, 2020 retained loans were up $33.3 billion predominantly driven by AWM\nand CIB, and lending-related commitments were up $32.4 billion, predominantly driven by CIB and CB.\nWholesale credit\nportfolio\nDecember 31,\n(in millions)            Credit exposure                                     Nonperforming(f)\n2020                                2019                          2020                   2019\nLoans retained        $          514,947      $    481,678                $             3,318      $  1,057\nLoans                              5,784             4,062                                284             5\nheld-for-sale\nLoans at fair                     29,327            25,139                                504           209\nvalue(a)\nLoans – reported                 550,058           510,879                              4,106         1,271\nDerivative                        79,630            49,766                                 56            30\nreceivables\nReceivables from                  47,710            33,706                                  —             —\ncustomers(b)\nTotal wholesale\ncredit-related                   677,398           594,351                              4,162         1,301\nassets\nAssets acquired in\nloan satisfactions\nReal estate                               NA                NA                            125           115\nowned(c)\nOther                                     NA                NA                              —            19\nTotalassets\nacquired in loan                          NA                NA                            125           134\nsatisfactions\nLending-related                  449,863           417,510                                577           474\ncommitments(a)\nTotal wholesale       $        1,127,261      $  1,011,861                $             4,864      $  1,909\ncredit portfolio\nCredit derivatives\nused\nin credit             $          -22,239      $    -18,530                $                 —      $      —\nportfolio\nmanagement\nactivities(c)(d)\nLiquid securities\nand other cash\ncollateral held                  -14,806           -13,052                                     NA            NA\nagainst\nderivatives(e)\n(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm\nreclassified certain fair value option elected\nlending-related positions from trading assets to\nloans, which resulted in a corresponding\nreclassification of certain off-balance sheet\ncommitments.

Predominantly all clients that\nexited deferral are current or\nhave paid down their loans, and the Firm has not\nexperienced significant new payment deferral requests.\nThe Firm continues to monitor the credit risk\nassociated with loans subject to deferrals throughout\nthe deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the\nborrowers are required to resume making regularly\nscheduled payments and considers expected losses of\nprincipal and accrued interest on these loans in its\nallowance for credit losses.\n(in\nmillions,\nexcept            December                                            September    June 30,\nratios)           31, 2020                                             30, 2020    2020\nPercent of               IG\ntotal       percentage\nIndustry              Loan       industry          of loan                 Loan                            Loan\nbalance           loan       balance in              balance                         balance\nbalance(a)          payment\ndeferral\nReal         $         550           0.46  %            36  %    $        4,385                  $        5,211\nEstate\nIndividu…\nand                    402           0.37                4                  691                             809\nIndividu…\nEntities\nTranspor…              394           5.99               92                  346                             294\nConsumer                82           0.21                2                  413                             690\n& Retail\nAutomoti…               22           0.13                —                   15                           8,827\nIndustri…               19           0.09                —                   91                             335\nHealthca…                7           0.04                —                  100                             300\nAll Other              147           0.08               99                  233                             309\nindustri…\nTotal        $       1,623           0.32  %            45  %    $        6,274                  $       16,775\nwholesale\n(a) Represents the balance of the retained loans which\nwere still under payment deferral, divided by the\nrespective industry total retained loans balance.\nIn addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form\nof covenant modifications. These types of assistance,\nboth payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are\ngenerally not reported as TDRs, either because the\nmodifications were insignificant or they qualified for\nthe option to suspend the application of accounting\nguidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and\nextended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. A\nportion of the $1.6 billion of loans under payment\ndeferral as December 31,\n2020 could become TDRs in future periods, depending on\nthe nature and timing of further modifications or\npayment arrangements offered to these borrowers. If\nthe $1.6 billion of loans under payment deferral were\nconsidered TDRs, the Firm estimates that it would\nresult in an increase in standardized RWA of as much\nas $500 million. Loans under assistance continue to be\nrisk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall\ncredit risk management framework. As of December 31,\n2020, predominantly all of these loans were considered\nperforming.\nWholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings\nprofile\nThe following tables present the maturity and internal\nrisk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit\nportfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Firm\ngenerally considers internal ratings with qualitative\ncharacteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as\ninvestment grade, and takes into consideration\ncollateral and structural support when determining the\ninternal risk rating for each credit facility.

Prior-period\namounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n(c) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions\nfrom trading assets to loans, which resulted in a corresponding reclassification of certain off-balance sheet\ncommitments. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n(d) Represents loans held-for-sale, primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained\nportfolio, and loans at fair value.\n(e) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.\n(f) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown\nis based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the\ncredit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management\nactivities are executed with investment-grade counterparties.\n(g) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally\nbased on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at December 31,\n2020, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.\nWholesale credit exposure – industry exposures\nThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification\nof its industry exposures, and pays particular\nattention to industries with actual or potential\ncredit concerns.\nExposures deemed criticized align with the U.S.\nbanking regulators’ definition of criticized\nexposures, which consist of the special mention,\nsubstandard and doubtful\ncategories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans\nheld-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $41.6\nbillion at December 31, 2020, compared with $15.1\nbillion at December 31, 2019, representing\napproximately 4.0% and 1.5% of total wholesale credit\nexposure, respectively. The increase in total\ncriticized exposure was largely driven by downgrades\nin Consumer & Retail, Oil & Gas and Real Estate due to\nimpacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, and to a lesser\nextent, net portfolio activity in Technology, Media &\nTelecommunications. Predominantly all of the $41.6\nbillion was performing and largely undrawn.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    123\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

The contractual amounts of these financial\ninstruments represent the maximum possible credit risk\nshould the clients draw down on these commitments or\nwhen the Firm fulfills its obligations under these\nguarantees, and the clients subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of these contracts.\nMost of these commitments and guarantees have\nhistorically been refinanced, extended, cancelled, or\nexpired without being drawn upon or a default\noccurring. As a result, the Firm does not believe that\nthe total contractual amount of these wholesale\nlending-related commitments is representative of the\nFirm’s expected future credit exposure or funding\nrequirements. Refer to Note 28 for further information\non wholesale lending-related commitments. Receivables\nfrom Customers Receivables from customers reflect\nheld-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients\nin CIB, CCB and AWM that are collateralized by assets\nmaintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g.,\ncash on deposit, liquid and readily marketable debt or\nequity securities). Because of this collateralization,\nno allowance for credit losses is generally held\nagainst these receivables. To manage its credit risk\nthe Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors\nthe required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.\nThese receivables are reported within accrued interest\nand accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Clearing services The Firm provides\nclearing services for clients entering into certain\nsecurities and derivative contracts. Through the\nprovision of these services the Firm is exposed to the\nrisk of non-performance by its clients and may be\nrequired to share in losses incurred by CCPs. Where\npossible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk\nto its clients through the collection of adequate\nmargin at inception and throughout the life of the\ntransactions and can also cease the provision of\nclearing services if clients do not adhere to their\nobligations under the clearing agreement. Refer to\nNote 28 for a further discussion of clearing services.\nDerivative contracts Derivatives enable clients and\ncounterparties to manage risks including credit risk\nand risks arising from fluctuations in interest rates,\nforeign exchange, equities, and commodities. The Firm\nmakes markets in derivatives in order to meet these\nneeds and uses derivatives to manage certain risks\nassociated with net open risk positions from its\nmarket-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The\nFirm also uses derivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk exposure. The\nnature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to\nwhich the Firm is exposed. For OTC derivatives the\nFirm is exposed to\nthe credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For\nexchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures\nand options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-\ncleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to\nthe credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures\narising from derivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and\ncollateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s\nover-the-counter derivative transactions subject to\ncollateral agreements — excluding foreign exchange\nspot trades, which are not typically covered by\ncollateral agreements due to their short maturity and\ncentrally cleared trades that are settled daily — was\napproximately 88% and 90% at December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for additional\ninformation on the Firm’s use of collateral\nagreements. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion\nof derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement\ntypes. The fair value of derivative receivables\nreported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $79.6\nbillion and $49.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and\n2019, respectively, with increases in CIB resulting\nfrom market movements. Derivative receivables\nrepresent the fair value of the derivative contracts\nafter giving effect to legally enforceable master\nnetting agreements and the related cash collateral\nheld by the Firm. In addition, the Firm held liquid\nsecurities and other cash collateral that the Firm\nbelieves is legally enforceable and may be used as\nsecurity when the fair value of the client’s exposure\nis in the Firm’s favor. Liquid securities represents\nhigh quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the\nFirm believes is legally enforceable.

Although this collateral does not reduce the\nbalances and is not included in the table above, it is\navailable as security against potential exposure that\ncould arise should the fair value of the client’s\nderivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer\nto Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use\nof collateral agreements.\nWhile useful as a current view of credit exposure, the\nnet fair value of the derivative receivables does not\ncapture the potential future variability of that\ncredit exposure. To capture the potential future\nvariability of credit exposure, the Firm calculates,\non a client-by-client basis, three measures of\npotential derivatives-related credit loss: Peak,\nDerivative Risk Equivalent (“DRE”), and Average\nexposure (“AVG”). These measures all incorporate\nnetting and collateral benefits, where applicable.\nPeak represents a conservative measure of potential\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, to a counterparty calculated in a manner\nthat is broadly equivalent to a 97.5% confidence level\nover the life of the transaction. Peak is the primary\nmeasure used by the Firm for setting credit limits for\nderivative contracts, senior management reporting and\nderivatives exposure management.\nDRE exposure is a measure that expresses the risk of\nderivative exposure, including the benefit of\ncollateral, on a basis intended to be equivalent to\nthe risk of loan exposures. DRE is a less extreme\nmeasure of potential credit loss than Peak and is used\nas an input for aggregating derivative credit risk\nexposures with loans and other credit risk.\nFinally, AVG is a measure of the expected fair value\nof the Firm’s derivative exposure, including the\nbenefit of collateral, at future time periods. AVG\nover the total life of the derivative contract is used\nas the primary metric for pricing purposes and is used\nto calculate credit risk capital and CVA, as further\ndescribed below.\nThe fair value of the Firm’s derivative receivables\nincorporates CVA to reflect the credit quality of\ncounterparties. CVA is based on the Firm’s AVG to a\ncounterparty and the counterparty’s credit spread in\nthe credit derivatives market. The Firm believes that\nactive risk management is essential to controlling the\ndynamic credit risk in the derivatives portfolio. In\naddition, the Firm’s risk management process takes\ninto consideration the potential impact of wrong-way\nrisk, which is broadly defined as the risk that\nexposure to a counterparty is positively correlated\nwith the impact of a default by the same counterparty,\nwhich could cause exposure to increase at the same\ntime as the counterparty’s capacity to meet its\nobligations is decreasing. Many factors may influence\nthe nature and magnitude of these correlations over\ntime. To the extent that these correlations are\nidentified, the Firm may adjust the CVA associated\nwith a particular counterparty’s AVG. The Firm risk\nmanages exposure to changes in CVA by entering into\ncredit derivative contracts, as well as interest rate,\nforeign exchange, equity and commodity derivative\ncontracts.\nThe below graph shows exposure profiles to the Firm’s\ncurrent derivatives portfolio over the next 10 years\nas calculated by the Peak, DRE and AVG metrics. The\nthree measures generally show that exposure will\ndecline after the first year, if no new trades are\nadded to the portfolio.\nExposure profile of derivatives measures\nDecember 31, 2020\n(in billions)\n130    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nCredit derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-\nmaker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated with various exposures. Credit\nportfolio management activities Included in the Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used to mitigate\nthe credit risk associated with traditional lending activities (loans and lending-related commitments) and\nderivatives counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses (collectively, “credit portfolio management\nactivities”). Information on credit portfolio management activities is provided in the table below. The Firm also\nuses credit derivatives as an end-user to manage other exposures, including credit risk arising from certain\nsecurities held in the Firm’s market-making businesses. These credit derivatives are not included in credit\nportfolio management activities.\nCredit derivatives used in credit portfolio management\nactivities                                                           Notional amount of protection\nDecember 31, (in millions)                                                   purchased and sold(b)\nCredit derivatives used to manage:                                                            2020         2019\nLoans and lending-related commitments                             $                          3,877    $   2,047\nDerivative receivables(a)                                                                   18,362       16,483\nCredit derivatives used in credit                                 $                         22,239    $  18,530\nportfolio management activities\n(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation. (b) Amounts are\npresented net, considering the Firm’s net protection\npurchased or sold with respect to each underlying\nreference entity or index. The credit derivatives used\nin credit portfolio management activities do not\nqualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP; these\nderivatives are reported at fair value, with gains and\nlosses recognized in principal transactions revenue.\nIn contrast, the loans and lending-related commitments\nbeing risk-managed are accounted for on an accrual\nbasis. This asymmetry in accounting treatment, between\nloans and lending-related commitments and the credit\nderivatives used in credit portfolio management\nactivities, causes earnings volatility that is not\nrepresentative, in the Firm’s view, of the true\nchanges in value of the Firm’s overall credit\nexposure. The effectiveness of credit default swaps\n(“CDS”) as a hedge against the Firm’s exposures may\nvary depending on a number of factors, including the\nnamed reference entity (i.e., the Firm may experience\nlosses on specific exposures that are different than\nthe named reference entities in the purchased CDS);\nthe contractual terms of the CDS (which may have a\ndefined credit event that does not align with an\nactual loss realized by the Firm); and the maturity of\nthe Firm’s CDS protection (which in some cases may be\nshorter than the Firm’s exposures). However, the Firm\ngenerally seeks to purchase credit protection with a\nmaturity date that is the same or similar to the\nmaturity date of the exposure for which the protection\nwas purchased, and remaining differences in maturity\nare actively monitored and managed by the Firm.

The adoption of this guidance\nestablished a single allowance framework for all\nfinancial assets measured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This\nframework requires that management’s estimate reflects\ncredit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected\nlife and considers expected future changes in\nmacroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further\ninformation. The Firm’s allowance for credit losses\ncomprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and\nrisk-rated) and is presented separately on the\nConsolidated balance sheets, • the allowance for\nlending-related commitments, which is presented on the\nConsolidated balance sheets in accounts payable and\nother liabilities, and • the allowance for credit\nlosses on investment securities, which covers the\nFirm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within\nInvestment Securities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. The allowance for credit losses increased\ncompared with December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting\nthe deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic\nenvironment, in particular in the first half of 2020,\nas a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nconsisting of: • a net $7.4 billion addition in\nconsumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio,\nand • a net $4.7 billion addition in wholesale, across\nthe LOBs, impacting multiple industries. The adoption\nof CECL on January 1, 2020, resulted in a $4.3 billion\naddition to the allowance for credit losses.\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance during 2020 The\nincrease in the allowance for loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments was primarily driven by an\nincrease in the provision for credit losses,\nreflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty around\nthe future macroeconomic environment as a result of\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December\n31, 2020, the Firm’s central case reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates of approximately 7% through the\nsecond quarter of 2021 and remaining above 5% until\nthe second half of 2022. This compared with relatively\nlow levels of unemployment of approximately 4%\nthroughout 2020 and 2021 in the Firm’s January 1, 2020\ncentral case. Further, while the Firm’s January 1,\n2020 central case U.S. GDP forecast reflected a 1.7%\nexpansion in 2020, actual U.S. GDP contracted\napproximately 2.5% in 2020. As of December 31, 2020,\nthe Firm’s central case assumptions reflect a return\nto pre-pandemic GDP levels in the fourth quarter of\n2021. Due to elevated uncertainty in the near term\noutlook, driven by the potential for increased\ninfection rates and related lock downs resulting from\nthe pandemic, as well as the\nprospect that government and other consumer relief\nmeasures set to expire may not be extended, the Firm\nhas placed significant weighting on its adverse\nscenarios. These scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case\nassumptions, resulting in weighted average U.S.\nunemployment rates remaining elevated throughout 2021\nand 2022, ending the fourth quarter of 2022 at\napproximately 6%, and in U.S. GDP ending 2022\napproximately 0.9% higher than fourth quarter 2019\nactual pre-pandemic levels. The Firm’s central case\nassumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S.\nreal GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at January 1, 2020\n2Q20       4Q20(b)       2Q21\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                             3.7  %        3.8  %     4.0  %\nCumulative change in U.S. real GDP from                               0.9  %        1.7  %     2.4  %\n12/31/2019\nAssumptions at December 31, 2020\n2Q21       4Q21       2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                                               6.8  %     5.7  %     5.1  %\nCumulative change in U.S. real GDP from                                -1.9  %     0.6  %     2.0  %\n12/31/2019\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate. (b) 4Q20 actual U.S. unemployment\nrate (quarterly average) was 6.8%. 4Q20 actual\ncumulative change in U.S. real GDP from 4Q19 was\n(2.5%). Subsequent changes to this forecast and\nrelated estimates will be reflected in the provision\nfor credit losses in future periods. Refer to Note 13\nand Note 10 for a description of the policies,\nmethodologies and judgments used to determine the\nFirm’s allowances for credit losses on loans, lending-\nrelated commitments, and investment securities.

In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans\nand lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale\nportfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have\nbeen revised to conform with the current presentation.

A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was removed from a pool.\n(b) Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a\nTDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment.\nThe asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR is\ncalculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty\nrates.\n(c) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted\nby regulatory guidance.\n(d) Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $ 78million and a provision for credit\nlosses of $ 68million as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    133\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nINVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT\nInvestment portfolio risk is the risk associated with\nthe loss of principal or a reduction in expected\nreturns on investments arising from the investment\nsecurities portfolio or from principal investments.\nThe investment securities portfolio is predominantly\nheld by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm's\nbalance sheet or asset-liability management\nobjectives. Principal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held non-traded financial instruments and\nare managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are\ntypically intended to be held over extended periods\nand, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for\nshort-term realized gains with respect to these\ninvestments.\nInvestment securities risk\nInvestment securities risk includes the exposure\nassociated with a default in the payment of principal\nand interest. This risk is mitigated given that the\ninvestment securities portfolio held by Treasury and\nCIO is predominantly invested in high-quality\nsecurities. At December 31, 2020, the Treasury and CIO\ninvestment securities portfolio, net of allowance for\ncredit losses, was $587.9 billion, and the average\ncredit rating of the securities comprising the\nportfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where\navailable and where not available, based primarily\nupon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate\nsegment results on pages 83–84 and Note 10 for further\ninformation on the investment securities portfolio and\ninternal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management\non pages 135–142 for further information on the market\nrisk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity\nRisk Management on pages 102–108 for further\ninformation on related liquidity risk.\nGovernance and oversight\nInvestment securities risks are governed by the Firm’s\nRisk Appetite framework, and reviewed at the CTC Risk\nCommittee with regular updates to the Board Risk\nCommittee.\nThe Firm’s independent control functions are\nresponsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the\ncarrying value of investment securities in accordance\nwith relevant policies. Approved levels for investment\nsecurities are established for each risk category,\nincluding capital and credit risks.\nPrincipal investment risk\nPrincipal investments are typically privately held\nnon-traded financial instruments representing\nownership or other forms of junior capital and span\nmultiple asset classes. These investments are made by\ndedicated investing businesses or as part of a broader\nbusiness strategy. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments made\nto enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business\nstrategies . The Firm’s investments will continue to\nevolve in line with its strategies, including the\nFirm’s commitment to support underserved communities\nand minority-owned businesses. The Firm’s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and\nare reflected within their respective financial\nresults. The aggregate carrying values of the\nprincipal investment portfolios have not been\nsignificantly affected by recent market events as a\nresult of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the duration\nand severity of adverse macroeconomic conditions could\nsubject certain principal investments to impairments,\nwrite-downs, or other negative impacts.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate\ncarrying values of the principal investment portfolios\nwere $27.5 billion and $24.2 billion, respectively,\nwhich included tax-oriented investments (e.g.,\nalternative energy and affordable housing investments)\nof $21.3 billion and $18.2 billion, respectively, and\nprivate equity, various debt and equity instruments,\nand real assets of $6.2 billion and $6.0 billion,\nrespectively.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Firm’s approach to managing principal risk is\nconsistent with the Firm’s risk governance structure.\nA Firmwide risk policy framework exists for all\nprincipal investing activities and includes approval\nby executives who are independent from the investing\nbusinesses, as appropriate.\nThe Firm’s independent control functions are\nresponsible for reviewing the appropriateness of the\ncarrying value of investments in accordance with\nrelevant policies. As part of the risk governance\nstructure, approved levels for investments are\nestablished and monitored for each relevant business\nor segment in order to manage the overall size of the\nportfolios. The Firm also conducts stress testing on\nthese portfolios using specific scenarios that\nestimate losses based on significant market moves\nand/or other risk events.\n134    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of\nchanges in market factors, such as interest and\nforeign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices,\ncredit spreads or implied volatilities, on the value\nof assets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term.\nMarket Risk Management\nMarket Risk Management monitors market risks\nthroughout the Firm and defines market risk policies\nand procedures.\nMarket Risk Management seeks to manage risk,\nfacilitate efficient risk/return decisions, reduce\nvolatility in operating performance and provide\ntransparency into the Firm’s market risk profile for\nsenior management, the Board of Directors and\nregulators. Market Risk Management is responsible for\nthe following functions:\nMaintaining a market risk policy framework\nIndependently measuring, monitoring and controlling\nLOB, Corporate, and Firmwide market risk\nDefining, approving and monitoring of limits\nPerforming stress testing and qualitative risk\nassessments\nRisk measurement\nMeasures used to capture market risk\nThere is no single measure to capture market risk and\ntherefore Market Risk Management uses various metrics,\nboth statistical and nonstatistical, to assess risk\nincluding:\nValue-at-risk (VaR)\nStress testing\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nEarnings-at-risk\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nRisk monitoring and control\nMarket risk exposure is managed primarily through a\nseries of limits set in the context of the market\nenvironment and business strategy. In setting limits,\nMarket Risk Management takes into consideration\nfactors such as market volatility, product liquidity,\naccommodation of client business, and management\nexperience. Market Risk Management maintains different\nlevels of limits. Firm level limits include VaR and\nstress limits. Similarly, LOB and Corporate limits\ninclude VaR and stress limits and may be supplemented\nby certain nonstatistical risk measures such as profit\nand loss drawdowns. Limits may also be set within the\nLOBs and Corporate, as well as at the legal entity\nlevel.\nMarket Risk Management sets limits and regularly\nreviews and updates them as appropriate. Senior\nmanagement is responsible for reviewing and approving\ncertain of these risk limits on an ongoing basis.\nLimits that have not been reviewed within specified\ntime periods by Market Risk Management are reported to\nsenior management. The LOBs and Corporate are\nresponsible for adhering to established limits against\nwhich exposures are monitored and reported.\nLimit breaches are required to be reported in a timely\nmanner to limit approvers, which include Market Risk\nManagement and senior management. In the event of a\nbreach, Market Risk Management consults with\nappropriate members of the Firm to determine the\nsuitable course of action required to return the\napplicable positions to compliance, which may include\na reduction in risk in order to remedy the breach or\ngranting a temporary increase in limits to accommodate\nan expected increase in client activity and/or market\nvolatility. Certain Firm, Corporate or LOB-level limit\nbreaches are escalated as appropriate.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nMarket Risk Management continues to actively monitor\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk\nexposures by leveraging existing risk measures and\ncontrols.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to measure\ncertain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in\nmarket conditions occur, such as those observed at the\nonset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional\ndiscussion on model uncertainty refer to Estimations\nand Model Risk Management on page 151.\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s\nexisting market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly\nover time. This is increasingly important in periods\nof sustained, heightened market volatility.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    135\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nThe following table summarizes the predominant business activities and related market risks, as well as positions\nwhich give rise to market risk and certain measures used to capture those risks, for each LOB and Corporate.\nIn addition to the predominant business activities, each LOB and Corporate may engage in principal investing\nactivities.

The\nFirm has a single VaR framework used as a basis for\ncalculating Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.\nThe framework is employed across the Firm using\nhistorical simulation based on data for the previous\n12 months. The framework’s approach assumes that\nhistorical changes in market values are representative\nof the distribution of potential outcomes in the\nimmediate future. The Firm believes the use of Risk\nManagement VaR provides a daily measure of risk that\nis closely aligned to risk management decisions made\nby the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market\nrisk measures, provides the appropriate information\nneeded to respond to risk events.\nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming\na one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.\nRisk Management VaR provides a consistent framework to\nmeasure risk profiles and levels of diversification\nacross product types and is used for aggregating risks\nand monitoring limits across businesses. VaR results\nare reported to senior management, the Board of\nDirectors and regulators.\nUnder the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology,\nassuming current changes in market values are\nconsistent with the historical changes used in the\nsimulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR\n“backtesting exceptions,” defined as losses greater\nthan that predicted by VaR estimates, an average of\nfive times every 100 trading days. The number of VaR\nbacktesting exceptions observed can differ from the\nstatistically expected number of backtesting\nexceptions if the current level of market volatility\nis materially different from the level of market\nvolatility during the 12 months of historical data\nused in the VaR calculation.\nUnderlying the overall VaR model framework are\nindividual VaR models that simulate historical market\nreturns for individual risk factors and/or product\ntypes. To capture material market risks as part of the\nFirm’s risk management framework, comprehensive VaR\nmodel calculations are performed daily for businesses\nwhose activities give rise to market risk. These VaR\nmodels are granular and incorporate numerous risk\nfactors and inputs to simulate daily changes in market\nvalues over the historical period; inputs are selected\nbased on the risk profile of each portfolio, as\nsensitivities and historical time series used to\ngenerate daily market values may be different across\nproduct types or risk management systems. The VaR\nmodel results across all portfolios are aggregated at\nthe Firm level.\nAs VaR is based on historical data, it is an imperfect\nmeasure of market risk exposure and potential future\nlosses. In addition, based on their reliance on\navailable historical data, limited time horizons, and\nother factors, VaR measures are inherently limited in\ntheir ability to measure certain risks and to predict\nlosses, particularly those associated with market\nilliquidity and sudden or severe shifts in market\nconditions.\nFor certain products, specific risk parameters are not\ncaptured in VaR due to the lack of liquidity and\navailability of appropriate historical data. The Firm\nuses proxies to estimate the VaR for these and other\nproducts when daily time series are not available. It\nis likely that using an actual price-based time series\nfor these products, if available, would affect the VaR\nresults presented. The Firm therefore considers other\nnonstatistical measures such as stress testing, in\naddition to VaR, to capture and manage its market risk\npositions.\nThe daily market data used in VaR models may be\ndifferent than the independent third-party data\ncollected for VCG price testing in its monthly\nvaluation process. For example, in cases where market\nprices are not observable, or where proxies are used\nin VaR historical time series, the data sources may\ndiffer. Refer to Valuation process in Note 2 for\nfurther information on the Firm’s valuation process.\nAs VaR model calculations require daily data and a\nconsistent source for valuation, it may not be\npractical to use the data collected in the VCG monthly\nvaluation process for VaR model calculations.\nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling\ntechniques and measurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical comparisons of VaR\nresults. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 151 for information regarding model\nreviews and approvals.\nThe Firm calculates separately a daily aggregated VaR\nin accordance with regulatory rules (“Regulatory\nVaR”), which is used to derive the Firm’s regulatory\nVaR-based capital requirements under Basel III. This\nRegulatory VaR model framework currently assumes a ten\nbusiness-day holding period and an expected tail loss\nmethodology which approximates a 99% confidence level.\nRegulatory VaR is applied to “covered” positions as\ndefined by Basel III, which may be different than the\npositions included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR.\nFor example, credit derivative hedges of accrual loans\nare included in the Firm’s Risk Management VaR, while\nRegulatory VaR excludes these credit derivative\nhedges. In addition, in contrast to the Firm’s Risk\nManagement VaR, Regulatory VaR currently excludes the\ndiversification benefit for certain VaR models.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    137\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nRefer to JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are available on the\nFirm’s website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR and the other components of market risk regulatory\ncapital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure, stressed VaR-based measure and the respective backtesting).\nThe table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

As a result average total VaR increased by $52\nmillion for the year-ended December 31, 2020 when\ncompared with the prior year driven by the fixed\nincome and commodities risk types.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope\nof VaR to exclude positions related to the risk\nmanagement of interest rate exposure from changes in\nthe Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option\nelected liabilities, and included these positions in\nother sensitivity-based measures. Additionally,\neffective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of\nVaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option\nelected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-\nbased measures to more effectively measure the risk\nfrom these loans.

The gains and losses in the chart below do not\nreflect the Firm’s revenue results as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated\nwith the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management\nactivities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of\ntotal net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of\nbacktesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital\nrules.\nThe following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed\nin the Market Risk section of the Firm’ s B asel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are\nbased on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 162 of the 260 days, and observed 10 VaR\nbacktesting exceptions, which were predominantly driven by volatility at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic that\nwas materially higher than the levels realized in the historical data used for the VaR calculation. Firmwide\nbacktesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets posted\nlosses, as disclosed in CIB Markets revenue, as the population of positions which compose each metric are different\nand due to the exclusion of select components of total net revenue in backtesting gains and losses as described\nabove.

While VaR reflects the risk of\nloss due to adverse changes in markets using recent\nhistorical market behavior, stress testing reflects\nthe risk of loss from hypothetical changes in the\nvalue of market risk sensitive positions applied\nsimultaneously. Stress testing measures the Firm’s\nvulnerability to losses under a range of stressed but\npossible economic and market scenarios. The results\nare used to understand the exposures responsible for\nthose potential losses and are measured against\nlimits.\nThe Firm’s stress framework covers market risk\nsensitive positions in the LOBs and Corporate. The\nframework is used to calculate multiple magnitudes of\npotential stress for both market rallies and market\nsell-offs, assuming significant changes in market\nfactors such as credit spreads, equity prices,\ninterest rates, currency rates and commodity prices,\nand combines them in multiple ways to capture an array\nof hypothetical economic and market scenarios.\nThe Firm generates a number of scenarios that focus on\ntail events in specific asset classes and geographies,\nincluding how the event may impact multiple market\nfactors simultaneously. Scenarios also incorporate\nspecific idiosyncratic risks and stress basis risk\nbetween different products. The flexibility in the\nstress framework allows the Firm to construct new\nscenarios that can test the outcomes against possible\nfuture stress events. Stress testing results are\nreported on a regular basis to senior management of\nthe Firm, as appropriate.\nStress scenarios are governed by an overall stress\nframework and are subject to the standards outlined in\nthe Firm’s policies related to model risk management.\nSignificant changes to the framework are reviewed as\nappropriate.\nThe Firm’s stress testing framework is utilized in\ncalculating the Firm’s CCAR and other stress test\nresults, which are reported to the Board of Directors.\nIn addition, stress testing results are incorporated\ninto the Firm’s Risk Appetite framework, and are\nreported periodically to the Board Risk Committee.\nProfit and loss drawdowns\nProfit and loss drawdowns are used to highlight\ntrading losses above certain levels of risk tolerance.\nA profit and loss drawdown is a decline in revenue\nfrom its year-to-date peak level.\nEarnings-at-risk\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s\nreported net income is important as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.\nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading\nactivities but also from the Firm’s traditional\nbanking activities, which include extension of loans\nand credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing\ndebt as well as from the investment securities\nportfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 for a\nsummary by\nLOB and Corporate, identifying positions included in\nearnings-at-risk .\nThe CTC Risk Committee establishes the Firm’s\nstructural interest rate risk policy and related\nlimits, which are subject to approval by the Board\nRisk Committee. Treasury and CIO, working in\npartnership with the LOBs, calculates the Firm’s\nstructural interest rate risk profile and reviews it\nwith senior management, including the CTC Risk\nCommittee. In addition, oversight of structural\ninterest rate risk is managed through a dedicated risk\nfunction reporting to the CTC CRO. This risk function\nis responsible for providing independent oversight and\ngovernance around assumptions and establishing and\nmonitoring limits for structural interest rate risk.\nThe Firm manages structural interest rate risk\ngenerally through its investment securities portfolio\nand interest rate derivatives.\nStructural interest rate risk can occur due to a\nvariety of factors, including:\nDifferences in timing among the maturity or\nrepricing of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet\ninstruments\nDifferences in the amounts of assets, liabilities\nand off-balance sheet instruments that are maturing or\nrepricing at the same time\nDifferences in the amounts by which short-term and\nlong-term market interest rates change (for example,\nchanges in the slope of the yield curve)\nThe impact of changes in the maturity of various\nassets, liabilities or off-balance sheet instruments\nas interest rates change\nThe Firm manages interest rate exposure related to its\nassets and liabilities on a consolidated, Firmwide\nbasis. Business units transfer their interest rate\nrisk to Treasury and CIO through funds transfer\npricing, which takes into account the elements of\ninterest rate exposure that can be risk-managed in\nfinancial markets. These elements include asset and\nliability balances and contractual rates of interest,\ncontractual principal payment schedules, expected\nprepayment experience, interest rate reset dates and\nmaturities, rate indices used for repricing, and any\ninterest rate ceilings or floors for adjustable rate\nproducts.\nOne way the Firm evaluates its structural interest\nrate risk is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-\nrisk estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a\ngiven interest rate scenario. It is presented as a\nsensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest\nincome and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The\nbaseline uses market interest rates and in the case of\ndeposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts\nsimulations of changes to this baseline for interest\nrate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in\nU.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar”\ncurrencies). These simulations primarily include\nretained loans, deposits, deposits with banks,\ninvestment securities, long-term debt and any related\ninterest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of\npositions in risk management VaR and other\nsensitivity-based measures as described on page 136.\n140    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a net interest income baseline, over the\nfollowing 12 months utilizing multiple assumptions.\nThese scenarios include a parallel shift involving\nchanges to both short-term and long-term rates by an\nequal amount; a steeper yield curve involving holding\nshort-term rates constant and increasing long-term\nrates; and a flatter yield curve involving increasing\nshort-term rates and holding long-term rates constant.\nThese scenarios consider many different factors,\nincluding: • The impact on exposures as a result of\ninstantaneous changes in interest rates from baseline\nrates. • Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not\ninclude assumptions about actions that could be taken\nby the Firm or its clients and customers in response\nto any such instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage\nprepayment assumptions are based on the interest rates\nused in the scenarios compared with underlying\ncontractual rates, the time since origination, and\nother factors which are updated periodically based on\nhistorical experience. • The pricing sensitivity of\ndeposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount\nby which deposit rates paid could change upon a given\nchange in market interest rates over the cycle. The\ndeposit rates paid in these scenarios may differ from\nactual deposit rates paid, due to repricing lags and\nother factors. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios\nare periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to\nchanges in the composition of the Firm’s balance\nsheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in\nthe Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a\nrelevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure,\nthe earnings at risk analysis does not represent a\nforecast of the Firm’s net interest income (Refer to\nOutlook on page 49 for additional information) .\nThe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in\nthe table below.\nDecember 31,\n(in billions)\nParallel shift:                          2020       2019\n+100 bps shift in rates               $   6.9    $   0.3\nSteeper yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in long-term rates         2.4        1.2\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates        4.5       -0.9\nThe change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as\nof December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019\nreflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower\nshort-term and long-term rates as well as the impact\nof changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. In addition,\nduring the fourth quarter of 2020 as part of the\nFirm’s continuous evaluation and periodic enhancement\nto its earnings-at-risk calculations, the Firm updated\nthe deposit rates paid betas for consumer deposit\nproducts based upon observed pricing during the most\nrecent economic cycle. In the absence of this update,\nthe Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as of December\n31, 2020 would have been lower by $2.0 billion to the\n+100bps shift in short-term and parallel rate\nscenarios. The Firm’s sensitivity to rates is\nprimarily a result of assets repricing at a faster\npace than deposits. Based upon current and implied\nmarket rates as of December 31, 2020, scenarios\nreflecting lower rates could result in negative\ninterest rates. The U.S. has never experienced an\ninterest rate environment where the Federal Reserve\nhas a negative interest rate policy. While the impact\nof negative interest rates on the Firm's earnings-at-\nrisk would vary by scenario, a parallel shift downward\nof up to 100bps would negatively impact net interest\nincome. In a negative interest rate environment, the\nmodeling assumptions used for certain assets and\nliabilities require additional management judgment and\ntherefore, the actual outcomes may differ from these\nassumptions. The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities\nare presented in the table below.\nDecember 31,\n(in billions)\nParallel shift:                          2020       2019\n+100 bps shift in rates               $   0.9    $   0.5\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates        0.8        0.5\nThe results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate\nscenario involving a steeper yield curve with long-\nterm rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term\nrates staying at current levels were not material to\nthe Firm’s earnings-at-risk at December 31, 2020 and\n2019.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    141\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nNon-U.S. dollar foreign exchange risk\nNon-U.S. dollar FX risk is the risk that changes in foreign exchange rates affect the value of the Firm’s assets or\nliabilities or future results. The Firm has structural non-U.S. dollar FX exposures arising from capital\ninvestments, forecasted expense and revenue, the investment securities portfolio and non-U.S. dollar-denominated\ndebt issuance. Treasury and CIO, working in partnership with the LOBs, primarily manage these risks on behalf of\nthe Firm. Treasury and CIO may hedge certain of these risks using derivatives.\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential\nimpact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market\nvariables.

The Country Risk Management group actively\nmonitors the various portfolios which may be impacted\nby these developments and measures the extent to which\nthe Firm’s exposures are diversified given the Firm’s\nstrategy and risk tolerance relative to a country.\nOrganization and management\nCountry Risk Management is an independent risk\nmanagement function that assesses, manages and\nmonitors country risk originated across the Firm.\nThe Firm’s country risk management function includes\nthe following activities:\nMaintaining policies, procedures and standards\nconsistent with a comprehensive country risk framework\nAssigning sovereign ratings, assessing country risks\nand establishing risk tolerance relative to a country\nMeasuring and monitoring country risk exposure and\nstress across the Firm\nManaging and approving country limits and reporting\ntrends and limit breaches to senior management\nDeveloping surveillance tools, such as signaling\nmodels and ratings indicators, for early\nidentification of potential country risk concerns\nProviding country risk scenario analysis\nSources and measurement\nThe Firm is exposed to country risk through its\nlending and deposits, investing, and market-making\nactivities, whether cross-border or locally funded.\nCountry exposure includes activity with both\ngovernment and private-sector entities in a country.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk management\napproach, attribution of exposure to an individual\ncountry is based on the country where the largest\nproportion of the assets of the counterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor are located or where the largest\nproportion of its revenue is derived, which may be\ndifferent than the domicile (i.e. legal residence) or\ncountry of incorporation.\nIndividual country exposures reflect an aggregation of\nthe Firm’s risk to an immediate default, with zero\nrecovery, of the counterparties, issuers, obligors or\nguarantors attributed to that country. Activities\nwhich result in contingent or indirect exposure to a\ncountry are not included in the country exposure\nmeasure (for exa mple, providing clearing services or\nsecondary exposure to collateral on securities\nfinancing receivables).\nAssumptions are sometimes required in determining the\nmeasurement and allocation of country exposure,\nparticularly in the case of certain non-linear or\nindex products, or where the nature of the\ncounterparty, issuer,\nobligor or guarantor is not suitable for attribution\nto an individual country. The use of different\nmeasurement approaches or assumptions could affect the\namount of reported country exposure.\nUnder the Firm’s internal country risk measurement\nframework:\nLending exposures are measured at the total\ncommitted amount (funded and unfunded), net of the\nallowance for credit losses and eligible cash and\nmarketable securities collateral received\nDeposits are measured as the cash balances placed\nwith central and commercial banks\nSecurities financing exposures are measured at their\nreceivable balance, net of eligible collateral\nreceived\nDebt and equity securities are measured at the fair\nvalue of all positions, including both long and short\npositions\nCounterparty exposure on derivative receivables is\nmeasured at the derivative’s fair value, net of the\nfair value of the eligible collateral received\nCredit derivatives protection purchased and sold is\nreported based on the underlying reference entity and\nis measured at the notional amount of protection\npurchased or sold, net of the fair value of the\nrecognized derivative receivable or payable. Credit\nderivatives protection purchased and sold in the\nFirm’s market-making activities is measured on a net\nbasis, as such activities often result in selling and\npurchasing protection related to the same underlying\nreference entity; this reflects the manner in which\nthe Firm manages these exposures\nThe Firm’s internal country risk reporting differs\nfrom the reporting provided under the FFIEC bank\nregulatory requirements. Refer to Cross-border\noutstandings on page 318 of the 2020 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on the FFIEC’s reporting\nmethodology.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    143\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nStress testing Stress testing is an important component of the Firm’s country risk management framework, which aims\nto estimate and limit losses arising from a country crisis by measuring the impact of adverse asset price movements\nto a country based on market shocks combined with counterparty specific assumptions. Country Risk Management\nperiodically designs and runs tailored stress scenarios to test vulnerabilities to individual countries or sets of\ncountries in response to specific or potential market events, sector performance concerns, sovereign actions and\ngeopolitical risks. These tailored stress results are used to inform potential risk reduction across the Firm, as\nnecessary. COVID-19 Pandemic Country Risk Management continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nleveraging existing stress testing, exposure reporting and controls, as well as tailored analysis, to assess the\nextent to which individual countries may be adversely impacted. Risk reporting Country exposure and stress are\nmeasured and reported regularly, and used by Country Risk Management to identify trends, and monitor high usages\nand breaches against limits. For country risk management purposes, the Firm may report exposure to jurisdictions\nthat are not fully autonomous, including Special Administrative Regions (“SAR”) and dependent territories,\nseparately from the independent sovereign states with which they are associated. The following table presents the\nFirm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of December 31, 2020, and their comparative exposures as\nof December 31, 2019. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by individual\ncountry, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of\nany actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluct uate from period to period due to\nclient activity and market flows. The overall increase in top 20 exposures was largely driven by client activity\nand growth in client deposits, relative to the period ending December 31, 2019.

Operational risk is\ninherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest\nitself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,\nbusiness interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate\nemployee behavior, failure to comply with applicable\nlaws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform\nin accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk\nManagement attempts to manage operational risk at\nappropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial\nposition, the characteristics of its businesses, and\nthe markets and regulatory environments in which it\noperates.\nOperational Risk Management Framework\nThe Firm’s Compliance, Conduct, and Operational Risk\n(“CCOR”) Management Framework is designed to enable\nthe Firm to govern, identify, measure, monitor and\ntest, manage and report on the Firm’s operational\nrisk.\nOperational Risk Governance\nThe LOBs and Corporate are responsible for the\nmanagement of operational risk. The Control Management\nOrganization, which consists of control managers\nwithin each LOB and Corporate, is responsible for the\nday-to-day execution of the CCOR Framework and the\nevaluation of the effectiveness of their control\nenvironments to determine where targeted remediation\nefforts may be required.\nThe Firm’s Global Chief Compliance Officer (“CCO”) and\nFRE for Operational Risk is responsible for defining\nthe CCOR Management Framework and establishing minimum\nstandards for its execution. Operational Risk Officers\n(“OROs”) report to both the LOB CROs and to the FRE\nfor Operational Risk, and are independent of the\nrespective businesses or functions they oversee.\nThe Firm’s CCOR Management policy establishes the CCOR\nManagement Framework for the Firm. The CCOR Management\nFramework is articulated in the Risk Governance and\nOversight Policy which is reviewed and approved by the\nBoard Risk Committee periodically.\nOperational Risk identification\nThe Firm utilizes a structured risk and control self-\nassessment process that is executed by the LOBs and\nCorporate. As part of this process, the LOBs and\nCorporate evaluate the effectiveness of their control\nenvironment to assess where controls have failed, and\nto determine where remediation efforts may be\nrequired. The Firm’s Operational Risk and Compliance\norganization (“Operational Risk and Compliance”)\nprovides oversight of these activities and may also\nperform independent assessments of significant\noperational risk events and areas of concentrated or\nemerging risk.\nOperational Risk Measurement\nOperational Risk and Compliance performs independent\nrisk assessments of the Firm’s operational risks,\nwhich includes assessing the effectiveness of the\ncontrol environment and reporting the results to\nsenior management.\nIn addition, operational risk measurement includes\noperational risk-based capital and operational risk\nloss projections under both baseline and stressed\nconditions.\nThe primary component of the operational risk capital\nestimate is the Loss Distribution Approach (“LDA”)\nstatistical model, which simulates the frequency and\nseverity of future operational risk loss projections\nbased on historical data. The LDA model is used to\nestimate an aggregate operational risk loss over a\none-year time horizon, at a 99.9% confidence level.\nThe LDA model incorporates actual internal operational\nrisk losses in the quarter following the period in\nwhich those losses were realized, and the calculation\ngenerally continues to reflect such losses even after\nthe issues or business activities giving rise to the\nlosses have been remediated or reduced.\nAs required under the Basel III capital framework, the\nFirm’s operational risk-based capital methodology,\nwhich uses the Advanced Measurement Approach (“AMA”),\nincorporates internal and external losses as well as\nmanagement’s view of tail risk captured through\noperational risk scenario analysis, and evaluation of\nkey business environment and internal control metrics.\nThe Firm does not reflect the impact of insurance in\nits AMA estimate of operational risk capital.\nThe Firm considers the impact of stressed economic\nconditions on operational risk losses and develops a\nforward looking view of material operational risk\nevents that may occur in a stressed environment. The\nFirm’s operational risk stress testing framework is\nutilized in calculating results for the Firm’s CCAR\nand other stress testing processes.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management section, on pages\n91-101 for information related to operational risk\nRWA, and CCAR.\nOperational Risk Monitoring and testing\nThe results of risk assessments performed by\nOperational Risk and Compliance are leveraged as one\nof the key criteria in the independent monitoring and\ntesting of the LOBs and Corporate’s compliance with\nlaws and regulation. Through monitoring and testing,\nOperational Risk and Compliance independently identify\nareas of operational risk and tests the effectiveness\nof controls within the LOBs and Corporate.\nManagement of Operational Risk\nThe operational risk areas or issues identified\nthrough monitoring and testing are escalated to the\nLOBs and Corporate to be remediated through action\nplans, as needed, to mitigate operational risk.\nOperational Risk and\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    145\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCompliance may advise the LOBs and Corporate in the\ndevelopment and implementation of action plans.\nOperational Risk Reporting\nEscalation of risks is a fundamental expectation for\nemployees at the Firm. Risks identified by Operational\nRisk and Compliance are escalated to the appropriate\nLOB and Corporate Control Committees, as needed.\nOperational Risk and Compliance has established\nstandards to ensure that consistent operational risk\nreporting and operational risk reports are produced on\na Firmwide basis as well as by the LOBs and Corporate.\nReporting includes the evaluation of key risk\nindicators and key performance indicators against\nestablished thresholds as well as the assessment of\ndifferent types of operational risk against stated\nrisk appetite. The standards reinforce escalation\nprotocols to senior management and to the Board of\nDirectors.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nUnder the CCOR Management Framework, Operational Risk\nand Compliance monitors and assesses COVID-19 related\nlegal and regulatory developments associated with the\nFirm’s financial products and services offered to\nclients and customers as part of the existing change\nmanagement process. The Firm will continue to review\nand assess the impact of the pandemic on operational\nrisk and implement adequate measures as needed.\nSubcategories and examples of operational risks\nOperational risk can manifest itself in various ways.\nOperational risk subcategories such as Compliance\nrisk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and\nModel risk as well as other operational risks, can\nlead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s\noperational risk measurement processes. Refer to pages\n148, 149, 150 and 151, respectively for more\ninformation on Compliance, Conduct, Legal, and\nEstimations and Model risk. Details on other select\nexamples of operational risks are provided below.\nCybersecurity risk\nCybersecurity risk is the risk of the Firm’s exposure\nto harm or loss resulting from misuse or abuse of\ntechnology by malicious actors. Cybersecurity risk is\nan important and continuously evolving focus for the\nFirm. Significant resources are devoted to protecting\nand enhancing the security of computer systems,\nsoftware, networks and other technology assets. The\nFirm’s security efforts are designed to protect\nagainst, among other things, cybersecurity attacks by\nunauthorized parties attempting to obtain access to\nconfidential information, destroy data, disrupt or\ndegrade service, sabotage systems or cause other\ndamage.\nOngoing business expansions may expose the Firm to\npotential new threats as well as expanded regulatory\nscrutiny including the introduction of new\ncybersecurity requirements. The Firm continues to make\nsignificant investments in enhancing its cyber defense\ncapabilities and to strengthen its partnerships with\nthe appropriate government and law enforcement\nagencies and other businesses in order to understand\nthe full spectrum of cybersecurity risks in the\noperating environment, enhance defenses and improve\nresiliency against cybersecurity\nthreats. The Firm actively participates in discussions\nof cybersecurity risks with law enforcement,\ngovernment officials, peer and industry groups, and\nhas significantly increased efforts to educate\nemployees and certain clients on the topic of\ncybersecurity risks.\nThird parties with which the Firm does business or\nthat facilitate the Firm’s business activities (e.g.,\nvendors, supply chain, exchanges, clearing houses,\ncentral depositories, and financial intermediaries)\nare also sources of cybersecurity risk to the Firm.\nThird party cybersecurity incidents such as system\nbreakdowns or failures, misconduct by the employees of\nsuch parties, or cyberattacks could affect their\nability to deliver a product or service to the Firm or\nresult in lost or compromised information of the Firm\nor its clients. Clients are also sources of\ncybersecurity risk to the Firm, particularly when\ntheir activities and systems are beyond the Firm’s own\nsecurity and control systems. As a result, the Firm\nengages in regular and ongoing discussions with\ncertain vendors and clients regarding cybersecurity\nrisks and opportunities to improve security. However,\nwhere cybersecurity incidents occur as a result of\nclient failures to maintain the security of their own\nsystems and processes, clients are responsible for\nlosses incurred.\nTo protect the confidentiality, integrity and\navailability of the Firm’s infrastructure, resources\nand information, the Firm maintains a cybersecurity\nprogram designed to prevent, detect, and respond to\ncyberattacks. The Audit Committee is updated\nperiodically on the Firm’s Information Security\nProgram, recommended changes, cybersecurity policies\nand practices, ongoing efforts to improve security, as\nwell as its efforts regarding significant\ncybersecurity events. In addition, the Firm has a\ncybersecurity incident response plan (“IRP”) designed\nto enable the Firm to respond to attempted\ncybersecurity incidents, coordinate such responses\nwith law enforcement and other government agencies,\nand notify clients and customers, as applicable. Among\nother key focus areas, the IRP is designed to mitigate\nthe risk of insider trading connected to a\ncybersecurity incident, and includes various\nescalation points. Due to the impact of COVID-19, the\nFirm increased the use of remote access and also video\nconferencing solutions provided by third parties to\nfacilitate remote work. As a result the Firm took\nadditional precautionary measures to mitigate\ncybersecurity risks.\nThe Cybersecurity and Technology Control functions are\nresponsible for governance and oversight of the Firm’s\nInformation Security Program. In partnership with the\nFirm’s LOBs and Corporate, the Cybersecurity and\nTechnology Control organization identifies information\nsecurity risk issues and oversees programs for the\ntechnological protection of the Firm’s information\nresources including applications, infrastructure as\nwell as confidential and personal information related\nto the Firm’s customers. The Cybersecurity and\nTechnology organization consists of business aligned\ninformation security managers that are supported\nwithin the organization by the following products that\nexecute the Information Security Program for the Firm:\nCyber Defense & Fraud\n146    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nData Management, Protection & Privacy\nIdentity & Access Management\nGovernance & Controls\nProduction Management & Resiliency\nSoftware & Platform Enablement\nThe Global Cybersecurity and Technology Control\ngovernance structure is designed to identify,\nescalate, and mitigate information security risks.\nThis structure uses key governance forums to\ndisseminate information and monitor technology\nefforts. These forums are established at multiple\nlevels throughout the Firm and include representatives\nfrom each LOB and Corporate. Reports containing\noverviews of key technology risks and efforts to\nenhance related controls are produced for these\nforums, and are reviewed by management at multiple\nlevels. The forums are used to escalate information\nsecurity risks or other matters as appropriate.\nThe IRM function provides oversight of the activities\ndesigned to identify, assess, measure, and mitigate\ncybersecurity risk.\nThe Firm’s Security Awareness Program includes\ntraining that reinforces the Firm's Information\nTechnology Risk and Security Management policies,\nstandards and practices, as well as the expectation\nthat employees comply with these policies. The\nSecurity Awareness Program engages personnel through\ntraining on how to identify potential cybersecurity\nrisks and protect the Firm’s resources and\ninformation. This training is mandatory for all\nemployees globally on a periodic basis, and it is\nsupplemented by Firmwide testing initiatives,\nincluding periodic phishing tests. Finally, the Firm’s\nGlobal Privacy Program requires all employees to take\nperiodic awareness training on data privacy. This\nprivacy-focused training includes information about\nconfidentiality and security, as well as responding to\nunauthorized access to or use of information.\nBusiness and technology resiliency risk\nBusiness disruptions can occur due to forces beyond\nthe Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious\ndiseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or\ntelecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third\nparty to provide expected services, cyberattack,\nflooding, transit strikes, terrorism, health\nemergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees and\ncustomers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide\nresiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to\nrecover its critical business functions and supporting\nassets (i.e., staff, technology and facilities) in the\nevent of a business interruption. The program includes\ngovernance, awareness training, and testing of\nrecovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical\ninitiatives to identify, assess, and manage business\ninterruption and public safety risks. The strength and\nproficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program has\nplayed an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s\nbusiness operations during and after various events.\nPayment fraud risk\nPayment fraud risk is the risk of external and\ninternal parties unlawfully obtaining personal\nmonetary benefit through misdirected or otherwise\nimproper payment. The risk of payment fraud remains at\na heightened level across the industry, particularly\nduring the current COVID-19 pandemic due to the use of\ncontingent forms of payment authentication methods,\nscams involving the pandemic being perpetrated\nincluding an increase in the level of fraud attempts\nagainst consumers. The complexities of these incidents\nand the strategies used by perpetrators continue to\nevolve. The Firm employs various controls for managing\npayment fraud risk as well as providing employee and\nclient education and awareness trainings. The Firm’s\nmonitoring of customer behavior to detect new fraud\nstrategies is periodically evaluated and enhanced in\nan effort to mitigate these fraud risks.\nThird-party outsourcing risk\nThe Firm‘s Third-Party Oversight (“TPO”) and Inter-\naffiliates Oversight (“IAO”) framework assist the LOBs\nand Corporate in selecting, documenting, onboarding,\nmonitoring and managing their supplier relationships\nincluding services provided by affiliates. The\nobjectives of the TPO framework are to hold suppliers\nto a high level of operational performance and to\nmitigate key risks including data loss and business\ndisruption. The Corporate Third-Party Oversight group\nis responsible for Firmwide training, monitoring,\nreporting and standards.\nInsurance\nOne of the ways in which operational risk may be\nmitigated is through insurance maintained by the Firm.\nThe Firm purchases insurance from commercial insurers\nand maintains a wholly-owned captive insurer, Park\nAssurance Company. Insurance may also be required by\nthird parties with whom the Firm does business.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    147\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCOMPLIANCE RISK MANAGEMENT\nCompliance risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk of failing to comply with laws, rules,\nregulations or codes of conduct and standards of self-\nregulatory organizations.\nOverview\nEach LOB and Corporate hold primary ownership of and\naccountability for managing compliance risk. The\nFirm’s Operational Risk and Compliance Organization\n(“Operational Risk and Compliance”), which is\nindependent of the LOBs and Corporate, provides\nindependent review, monitoring and oversight of\nbusiness operations with a focus on compliance with\nthe laws, rules, and regulations applicable to the\ndelivery of the Firm’s products and services to\nclients and customers.\nThese compliance risks relate to a wide variety of\nlaws, rules and regulations depending on the LOB and\nthe jurisdiction, and include risks related to\nfinancial products and services, relationships and\ninteractions with clients and customers, and employee\nactivities. For example, compliance risks include\nthose associated with anti-money laundering\ncompliance, trading activities, market conduct, and\ncomplying with the laws, rules, and regulations\nrelated to the offering of products and services\nacross jurisdictional borders. Compliance risk is also\ninherent in the Firm’s fiduciary activities, including\nthe failure to exercise the applicable standard of\ncare (such as the duties of loyalty or care), to act\nin the best interest of clients and customers or to\ntreat clients and customers fairly.\nOther functions provide oversight of significant\nregulatory obligations that are specific to their\nrespective areas of responsibility.\nOperational Risk and Compliance implements policies\nand standards designed to govern, identify, measure,\nmonitor and test, manage, and report on compliance\nrisk.\nGovernance and oversight\nOperational Risk and Compliance is led by the Firm’s\nGlobal CCO and FRE for Operational Risk.\nThe Firm maintains oversight and coordination of its\ncompliance risk through the implementation of the CCOR\nRisk Management Framework. The Firm’s CCO also\nprovides regular updates to the Audit Committee and t\nhe Board Risk Committee. In certain Special Purpose\nCommittees of the Board have previously been\nestablished to oversee the Firm’s compliance with\nregulatory Consent Orders.\nCode of Conduct\nThe Firm has a Code of Conduct (the “Code”) that sets\nforth the Firm’s expectation that employees will\nconduct themselves with integrity at all times and\nprovides the principles that govern employee conduct\nwith clients, customers, shareholders and one another,\nas well as with the markets and communities in which\nthe Firm does business. The Code requires employees to\npromptly report any potential or actual violation of\nthe Code, any internal Firm policy, or any law or\nregulation applicable to the Firm’s business. It also\nrequires employees to report any illegal conduct, or\nconduct that violates the underlying principles of the\nCode, by any of the Firm’s employees, clients,\ncustomers, suppliers, contract workers, business\npartners, or agents. All newly hired employees are\nassigned Code training and current employees are\nperiodically assigned Code training on an ongoing\nbasis. Employees are required to affirm their\ncompliance with the Code periodically.\nEmployees can report any potential or actual\nviolations of the Code through the JPMC Conduct\nHotline by phone or the internet. The Hotline is\nanonymous, except in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions\nwhere laws prohibit anonymous reporting, and is\navailable at all times globally, with translation\nservices. It is administered by an outside service\nprovider. The Code prohibits retaliation against\nanyone who raises an issue or concern in good faith.\nPeriodically, the Audit Committee receives reports on\nthe Code of Conduct program.\n148    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nCONDUCT RISK MANAGEMENT\nConduct risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is\nthe risk that any action or inaction by an employee or\nemployees could lead to unfair client or customer\noutcomes, impact the integrity of the markets in which\nthe Firm operates, or compromise the Firm’s\nreputation.\nOverview\nEach LOB and Corporate is accountable for identifying\nand managing its conduct risk to provide appropriate\nengagement, ownership and sustainability of a culture\nconsistent with the Firm’s How We Do Business\nPrinciples (the “Principles”). The Principles serve as\na guide for how employees are expected to conduct\nthemselves. With the Principles serving as a guide,\nthe Firm’s Code sets out the Firm’s expectations for\neach employee and provides information and resources\nto help e mployees conduct business ethically and in\ncompliance with the laws everywhere the Firm operates.\nRefer to Compliance Risk Management on page 148 for\nfurther discussion of the Code.\nGovernance and oversight\nThe Conduct Risk Program is governed by the CCOR\nManagement policy, which establishes the framework for\ngovernance, identification, measurement, monitoring\nand testing, management and reporting conduct ris k in\nthe Firm.\nThe Firm has a senior committee that provides\noversight of the Firm’s conduct initiatives to develop\na more holistic view of conduct risks and to connect\nkey programs across the Firm in order to identify\nopportunities and emerging areas of focus. This\ncommittee is responsible for setting overall program\ndirection for strategic enhancements to the Firm's\nemployee conduct framework and review the consolidated\nFirmwide Conduct Risk Appetite Assessment.\nConduct risk management encompasses various aspects of\npeople management practices throughout the employee\nlife cycle, including recruiting, onboarding, training\nand development, performance management, promotion and\ncompensation processes. Each LOB, Treasury and CIO,\nand designated corporate functions completes an\nassessment of conduct risk periodically, reviews\nmetrics and issues which may involve conduct risk, and\nprovides business conduct training as appropriate.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    149\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nLEGAL RISK MANAGEMENT\nLegal risk, a subcategory of operational risk, is the\nrisk of loss primarily caused by the actual or alleged\nfailure to meet legal obligations that arise from the\nrule of law in jurisdictions in which the Firm\noperates, agreements with clients and customers, and\nproducts and services offered by the Firm.\nOverview\nThe global Legal function (“Legal”) provides legal\nservices and advice to the Firm.

The estimation methods are of varying\nlevels of sophistication and are used for many\npurposes, such as the valuation of positions and\nmeasurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital\nrequirements, conducting stress testing, and making\nbusiness decisions. A dedicated independent function,\nModel Risk Governance and Review (“MRGR”), defines and\ngoverns the Firm’s policies relating to the management\nof model risk and risks associated with certain\nanalytical and judgment-based estimations, such as\nthose used in risk management, budget forecasting and\ncapital planning and analysis.\nThe governance of analytical and judgment-based\nestimations within MRGR’s scope follows a consistent\napproach to the approach used for models, which is\ndescribed in detail below.\nModel risks are owned by the users of the models\nwithin the Firm based on the specific purposes of such\nmodels. Users and developers of models are responsible\nfor developing, implementing and testing their models,\nas well as referring models to the MRGR for review and\napproval. Once models have been approved, model users\nand developers are responsible for maintaining a\nrobust operating environment, and must monitor and\nevaluate the performance of the models on an ongoing\nbasis. Model users and developers may seek to enhance\nmodels in response to changes in the portfolios and in\nproduct and market developments, as well as to capture\nimprovements in available modeling techniques and\nsystems capabilities.\nModels are tiered based on an internal standard\naccording to their complexity, the exposure associated\nwith the model and the Firm’s reliance on the model.\nThis tiering is subject to the approval of the MRGR.\nIn its review of a model, the MRGR considers whether\nthe model is suitable for the specific purposes for\nwhich it will be used. When reviewing a model, the\nMRGR analyzes and challenges the model methodology and\nthe reasonableness of model assumptions, and may\nperform or require additional testing, including back-\ntesting of model outcomes. Model reviews are approved\nby the appropriate level of management within the MRGR\nbased on the relevant model tier.\nUnder the Firm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management\nPolicy, the MRGR reviews and approves new models, as\nwell as material changes to existing models, prior to\nimplementation in the operating environment. In\ncertain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the\nFirm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to\nreview or approval. The MRGR may also require the user\nto take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk\nif it is to be used in the interim. These actions will\ndepend on the model and may include, for example,\nlimitation of trading activity.\nWhile models are inherently imprecise, the degree of\nimprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the\nmarket or economic environment. This is particularly\ntrue when the current and forecasted environment is\nsignificantly different from the historical\nmacroeconomic environments upon which the models were\ntrained, as the Firm has experienced during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a\ngreater degree of judgment and analytics to inform\nadjustments to model outputs than in typical periods.\nRefer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used by the\nFirm on pages 152-155 and Note 2 for a summary of\nmodel-based valuations and other valuation techniques.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    151\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM\nJPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of\nestimates are integral to understanding its reported\nresults. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates\nrequire management’s judgment to ascertain the\nappropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm has established policies and control\nprocedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,\nincluding any judgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently reviewed and\napplied consistently from period to period. The\nmethods used and judgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and\nthe related business and risk management strategies,\nwhich may vary across the Firm’s businesses and\nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures\nare intended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description of\nthe Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses comprises:\nThe allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\nThe allowance for lending-related commitments, and\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS\nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant\njudgment on a number of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,\nincorporation of historical loss experience,\nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and the\ndetermination of remaining expected life. Refer to\nNote 10 and Note 13 for further information on these\njudgments as well as the Firm’s policies and\nmethodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance\nfor credit losses.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for\nexposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty\nvariables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses of each\nportfolio vary by portfolio and geography.\nKey MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, house price index (“HPI”) and U.S. real\ngross domestic product (“GDP”).\nKey MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nreal GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices,\ncorporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real\nestate prices and HPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at\nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes\nin the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor\nmarket and weak overall economic conditions that will\ncontinue to affect borrowers across the Firm’s\nconsumer and wholesale lending portfolios. Significant\njudgment is required to estimate the severity and\nduration of the current economic downturn, as well as\nits potential impact on borrower defaults and loss\nseverities. In particular, macroeconomic conditions\nand forecasts regarding the duration and severity of\nthe economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic\nhave been rapidly changing and remain highly\nuncertain. It is difficult to predict exactly how\nborrower behavior will be impacted by these changes in\neconomic conditions. The effectiveness of government\nsupport, customer assistance and enhanced unemployment\nbenefits should act as mitigants to credit losses, but\nthe extent of the mitigation impact remains uncertain.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in\nany one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may not occur at the\nsame rate and may not be consistent across all\ngeographies or product types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such\nthat improvement in one factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its central and\nrelative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are\ntwo of the five scenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but\ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of\nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod.\nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario\ndescribed on page 132 and in Note 13, the Firm’s\nrelative adverse scenario assumes a significantly\nelevated U.S. unemployment rate throughout 2021,\naveraging 3.0% higher over the eight-quarter forecast,\nwith a peak difference of approximately 4.0% in the\nsecond quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real GDP with a\nslower recovery,\n152    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nremaining nearly 2.6% lower at the end of the eight-\nquarter forecast, with a peak difference of nearly\n4.1% in the third quarter of 2021; and a 10.1% further\ndeterioration in the national HPI with a trough in the\nfirst quarter of 2022. This analysis is not intended\nto estimate expected future changes in the allowance\nfor credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:\nthe Firm has placed significant weight on its\nadverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for\ncredit losses as of December 31, 2020 , and\naccordingly, the existing allowance already reflects\ncredit losses beyond those estimated under the central\nscenario • the impacts of changes in many MEVs are\nboth interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of\nthis analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more\nsevere changes in macroeconomic variables • the\nCOVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs at a speed\nand to degrees not seen in recent history, adding\nsignificantly higher degrees of uncertainty around\nmodeled credit loss estimations • significant changes\nin the expected severity and duration of the economic\ndownturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects\nof government support and customer assistance, and the\nspeed of the subsequent recovery could significantly\naffect the Firm’s estimate of expected credit losses\nirrespective of the estimated sensitivities described\nbelow. Without considering the additional weight the\nFirm has placed on its adverse scenarios or any other\noffsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative\ncomponents of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nfor the lending exposures noted below, the difference\nbetween the modeled estimates under the Firm’s\nrelative adverse and central scenarios at December 31,\n2020 would result in the following: • An increase of\napproximately $700 million for residential real estate\nloans and lending-related commitments • An increase of\napproximately $5.1 billion for credit card loans • An\nincrease of approximately $2.8 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related commitments This analysis\nrelates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and\nis not intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime\nloss estimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,\nparticularly in light of the recent economic\nconditions, the Firm believes that its process to\nconsider the available information and associated\nrisks and\nuncertainties is appropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses were reasonable\nand appropriate for the period ended December 31, 2020\n. Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of\nsuch assets and liabilities are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis, including, derivatives and\nstructured note products. Certain assets and\nliabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home\nequity and other loans, where the carrying value is\nbased on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nAssets measured at fair value The following table\nincludes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and\nthe portion of such assets that are classified within\nlevel 3 of the valuation hierarchy.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied, including the\nnetting benefit associated with cash collateral.\nValuation Details of the Firm’s processes for\ndetermining fair value are set out in Note 2.\nEstimating fair value requires the application of\njudgment. The type and level of judgment required is\nlargely dependent on the amount of observable market\ninformation available to the Firm. For instruments\nvalued using internally developed valuation models and\nother valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified\nwithin level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments\nused to estimate fair value are more significant than\nthose required when estimating the fair value of\ninstruments classified within levels 1 and 2.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    153\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess all relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates,\nprepayment speed, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as commodity, equity or\ndebt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to\nNote 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs\nused.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The judgments made are\ntypically affected by the type of product and its\nspecific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity\nfor the product or within the market as a whole. In\nperiods of heightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the\nwider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs\nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while\nthe Firm believes its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those of other market\nparticipants, the methods and assumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may vary across the Firm’s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in\nthe determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different estimate of\nfair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for\na detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process\nand hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\nGoodwill impairment\nUnder U.S. GAAP, goodwill must be allocated to\nreporting units and tested for impairment at least\nannually. The Firm’s process and methodology used to\nconduct goodwill impairment testing is described in\nNote 15.\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing\ngoodwill for impairment. The goodwill associated with\neach business combination is allocated to the related\nreporting units for goodwill impairment testing.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Firm\nreviewed current economic conditions, including the\npotential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business\nperformance, estimated market cost of equity, as well\nas actual business results and projections of business\nperformance for all its reporting units. The Firm has\nconcluded that the goodwill allocated to its reporting\nunits was not impaired as of December 31, 2020. The\nfair values of these reporting units exceeded their\ncarrying values by at least 15% and did not indicate a\nsignificant risk of goodwill impairment based on\ncurrent projections and valuations.\nThe projections for all of the Firm’s reporting units\nare consistent with management’s current business\noutlook assumptions in the short term, and the Firm’s\nbest estimates of long-term growth and return on\nequity in the longer term. Where possible, the Firm\nuses third-party and peer data to benchmark its\nassumptions and estimates.\nRefer to Note 15 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment\nas of December 31, 2020.\nCredit card rewards liability\nJPMorgan Chase offers credit cards with various\nrewards programs which allow cardholders to earn\nrewards points based on their account activity and the\nterms and conditions of the rewards program.\nGenerally, there are no limits on the points that an\neligible cardholder can earn, nor do the points\nexpire, and the points can be redeemed for a variety\nof rewards, including cash (predominantly in the form\nof account credits), gift cards and travel. The Firm\nmaintains a rewards liability which represents the\nestimated cost of rewards points earned and expected\nto be redeemed by cardholders. The liability is\naccrued as the cardholder earns the benefit and is\nreduced when the cardholder redeems points. This\nliability was $7.7 billion and $6.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is\nrecorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets.\nThe rewards liability is sensitive to redemption rate\n(“RR”) and cost per point (“CPP”) assumptions. The RR\nassumption is used to estimate the number of points\nearned by customers that will be redeemed over the\nlife of the account. The CPP assumption is used to\nestimate the cost of future point redemptions. These\nassumptions are evaluated periodically considering\nhistorical actuals and cardholder redemption behavior\nand updates to them will impact the rewards liability.\nAs of December 31, 2020, a combined increase of 25\nbasis points in RR and 1 basis point in CPP would\nincrease the rewards liability by approximately $215\nmillion.\nIncome taxes\nJPMorgan Chase is subject to the income tax laws of\nthe various jurisdictions in which it operates,\nincluding U.S. federal, state and local, and non-U.S.\njurisdictions. These laws are often complex and may be\nsubject to different interpretations. To determine the\nfinancial statement impact of accounting for income\ntaxes, including the provision for income tax expense\nand unrecognized tax benefits, JPMorgan Chase must\nmake assumptions and judgments about how to interpret\nand apply these complex tax laws to numerous\ntransactions and business events, as well as make\njudgments regarding the timing of when\n154    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\ncertain items may affect taxable income in the U.S.\nand non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\nJPMorgan Chase’s interpretations of tax laws around\nthe world are subject to review and examination by the\nvarious taxing authorities in the jurisdictions where\nthe Firm operates, and disputes may occur regarding\nits view on a tax position. These disputes over\ninterpretations with the various taxing authorities\nmay be settled by audit, administrative appeals or\nadjudication in the court systems of the tax\njurisdictions in which the Firm operates. JPMorgan\nChase regularly reviews whether it may be assessed\nadditional income taxes as a result of the resolution\nof these matters, and the Firm records additional\nreserves as appropriate. In addition, the Firm may\nrevise its estimate of income taxes due to changes in\nincome tax laws, legal interpretations, and business\nstrategies. It is possible that revisions in the\nFirm’s estimate of income taxes may materially affect\nthe Firm’s results of operations in any reporting\nperiod.\nThe Firm’s provision for income taxes is composed of\ncurrent and deferred taxes. Deferred taxes arise from\ndifferences between assets and liabilities measured\nfor financial reporting versus income tax return\npurposes. Deferred tax assets are recognized if, in\nmanagement’s judgment, their realizability is\ndetermined to be more likely than not. The Firm has\nalso recognized deferred tax assets in connection with\ncertain tax attributes, including net operating loss\n(“NOL”) carryforwards and foreign tax credit (“FTC”)\ncarryforwards. The Firm performs regular reviews to\nascertain whether its deferred tax assets are\nrealizable. These reviews include management’s\nestimates and assumptions regarding future taxable\nincome, which also incorporates various tax planning\nstrategies, including strategies that may be available\nto utilize NOLs before they expire. In connection with\nthese reviews, if it is determined that a deferred tax\nasset is not realizable, a valuation allowance is\nestablished. The valuation allowance may be reversed\nin a subsequent reporting period if the Firm\ndetermines that, based on revised estimates of future\ntaxable income or changes in tax planning strategies,\nit is more likely than not that all or part of the\ndeferred tax asset will become realizable. As of\nDecember 31, 2020, management has determined it is\nmore likely than not that the Firm will realize its\ndeferred tax assets, net of the existing valuation\nallowance.\nThe Firm adjusts its unrecognized tax benefits as\nnecessary when additional information becomes\navailable. Uncertain tax positions that meet the more-\nlikely-than-not recognition threshold are measured to\ndetermine the amount of benefit to recognize. An\nuncertain tax position is measured at the largest\namount of benefit that management believes is more\nlikely than not to be realized upon settlement. It is\npossible that the reassessment of JPMorgan Chase’s\nunrecognized tax benefits may have a material impact\non its effective income tax rate in the period in\nwhich the reassessment occurs.\nRefer to Note 25 for additional information on income\ntaxes.\nLitigation reserves\nRefer to Note 30 for a description of the significant\nestimates and judgments associated with establishing\nlitigation reserves.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    155\nManagement’s discussion and analysis\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nFinancial Accounting Standards\nBoard\n(“FASB”) Standards Adopted since\nJanuary\n1, 2020\nStandard                              Summary of guidance                    Effects on financial statements\nEstablishes a single allowance\nframework for all financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost and\ncertain off-balance sheet credit\nexposures.

(“JPMorgan Chase”\nor the “Firm”) is responsible for establishing and\nmaintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. Internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed by, or under the supervision of,\nthe Firm’s principal executive and principal financial\nofficers, or persons performing similar functions, and\neffected by JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors,\nmanagement and other personnel, to provide reasonable\nassurance regarding the reliability of financial\nreporting and the preparation of financial statements\nfor external purposes in accordance with accounting\nprinciples generally accepted in the United States of\nAmerica (“U.S. GAAP”).\nJPMorgan Chase’s internal control over financial\nreporting includes those policies and procedures that\n(1) pertain to the maintenance of records, that, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the\ntransactions and dispositions of the Firm’s assets;\n(2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are\nrecorded as necessary to permit preparation of\nfinancial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and\nthat receipts and expenditures of the Firm are being\nmade only in accordance with authorizations of\nJPMorgan Chase’s management and directors; and (3)\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or\ntimely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or\ndisposition of the Firm’s assets that could have a\nmaterial effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Management has completed an assessment of\nthe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making\nthe assessment, management used the “Internal Control\n— Integrated Framework” (“COSO 2013”) promulgated by\nthe Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (“COSO”).\nBased upon the assessment performed, management\nconcluded that as of December 31, 2020, JPMorgan\nChase’s internal control over financial reporting was\neffective based upon the COSO 2013 framework.\nAdditionally, based upon management’s assessment, the\nFirm determined that there were no material weaknesses\nin its internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThe effectiveness of the Firm’s internal control over\nfinancial reporting as of December 31, 2020, has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent\nregistered public accounting firm, as stated in their\nreport which appears herein.\nJames Dimon\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\nJennifer Piepszak\nExecutive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nFebruary 23, 2021\n158    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan\nChase & Co.:\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal\nControl over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheets of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries\n(the “Firm”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the\nrelated consolidated statements of income,\ncomprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity\nand cash flows for each of the three years in the\nperiod ended December 31, 2020, including the related\nnotes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated\nfinancial statements”). We also have audited the\nFirm’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nDecember 31, 2020, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued\nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the\nTreadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements\nreferred to above present fairly, in all material\nrespects, the financial position of the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three\nyears in the period ended December 31, 2020 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America. Also in our\nopinion, the Firm maintained, in all material\nrespects, effective internal control over financial\nreporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control – Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChange in Accounting Principle\nAs discussed in Note 1 and Note 13 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm changed the manner in\nwhich it accounts for credit losses on certain\nfinancial instruments in 2020.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Firm’s management is responsible for these\nconsolidated financial statements, for maintaining\neffective internal control over financial reporting,\nand for its assessment of the effectiveness of\ninternal control over financial reporting, included in\nthe accompanying Management’s report on internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Our responsibility\nis to express opinions on the Firm’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Firm’s internal\ncontrol over financial reporting based on our audits.\nWe are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United\nStates) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent\nwith respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the\nstandards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that\nwe plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance\nabout whether the consolidated financial statements\nare free of material misstatement, whether due to\nerror or fraud, and whether effective internal control\nover financial reporting was maintained in all\nmaterial respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements\nincluded performing procedures to assess the risks of\nmaterial misstatement of the consolidated financial\nstatements, whether due to error or fraud, and\nperforming procedures that respond to those risks.\nSuch procedures included examining, on a test basis,\nevidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audits also\nincluded evaluating the accounting principles used and\nsignificant estimates made by management, as well as\nevaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of\ninternal control over financial reporting included\nobtaining an understanding of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, assessing the risk that a\nmaterial weakness exists, and testing and evaluating\nthe design and operating effectiveness of internal\ncontrol based on the assessed risk. Our audits also\nincluded performing such other procedures as we\nconsidered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our\nopinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over\nFinancial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting\nis a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and\nthe preparation of financial statements for external\npurposes in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles. A company’s internal control\nover financial reporting includes those policies and\nprocedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of\nrecords that, in reasonable detail, accurately and\nfairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of\nthe assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary\nto permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples, and that receipts and expenditures of the\ncompany are being made only in accordance with\nauthorizations of management and directors of the\ncompany; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance\nregarding prevention or timely detection of\nunauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the\ncompany’s assets that could have a material effect on\nthe financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control\nover financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of\neffectiveness to future periods are subject to the\nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of\nchanges in conditions, or that the degree of\ncompliance with the policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP300 Madison AvenueNew\nYork, NY 10017\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    159\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are\nmatters arising from the current period audit of the\nconsolidated financial statements that were\ncommunicated or required to be communicated to the\naudit committee and that: (i) relate to accounts or\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The\ncommunication of critical audit matters does not alter\nin any way our opinion on the consolidated financial\nstatements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below,\nproviding separate opinions on the critical audit\nmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which\nthey relate.\nAllowance for Loan Losses – Portfolio-based component\nof Wholesale Loan and Credit Card Loan Portfolios\nAs described in Note 13 to the consolidated financial\nstatements, the allowance for loan losses for the\nportfolio-based component of the wholesale and credit\ncard loan portfolios was $23.4 billion on total\nportfolio-based retained loans of $653.4 billion at\nDecember 31, 2020. The Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses represents management’s estimate of expected\ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of the\nFirm's loan portfolios and considers expected future\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions. The portfolio-\nbased component of the Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses for the wholesale and credit card retained loan\nportfolios begins with a quantitative calculation of\nexpected credit losses over the expected life of the\nloan by applying credit loss factors to the estimated\nexposure at default. The credit loss factors applied\nare determined based on the weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios that take\ninto consideration the Firm's economic outlook as\nderived through forecast macroeconomic variables, the\nmost significant of which are U.S. unemployment and\nU.S. real gross domestic product. This quantitative\ncalculation is further adjusted to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the allowance\nfor loan losses for the portfolio-based component of\nthe wholesale and credit card loan portfolios is a\ncritical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nand estimation by management in the forecast of\nmacroeconomic variables, specifically U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product, as\nthe Firm’s forecasts of economic conditions\nsignificantly affect its estimate of expected credit\nlosses at the balance sheet date, (ii) the significant\njudgment and estimation by management in determining\nthe quantitative calculation utilized in their credit\nloss estimates and the adjustments to take into\nconsideration model imprecision, emerging risk\nassessments, trends and other subjective factors that\nare not yet otherwise reflected in the credit loss\nestimate, which both in turn led to a high degree of\nauditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in\nperforming procedures and in evaluating audit evidence\nobtained relating to the credit\nloss estimates and the appropriateness of the\nadjustments to the credit loss estimates, and (iii)\nthe audit effort involved professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the audit evidence.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s allowance for loan losses, including controls\nover model validation and generation of macroeconomic\nscenarios. These procedures also included, among\nothers, testing management’s process for estimating\nthe allowance for loan losses, which involved (i)\nevaluating the appropriateness of the models and\nmethodologies used in quantitative calculations; (ii)\nevaluating the reasonableness of forecasts of U.S.\nunemployment and U.S. real gross domestic product;\n(iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data\nused in the estimate; and (iv) evaluating the\nreasonableness of management’s adjustments to the\nquantitative output for the impacts of model\nimprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and\nother subjective factors that are not yet otherwise\nreflected in the credit loss estimate. These\nprocedures also included the use of professionals with\nspecialized skill and knowledge to assist in\nevaluating the appropriateness of certain models,\nmethodologies and macroeconomic variables .\nFair Value of Certain Level 3 Financial Instruments\nAs described in Notes 2 and 3 to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, the Firm carries $1.2 trillion\nof its assets and $437.6 billion of its liabilities at\nfair value on a recurring basis. Included in these\nbalances are $10.3 billion of trading assets and $41.5\nbillion of liabilities measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, collectively financial instruments,\nwhich are classified as level 3 as they contain one or\nmore inputs to valuation which are unobservable and\nsignificant to their fair value measurement. The Firm\nutilized internally developed valuation models and\nunobservable inputs to estimate fair value of the\nlevel 3 financial instruments. The unobservable inputs\nused by management to estimate the fair value of\ncertain of these financial instruments include forward\nequity prices, volatility relating to interest rates\nand equity prices and correlation relating to interest\nrates, equity prices, credit and foreign exchange\nrates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination\nthat performing procedures relating to the fair value\nof certain level 3 financial instruments is a critical\naudit matter are (i) the significant judgment and\nestimation by management in determining the inputs to\nestimate fair value, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort\nin performing procedures related to the fair value of\nthese financial instruments, and (ii) the audit effort\ninvolved professionals with specialized skill and\nknowledge to assist in evaluating the audit evidence\nobtained from these procedures.\n160    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting\nFirm\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures\nand evaluating audit evidence in connection with\nforming our overall opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements. These procedures included\ntesting the effectiveness of controls relating to the\nFirm’s processes for determining fair value which\ninclude controls over models, inputs, and data. These\nprocedures also included, among others, the\ninvolvement of professionals with specialized skill\nand knowledge to assist in developing an independent\nestimate of fair value for a sample of these financial\ninstruments.

Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\nThe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements are an integral part of these statements.\n166    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 1 – Basis of presentation\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law\nin 1968, is a leading global financial services firm in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader\nin investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial\ntransaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business\nsegments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.\nGAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by\nregulatory authorities. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the\ncurrent presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase\nand other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not\nassets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it\nhas a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest\nentity or a variable interest entity. Voting interest entities Voting interest entities are entities that have\nsufficient equity and provide the equity investors voting rights that enable them to make significant decisions\nrelating to the entity’s operations. For these types of entities, the Firm’s determination of whether it has a\ncontrolling interest is primarily based on the amount of voting equity interests held. Entities in which the Firm\nhas a controlling financial interest, through ownership of the majority of the entities’ voting equity interests,\nor through other contractual rights that give the Firm control, are consolidated by the Firm. Investments in\ncompanies in which the Firm has significant influence over operating and financing decisions (but does not own a\nmajority of the voting equity interests) are accounted for (i) in accordance with the equity method of accounting\n(which requires the Firm to recognize its proportionate share of the entity’s net earnings), or (ii) at fair value\nif the fair value option was elected. These investments are generally included in other assets, with income or loss\nincluded in noninterest revenue. Certain Firm-sponsored asset management funds are structured as limited\npartnerships or limited liability companies. For many of these entities, the Firm is the general partner or\nmanaging member, but the non-affiliated partners or members have the ability to remove the Firm as the general\npartner or managing member without cause (i.e., kick-out rights), based on a simple majority vote, or the non-\naffiliated partners or members have rights to participate in important decisions. Accordingly, the Firm does not\nconsolidate these voting interest entities. However, in the limited cases where the non-managing partners or\nmembers do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights, the Firm evaluates the funds as VIEs and\nconsolidates the funds if the Firm is t h e general partner or managing member and has a potentially significant\ninterest. The Firm’s investment companies and asset management funds have investments in both publicly-held and\nprivately-held entities, including investments in buyouts, growth equity and venture opportunities. These\ninvestments are accounted for under investment company guidelines and, accordingly, irrespective of the percentage\nof equity ownership interests held, are carried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value, and are recorded\nin other assets, with income or loss included in noninterest revenue. If consolidated, the Firm retains the\naccounting under such specialized investment company guidelines. Variable interest entities VIEs are entities that,\nby design, either (1) lack sufficient equity to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional\nsubordinated financial support from other parties, or (2) have equity investors that do not have the ability to\nmake significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights, or do not have the obligation\nto absorb the expected losses, or do not have the right to receive the residual returns of the entity. The most\ncommon type of VIE is an SPE. SPEs are commonly used in securitization transactions in order to isolate certain\nassets and distribute the cash flows from those assets to investors. The basic SPE structure involves a company\nselling assets to the SPE; the SPE funds the purchase of those assets by issuing securities to investors. The legal\ndocuments that govern the transaction specify how the cash earned on the assets must be allocated to the SPE’s\ninvestors and other parties that have rights to those cash flows. SPEs are generally structured to insulate\ninvestors from claims on the SPE’s assets by creditors of other entities, including the creditors of the seller of\nthe assets. The primary beneficiary of a VIE (i.e., the party that has a controlling financial interest) is\nrequired to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the VIE. The primary beneficiary is the party that has both\n(1) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance;\nand (2) through its interests in the VIE, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the\nVIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. To assess whether the Firm has the power to direct the\nactivities of a VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, the Firm considers all the facts\nand\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    167\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\ncircumstances, including its role in establishing the VIE and its ongoing rights and responsibilities. This\nassessment includes, first, identifying the activities that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic\nperformance; and second, identifying which party, if any, has power over those activities. In general, the parties\nthat make the most significant decisions affecting the VIE (such as asset managers, collateral managers, servicers,\nor owners of call options or liquidation rights over the VIE’s assets) or have the right to unilaterally remove\nthose decision-makers are deemed to have the power to direct the activities of a VIE. To assess whether the Firm\nhas the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially\nbe significant to the VIE, the Firm considers all of its economic interests, including debt and equity investments,\nservicing fees, and derivatives or other arrangements deemed to be variable interests in the VIE. This assessment\nrequires that the Firm apply judgment in determining whether these interests, in the aggregate, are considered\npotentially significant to the VIE. Factors considered in assessing significance include: the design of the VIE,\nincluding its capitalization structure; subordination of interests; payment priority; relative share of interests\nheld across various classes within the VIE’s capital structure; and the reasons why the interests are held by the\nFirm. The Firm performs on-going reassessments of: (1) whether entities previously evaluated under the majority\nvoting-interest framework have become VIEs, based on certain events, and are therefore subject to the VIE\nconsolidation framework; and (2) whether changes in the facts and circumstances regarding the Firm’s involvement\nwith a VIE cause the Firm’s consolidation conclusion to change. Refer to Note 14 for further discussion of the\nFirm’s VIEs. Revenue recognition Interest income The Firm recognizes interest income on loans, debt securities, and\nother debt instruments, generally on a level-yield basis, based on the underlying contractual rate. Refer to Note 7\nfor further discussion of interest income. Revenue from contracts with customers JPMorgan Chase recognizes\nnoninterest revenue from certain contracts with customers , in investment banking fees, deposit-related fees, asset\nmanagement administration and commissions, and components of card income, when the Firm’s related performance\nobligations are satisfied. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of the Firm’s revenue from contracts with\ncustomers. Principal transactions revenue JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair\nvalue. Changes in fair value are reported primarily in principal transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for\nfurther discussion of fair value measurement. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion of principal transactions\nrevenue. Use of estimates in the preparation of consolidated financial statements The preparation of the\nConsolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported\namounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.\nActual results could be different from these estimates. Foreign currency translation JPMorgan Chase revalues\nassets, liabilities, revenue and expense denominated in non-U.S. currencies into U.S. dollars using applicable\nexchange rates. Gains and losses relating to translating functional currency financial statements for U.S.\nreporting are included in the Consolidated statements of comprehensive income. Gains and losses relating to\nnonfunctional currency transactions, including non-U.S. operations where the functional currency is the U.S.\ndollar, are reported in the Consolidated statements of income. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits\nentities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash\ncollateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase agreements\nand securities borrowed or loaned under securities loan agreements to be presented net when specified conditions\nare met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net\nsuch balances when the specified conditions are met. The Firm uses master netting agreements to mitigate\ncounterparty credit risk in certain transactions, including derivative contracts, resale, repurchase, securities\nborrowed and securities loaned agreements. A master netting agreement is a single agreement with a counterparty\nthat permits multiple transactions governed by that agreement to be terminated or accelerated and settled through a\nsingle payment in a single currency in the event of a default (e.g., bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment\nor securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin when due). Upon the exercise of derivatives termination\nrights by the non-defaulting party (i) all transactions are terminated, (ii) all transactions are valued and the\npositive values of “in the money” transactions are netted against the negative values of “out of the money”\ntransactions and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of one of the parties to pay the netted termination\namount. Upon exercise of default rights under repurchase agreements and securities loan agreements in general (i)\nall transactions are terminated and accelerated, (ii) all values of securities or cash held or to be delivered are\ncalculated, and all such sums are netted against each other and (iii) the only remaining payment obligation is of\none of the parties to pay the netted termination amount.\n168    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nTypical master netting agreements for these types of\ntransactions also often contain a collateral/margin\nagreement that provides for a security interest in, or\ntitle transfer of, securities or cash\ncollateral/margin to the party that has the right to\ndemand margin (the “demanding party”). The\ncollateral/margin agreement typically requires a party\nto transfer collateral/margin to the demanding party\nwith a value equal to the amount of the margin deficit\non a net basis across all transactions governed by the\nmaster netting agreement, less any threshold. The\ncollateral/margin agreement grants to the demanding\nparty, upon default by the counterparty, the right to\nset-off any amounts payable by the counterparty\nagainst any posted collateral or the cash equivalent\nof any posted collateral/margin. It also grants to the\ndemanding party the right to liquidate\ncollateral/margin and to apply the proceeds to an\namount payable by the counterparty.

Refer to Note 11 for further discussion\nof the Firm’s securities financing agreements.\nStatements of cash flows For JPMorgan Chase’s\nConsolidated statements of cash flows, cash is defined\nas those amounts included in cash and due from banks\nand deposits with banks. Accounting standard adopted\nJanuary 1, 2020 Financial Instruments – Credit Losses\n(“CECL”) The adoption of this guidance established a\nsingle allowance framework for all financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost and certain off-balance\nsheet credit exposures. This framework requires that\nmanagement’s estimate reflects credit losses over the\ninstrument’s remaining expected life and considers\nexpected future changes in macroeconomic conditions.\nRefer to Note 13 for further information. Prior to the\nadoption of the CECL accounting guidance, the Firm’s\nallowance for credit losses represented management’s\nestimate of probable credit losses inherent in the\nFirm’s retained loan portfolios and certain lending-\nrelated commitments.\nThe following table presents the impacts to the allowance for credit losses and retained earnings upon adoption of\nthis guidance on January 1, 2020:\n(in billions)                            December 31, 2019       CECL adoption impact       January 1, 2020\nAllowance for credit losses\nConsumer, excluding credit card(a)    $                2.6    $                   0.4    $              3.0\nCredit card                                            5.7                        5.5                  11.2\nWholesale(a)                                           6.0                       -1.6                   4.4\nFirmwide                              $               14.3    $                   4.3    $             18.6\nRetained earnings\nFirmwide allowance increase                                   $                   4.3\nBalance sheet reclassification(b)                                                -0.8\nTotal pre-tax impact                                                              3.5\nTax effect                                                                       -0.8\nDecrease to retained earnings                                 $                   2.7\n(a) In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated business banking and auto dealer\nloans and lending-related commitments held in CCB from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the\nwholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period\namounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Accordingly, $ 0.6billion of the allowance for\ncredit losses at December 31, 2019 and $( 0.2) billion of the CECL adoption impact were reclassified.\n(b) Represents the recognition of the nonaccretable difference on purchased credit deteriorated loans and the\nFirm's election to recognize the reserve for uncollectible accrued interest on credit card loans in the allowance,\nboth of which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans.\nSecurities Financing Agreements\nAs permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements.\nThe difference between their carrying amount and fair value was immaterial and was recorded as part of the Firm’s\ncumulative-effect adjustment. Refer to Note 11 for further information.\nInvestment securities\nUpon adoption, HTM securities are presented net of an\nallowance for credit losses. The guidance also amended the\nprevious other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) model\nfor AFS securities to incorporate an allowance. Refer to\nNote 10 for further information.\nCredit quality disclosures\nAs a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm\nexpanded credit quality disclosures for financial assets\nmeasured at amortized cost particularly within the retained\nloan portfolios. Refer to Note 12 for further information.\nPCD loans\nThe adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI\nloans, which are considered purchased credit deteriorated\n(“PCD”) loans under CECL. Upon adoption, the Firm\nrecognized the nonaccretable difference on PCD loans in\nthe allowance, which resulted in a corresponding increase\nto loans. PCD loans are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual and\ncharge-off policies and are now reported in the consumer,\nexcluding credit card portfolio’s residential real estate loan\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    169\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nclass. Refer to Note 12 for further information.\nChanges in credit portfolio segments and classes In\nconjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm\nreclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related\ncommitments from the consumer excluding credit card\nportfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment,\nto align with the methodology applied when determining\nthe allowance. The Firm also revised its loan classes.\nPrior- period amounts have been revised to conform\nwith the current presentation. Refer to Note 12 for\nfurther information. Accrued interest receivables As\npermitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to\ncontinue classifying accrued interest on loans,\nincluding accrued but unbilled interest on credit card\nloans, and investment securities in accrued interest\nand accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once\nbilled is then recognized in the loan balances, with\nthe related allowance recorded in the allowance for\ncredit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit\nlosses on accrued interest on credit card loans are\nrecognized in the provision for credit losses and\ncharge-offs are recognized by reversing interest\nincome. For other loans and securities, the Firm\ngenerally does not recognize an allowance for credit\nlosses on accrued interest receivables, consistent\nwith its policy to write them off no later than 90\ndays past due by reversing interest income. Capital\ntransition provisions As permitted under the U.S.\ncapital rules issued by the federal banking agencies\nin 2019, the Firm initially elected to phase-in the\nJanuary 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to\nretained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at\n25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their\nresponse to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on\nMarch 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an\ninterim final rule (issued as final on August 26,\n2020) that provided the option to delay the effects of\nCECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by\na three-year transition period (“CECL capital\ntransition provisions”). Refer to Note 27 for further\ninformation. Accounting standards adopted January 1,\n2018 Effective January 1, 2018, the Firm adopted\nseveral accounting standards resulting in a net\ndecrease of $ 183million to retained earnings and a\nnet increase of $ 88million to AOCI. The adoption of\nthe recognition and measurement guidance resulted in $\n505million of fair value gains in the first quarter of\n2018, recorded in total net revenue, on certain equity\ninvestments that were previously held at cost.\nSignificant accounting policies\nThe following table identifies JPMorgan Chase’s other\nsignificant accounting policies and the Note and page\nwhere a detailed description of each policy can be\nfound.\nFair value measurement                    Note 2     page 171\nFair value option                         Note 3     page 192\nDerivative instruments                    Note 5     page 198\nNoninterest revenue and noninterest       Note 6     page 212\nexpense\nInterest income and Interest expense      Note 7     page 215\nPension and other postretirement          Note 8     page 216\nemployee benefit plans\nEmployee share-based incentives           Note 9     page 221\nInvestment securities                     Note 10    page 223\nSecurities financing activities           Note 11    page 229\nLoans                                     Note 12    page 232\nAllowance for credit losses               Note 13    page 248\nVariable interest entities                Note 14    page 253\nGoodwill and Mortgage servicing rights    Note 15    page 261\nPremises and equipment                    Note 16    page 265\nLeases                                    Note 18    page 266\nLong-term debt                            Note 20    page 269\nEarnings per share                        Note 23    page 274\nIncome taxes                              Note 25    page 277\nOff–balance sheet lending-related\nfinancial instruments, guarantees and     Note 28    page 283\nother commitments\nLitigation                                Note 30    page 290\n170    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNote 2 – Fair value measurement\nJPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its assets and\nliabilities at fair value. These assets and\nliabilities are predominantly carried at fair value on\na recurring basis (i.e., assets and liabilities that\nare measured and reported at fair value on the Firm’s\nConsolidated balance sheets). Certain assets,\nliabilities and unfunded lending-related commitments\nare measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis;\nthat is, they are not measured at fair value on an\nongoing basis but are subject to fair value\nadjustments only in certain circumstances (for\nexample, when there is evidence of impairment). Fair\nvalue is defined as the price that would be received\nto sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an\norderly transaction between market participants at the\nmeasurement date. Fair value is based on quoted market\nprices or inputs, where available. If prices or quotes\nare not available, fair value is based on valuation\nmodels and other valuation techniques that consider\nrelevant transaction characteristics (such as\nmaturity) and use, as inputs, observable or\nunobservable market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, prices (such as\ncommodity, equity or debt prices), correlations,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Valuation\nadjustments may be made to ensure that financial\ninstruments are recorded at fair value, as described\nbelow. The level of precision in estimating\nunobservable market inputs or other factors can affect\nthe amount of gain or loss recorded for a particular\nposition. Furthermore, while the Firm believes its\nvaluation methods are appropriate and consistent with\nthose of other market participants, the methods and\nassumptions used reflect management judgment and may\nvary across the Firm’s businesses and portfolios. The\nFirm uses various methodologies and assumptions in the\ndetermination of fair value. The use of different\nmethodologies or assumptions by other market\nparticipants compared with those used by the Firm\ncould result in the Firm deriving a different estimate\nof fair value at the reporting date. Valuation process\nRisk-taking functions are responsible for providing\nfair value estimates for assets and liabilities\ncarried on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair\nvalue. The Firm’s VCG, which is part of the Firm’s\nFinance function and independent of the risk-taking\nfunctions, is responsible for verifying these\nestimates and determining any fair value adjustments\nthat may be required to ensure that the Firm’s\npositions are recorded at fair value. The VGF is\ncomposed of senior finance and risk executives and is\nresponsible for overseeing the management of risks\narising from valuation activities conducted across the\nFirm. The Firmwide VGF is chaired by the Firmwide head\nof the VCG (under the direction of the Firm’s\nController), and includes sub-forums covering the CIB,\nCCB, CB, AWM and certain corporate functions including\nTreasury and CIO.\nPrice verification process The VCG verifies fair value\nestimates provided by the risk-taking functions by\nleveraging independently derived prices, valuation\ninputs and other market data, where available. Where\nindependent prices or inputs are not available, the\nVCG performs additional review to ensure the\nreasonableness of the estimates. The additional review\nmay include evaluating the limited market activity\nincluding client unwinds, benchmarking valuation\ninputs to those used for similar instruments,\ndecomposing the valuation of structured instruments\ninto individual components, comparing expected to\nactual cash flows, reviewing profit and loss trends,\nand reviewing trends in collateral valuation. There\nare also additional levels of management review for\nmore significant or complex positions. The VCG\ndetermines any valuation adjustments that may be\nrequired to the estimates provided by the risk-taking\nfunctions. No adjustments to quoted prices are applied\nfor instruments classified within level 1 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy (refer to the discussion below for\nfurther information on the fair value hierarchy). For\nother positions, judgment is required to assess the\nneed for valuation adjustments to appropriately\nreflect liquidity considerations, unobservable\nparameters, and, for certain portfolios that meet\nspecified criteria, the size of the net open risk\nposition. The determination of such adjustments\nfollows a consistent framework across the Firm:\nLiquidity valuation adjustments are considered where\nan observable external price or valuation parameter\nexists but is of lower reliability, potentially due to\nlower market activity. Liquidity valuation adjustments\nare made based on current market conditions. Factors\nthat may be considered in determining the liquidity\nadjustment include analysis of: (1) the estimated bid-\noffer spread for the instrument being traded; (2)\nalternative pricing points for similar instruments in\nactive markets; and (3) the range of reasonable values\nthat the price or parameter could take. • The Firm\nmanages certain portfolios of financial instruments on\nthe basis of net open risk exposure and, as permitted\nby U.S. GAAP, has elected to estimate the fair value\nof such portfolios on the basis of a transfer of the\nentire net open risk position in an orderly\ntransaction. Where this is the case, valuation\nadjustments may be necessary to reflect the cost of\nexiting a larger-than-normal market-size net open risk\nposition. Where applied, such adjustments are based on\nfactors that a relevant market participant would\nconsider in the transfer of the net open risk\nposition, including the size of the adverse market\nmove that is likely to occur during the period\nrequired to reduce the net open risk position to a\nnormal market-size. • Uncertainty adjustments related\nto unobservable parameters may be made when positions\nare valued using prices or input parameters to\nvaluation models\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    171\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nthat are unobservable due to a lack of market activity\nor because they cannot be implied from observable\nmarket data. Such prices or parameters must be\nestimated and are, therefore, subject to management\njudgment. Adjustments are made to reflect the\nuncertainty inherent in the resulting valuation\nestimate. • Where appropriate, the Firm also applies\nadjustments to its estimates of fair value in order to\nappropriately reflect counterparty credit quality\n(CVA), the Firm’s own creditworthiness (DVA) and the\nimpact of funding (FVA), using a consistent framework\nacross the Firm. Refer to Credit and funding\nadjustments on page 188 of this Note for more\ninformation on such adjustments. Valuation model\nreview and approval If prices or quotes are not\navailable for an instrument or a similar instrument,\nfair value is generally determined using valuation\nmodels that consider relevant transaction terms such\nas maturity and use as inputs market-based or\nindependently sourced parameters. Where this is the\ncase the price verification process described above is\napplied to the inputs in those models. Under the\nFirm’s Estimations and Model Risk Management Policy,\nthe MRGR reviews and approves new models, as well as\nmaterial changes to existing models, prior to\nimplementation in the operating environment. In\ncertain circumstances exceptions may be granted to the\nFirm’s policy to allow a model to be used prior to\nreview or approval. The MRGR may also require the user\nto take appropriate actions to mitigate the model risk\nif it is to be used in the interim. These actions will\ndepend on the model and may include, for example,\nlimitation of trading activity. Valuation hierarchy A\nthree-level valuation hierarchy has been established\nunder U.S. GAAP for disclosure of fair value\nmeasurements. The valuation hierarchy is based on the\nobservability of inputs to the valuation of an asset\nor liability as of the measurement date. The three\nlevels are defined as follows. • Level 1 – inputs to\nthe valuation methodology are quoted prices\n(unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets. • Level 2 – inputs to the valuation\nmethodology include quoted prices for similar assets\nand liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are\nobservable for the asset or liability, either directly\nor indirectly, for substantially the full term of the\nfinancial instrument. • Level 3 – one or more inputs\nto the valuation methodology are unobservable and\nsignificant to the fair value measurement. A financial\ninstrument’s categorization within the valuation\nhierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\n172    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table describes the valuation methodologies generally used by the Firm to measure its significant\nproducts/instruments at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nProduct/instrument                    Valuation methodology                 Classifications in the valuation\nhierarchy\nSecurities financing agreements       Valuations are based on discounted    Predominantly level 2\ncash flows, which consider:\nDerivative features: refer to\nthe\ndiscussion of derivatives below\nfor\nfurther information.\nMarket rates for the respective\nmaturity\nCollateral characteristics\nLoans and lending-related\ncommitments —\nwholesale\nLoans carried at fair value           Where observable market data is\n(trading loans and non-trading        available, valuations are based       Level 2 or 3\nloans) and associated                 on:\nlending-related commitments\nObserved market prices\n(circumstances\nare infrequent)\nRelevant broker quotes\nObserved market prices for\nsimilar\ninstruments\nWhere observable market data is\nunavailable or limited, valuations\nare based on discounted cash\nflows, which consider the\nfollowing:\nCredit spreads derived from the\ncost of CDS;

104.5billion,\nrespectively, which were mortgage-related.\n(b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions\nfrom trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current\npresentation.\n(c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net\nrealizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction\ncosts”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial\nto the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical\ncommodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the\ncarrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost\nbasis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    177\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\ndiscussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information,\nall physical commodities inventories have been included in each period presented.\n(d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold\nbut not yet purchased (short positions).\n(e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as\na practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nthe fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real estate and\nother funds, were $ 670million and $ 684million, respectively. Included in these balances at December 31, 2020 and\n2019, were trading assets of $ 52million and $ 54million, respectively, and other assets of $ 618million and $\n630million, respectively.\n(f) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, included within loans were $ 15.1billion and $ 19.8billion, respectively, of\nresidential first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.3billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien\nmortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S.\nGSEs and government agencies of $ 8.4billion and $ 13.6billion, respectively.\n(g) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and\nthe related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level\n3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n178    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nLevel 3 valuations\nThe Firm has established well-structured processes for determining fair value, including for instruments where fair\nvalue is estimated using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). Refer to pages 171-175 of this Note for further\ninformation on the Firm’s valuation process and a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments. Estimating fair value requires the application of judgment. The type and level of\njudgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available to the Firm. For\ninstruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant\nunobservable inputs and are therefore classified within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments used to\nestimate fair value are more significant than those required when estimating the fair value of instruments\nclassified within levels 1 and 2. In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an instrument within level 3,\nmanagement must first determine the appropriate valuation model or other valuation technique to use. Second, due to\nthe lack of observability of significant inputs, management must assess relevant empirical data in deriving\nvaluation inputs including transaction details, yield curves, interest rates, prepayment speed, default rates,\nvolatilities, correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or debt prices), valuations of comparable\ninstruments, foreign exchange rates and credit curves. The following table presents the Firm’s primary level 3\nfinancial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of those financial instruments, the\nsignificant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the weighted or arithmetic averages of\nsuch inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is based on the significance of the\nunobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial instruments typically include\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources) in\naddition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are not included in the table. In\naddition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial instruments using securities\nand derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy. The range of values\npresented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used to value the significant groups\nof instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the weighted averages of the input\nvalues presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the instruments that the input is being\nused to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic average values do not reflect the\ndegree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s estimates and assumptions. Rather,\nthey reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and the relative distribution of\ninstruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may have similar levels of\nmarket risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied volatility levels\nbecause the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input range and weighted\naverage values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the characteristics of\nthe instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    179\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLevel 3\ninputs(a)\nDecember\n31, 2020\nFair    Principal     Unobservab…      Range of\nProduct/I…

The impact of changes in inputs may not be independent, as a\nchange in one unobservable input may give rise to a change in another unobservable input. Where relationships do\nexist between two unobservable inputs, those relationships are discussed below. Relationships may also exist\nbetween observable and unobservable inputs (for example, as observable interest rates rise, unobservable prepayment\nrates decline); such relationships have not been included in the discussion below. In addition, for each of the\nindividual relationships described below, the inverse relationship would also generally apply. The following\ndiscussion also provides a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that\naffect the range of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Yield – The yield of an asset is the\ninterest rate used to discount future cash flows in a discounted cash flow calculation. An increase in the yield,\nin isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Credit spread – The credit spread is the\namount of additional annualized return over the market interest rate that a market participant would demand for\ntaking exposure to the credit risk of an instrument. The credit spread for an instrument forms part of the discount\nrate used in a discounted cash flow calculation. Generally, an increase in the credit spread would result in a\ndecrease in a fair value measurement. The yield and the credit spread of a particular mortgage-backed security\nprimarily reflect the risk inherent in the instrument. The yield is also impacted by the absolute level of the\ncoupon paid by the instrument (which may not correspond directly to the level of inherent risk). Therefore, the\nrange of yield and credit spreads reflects the range of risk inherent in various instruments owned by the Firm. The\nrisk inherent in mortgage-backed securities is driven by the subordination of the security being valued and the\ncharacteristics of the underlying mortgages within the collateralized pool, including borrower FICO scores, LTV\nratios for residential mortgages and the nature of the property and/or any tenants for commercial mortgages. For\ncorporate debt securities, obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and other similar instruments, credit\nspreads reflect the credit quality of the obligor and the tenor of the obligation. Prepayment speed – The\nprepayment speed is a measure of the voluntary unscheduled principal repayments of a prepayable obligation in a\ncollateralized pool. Prepayment speeds generally decline as borrower delinquencies rise. An increase in prepayment\nspeeds, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a premium to par\nand an increase in a fair value measurement of assets valued at a discount to par. Prepayment speeds may vary from\ncollateral pool to collateral pool, and are driven by the type and location of the underlying borrower, and the\nremaining tenor of the obligation as well as the level and type (e.g., fixed or floating) of interest rate being\npaid by the borrower. Typically collateral pools with higher borrower credit quality have a higher prepayment rate\nthan those with lower borrower credit quality, all other factors being equal. Conditional default rate – The\nconditional default rate is a measure of the reduction in the outstanding collateral balance underlying a\ncollateralized obligation as a result of defaults. While there is typically no direct relationship between\nconditional default rates and prepayment speeds, collateralized obligations for which the underlying collateral has\nhigh prepayment speeds will tend to have lower conditional default rates. An increase in conditional default rates\nwould generally be accompanied by an increase in loss severity and an increase in credit spreads. An increase in\nthe conditional default rate, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. Conditional\ndefault rates reflect the quality of the collateral underlying a securitization and the structure of the\nsecuritization itself. Based on the types of securities owned in the Firm’s market-making portfolios, conditional\ndefault rates are most typically at the lower end of the range presented. Loss severity – The loss severity (the\ninverse concept is the recovery rate) is the expected amount of future realized losses resulting from the ultimate\nliquidation of a particular loan, expressed as the net amount of loss relative to the outstanding loan balance. An\nincrease in loss severity is generally accompanied by an increase in conditional default rates. An increase in the\nloss severity, in isolation, would result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The loss severity applied in\nvaluing a mortgage-backed security investment depends on factors relating to the underlying mortgages, including\nthe LTV ratio, the nature of the lender’s lien on the property and other instrument-specific factors.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    181\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCorrelation – Correlation is a measure of the relationship between the movements of two variables. Correlation is a\npricing input for a derivative product where the payoff is driven by one or more underlying risks. Correlation\ninputs are related to the type of derivative (e.g., interest rate, credit, equity, foreign exchange and commodity)\ndue to the nature of the underlying risks. When parameters are positively correlated, an increase in one parameter\nwill result in an increase in the other parameter. When parameters are negatively correlated, an increase in one\nparameter will result in a decrease in the other parameter. An increase in correlation can result in an increase or\na decrease in a fair value measurement. Given a short correlation position, an increase in correlation, in\nisolation, would generally result in a decrease in a fair value measurement. The level of correlation used in the\nvaluation of derivatives with multiple underlying risks depends on a number of factors including the nature of\nthose risks. For example, the correlation between two credit risk exposures would be different than that between\ntwo interest rate risk exposures. Similarly, the tenor of the transaction may also impact the correlation input, as\nthe relationship between the underlying risks may be different over different time periods. Furthermore,\ncorrelation levels are very much dependent on market conditions and could have a relatively wide range of levels\nwithin or across asset classes over time, particularly in volatile market conditions. Volatility – Volatility is a\nmeasure of the variability in possible returns for an instrument, parameter or market index given how much the\nparticular instrument, parameter or index changes in value over time. Volatility is a pricing input for options,\nincluding equity options, commodity options, and interest rate options. Generally, the higher the volatility of the\nunderlying, the riskier the instrument. Given a long position in an option, an increase in volatility, in\nisolation, would generally result in an increase in a fair value measurement. The level of volatility used in the\nvaluation of a particular option-based derivative depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the risk\nunderlying the option (e.g., the volatility of a particular equity security may be significantly different from\nthat of a particular commodity index), the tenor of the derivative as well as the strike price of the option.\nForward price - Forward price is the price at which the buyer agrees to purchase the asset underlying a forward\ncontract on the predetermined future delivery date, and is such that the value of the contract is zero at\ninception. The forward price is used as an input in the valuation of certain derivatives and depends on a number of\nfactors including interest rates, the current price of the underlying asset, and the expected income to be received\nand costs to be incurred by the seller as a result of holding that asset until the delivery date. An increase in\nthe forward can result in an increase or a decrease in a fair value measurement. Changes in level 3 recurring fair\nvalue measurements The following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including\nchanges in fair value) for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy\nfor the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. When a determination is made to classify a financial\ninstrument within level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall\nfair value measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable\nor level 3 components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to\nexternal sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part\nto observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable\ncomponents of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within\nlevel 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included\nbelow, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management\nactivities related to such level 3 instruments.\n182    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nFa…                                                                                          Ch…\nva…

Gains and\nlosses The following describes significant components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. These amounts\nexclude any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities where the financial instruments are classified as\nlevel 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy.

These\nmarket parameters generally do not consider factors\nsuch as counterparty nonperformance risk, the Firm’s\nown credit quality, and funding costs. Therefore, it\nis generally necessary to make adjustments to the base\nestimate of fair value to reflect these factors. CVA\nrepresents the adjustment, relative to the relevant\nbenchmark interest rate, necessary to reflect\ncounterparty nonperformance risk. The Firm estimates\nCVA using a scenario analysis to estimate the expected\npositive credit exposure across all of the Firm’s\nexisting positions with each counterparty, and then\nestimates losses based on the probability of default\nand estimated recovery rate as a result of a\ncounterparty credit event considering contractual\nfactors designed to mitigate the Firm’s credit\nexposure, such as collateral and legal rights of\noffset. The key inputs to this methodology are (i) the\nprobability of a default event occurring for each\ncounterparty, as derived from observed or estimated\nCDS spreads; and (ii) estimated recovery rates implied\nby CDS spreads, adjusted to consider the differences\nin recovery rates as a derivative creditor relative to\nthose reflected in CDS spreads, which generally\nreflect senior unsecured creditor risk. FVA represents\nthe adjustment to reflect the impact of funding and is\nrecognized where there is evidence that a market\nparticipant in the principal market would incorporate\nit in a transfer of the instrument. The Firm’s FVA\nframework, applied to uncollateralized (including\npartially collateralized) over-the-counter (“OTC”)\nderivatives incorporates key inputs such as: (i) the\nexpected funding requirements arising from the Firm’s\npositions with\neach counterparty and collateral arrangements; and\n(ii) the estimated market funding cost in the\nprincipal market which, for derivative liabilities,\nconsiders the Firm’s credit risk (DVA). For\ncollateralized derivatives, the fair value is\nestimated by discounting expected future cash flows at\nthe relevant overnight indexed swap rate given the\nunderlying collateral agreement with the counterparty,\nand therefore a separate FVA is not necessary.\nThe following table provides the impact of credit and\nfunding adjustments on principal transactions revenue\nin the respective periods, excluding the effect of any\nassociated hedging activities. The FVA presented below\nincludes the impact of the Firm’s own credit quality\non the inception value of liabilities as well as the\nimpact of changes in the Firm’s own credit quality\nover time.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                         2020       2019       2018\nCredit and funding adjustments:\nDerivatives CVA                    $  -337    $   241    $   193\nDerivatives FVA                        -64        199        -74\nValuation adjustments on fair value option elected\nliabilities\nThe valuation of the Firm’s liabilities for which the\nfair value option has been elected requires\nconsideration of the Firm’s own credit risk. DVA on\nfair value option elected liabilities reflects changes\n(subsequent to the issuance of the liability) in the\nFirm’s probability of default and LGD, which are\nestimated based on changes in the Firm’s credit spread\nobserved in the bond market.

Financial instruments for which carrying value approximates fair value Certain financial\ninstruments that are not carried at fair value on the Consolidated balance sheets are carried at amounts that\napproximate fair value, due to their short-term nature and generally negligible credit risk. These instruments\ninclude cash and due from banks, deposits with banks, federal funds sold, securities purchased under resale\nagreements and securities borrowed, short-term receivables and accrued interest receivable, short-term borrowings,\nfederal funds purchased, securities loaned and sold under repurchase agreements, accounts payable, and accrued\nliabilities. In addition, U.S. GAAP requires that the fair value of deposit liabilities with no stated maturity\n(i.e., demand, savings and certain money market deposits) be equal to their carrying value; recognition of the\ninherent funding value of these instruments is not permitted.\n190    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nThe following table presents by fair value hierarchy classification the carrying values and estimated fair values\nat December 31, 2020 and 2019, of financial assets and liabilities, excluding financial instruments that are\ncarried at fair value on a recurring basis, and their classification within the fair value hierarchy.\nDec…                                                   Dec…\n31,                                                    31,\n2020                                                   2019\nEst…                                                   Es…\nfair                                                   fa…\nval…                                                   va…\nhie…                                                   hi…\nTot…                                                 Tot…\n(in       Car…       Lev…       Lev…       Lev…       est…       Car…       Le…       Lev…       Le…       est…\nbi…       val…          1          2          3       fair       val…         1          2         3       fair\nval…                                                 val…\nFi…\nas…\nCa…\nand\ndue    $  24.9    $  24.9    $     —    $     —    $  24.9    $  21.7    $  21…    $     —    $    —    $  21.7\nfr…\nba…\nDe…\nwi…       502…       502…          —          —       502…       241…       24…          —         —       241…\nba…\nAc…\nin…\nand       89.4          —       89.3        0.1       89.4       71.3         —       71.2       0.1       71.3\nac…\nre…\nFe…\nfu…\nso…\nand\nse…       58.3          —       58.3          —       58.3       234…         —       234…         —       234…\npu…\nun…\nre…\nag…\nSe…       107…          —       107…          —       107…       133…         —       133…         —       133…\nbo…\nIn…\nse…       201…       53.2       152…          —       205…       47.5       0.1       48.8         —       48.9\nhe…\nLo…\nnet\nof\nal…       940…          —       210…       755…       966…       939…         —       214…       73…       949…\nfor\nlo…\nlo…\nOt…       81.8          —       80.0        1.9       81.9       61.3         —       60.6       0.8       61.4\nFi…\nli…\nDe…    $  2,1…    $     —    $  2,1…    $     —    $  2,1…    $  1,5…    $    —    $  1,5…    $    —    $  1,5…\nFe…\nfu…\npu…\nand\nse…\nlo…       59.5          —       59.5          —       59.5       183…         —       183…         —       183…\nor\nso…\nun…\nre…\nag…\nSh…       28.3          —       28.3          —       28.3       35.0         —       35.0         —       35.0\nbo…\nAc…\npa…\nand       186…          —       181…        4.3       186…       164…       0.1       160…       3.5       163…\not…\nli…\nBe…\nin…\nis…       17.5          —       17.6          —       17.6       17.8         —       17.9         —       17.9\nby\nco…\nVI…\nLo…       204…          —       209…        3.2       212…       215…         —       218…       3.5       221…\nde…\n(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of\nthe underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,\nincluding expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary\nmarket spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.\nCarrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s\nexpected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and\ncarrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,\nmarket liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying\nvalue.\nThe majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related\ncommitments were as follows for the periods indicated.\nDec…                                                   Dec…\n31,                                                    31,\n2020                                                   2019\nEst…                                                   Es…\nfair                                                   fa…\nval…                                                   va…\nhie…                                                   hi…\nTot…                                                 Tot…\n(in       Car…       Lev…       Lev…       Lev…       est…       Car…       Le…       Lev…       Le…       est…\nbi…       val…       1          2             3       fair       val…       1         2            3       fair\nval…                                                 val…\nWh…\nle…    $   2.2    $  —       $  —       $   2.1    $   2.1    $   1.2    $  —      $  —       $  1.9    $   1.9\nco…\n(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is\nrecognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.\n(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.\nThe Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.

The Firm has elected to\nmeasure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income statement volatility\ncaused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain instruments that\notherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management arrangements that are\naccounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are managed on a fair\nvalue basis. The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments: • Loans purchased or originated\nas part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting, or managed on a fair value\nbasis, including lending-related commitments • Certain securities financing agreements • Owned beneficial interests\nin securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would otherwise be required to be\nseparately accounted for as a derivative instrument • Structured notes, which are predominantly financial\ninstruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are issued as part of client-driven activities • Certain long-\nterm beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying assets are\ncarried at fair value\n192    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nChanges in fair value under the fair value option election\nThe following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, for items for which the fair value option was elected.

Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding\ninterest income and interest expense.\nDetermination of instrument-specific credit risk for items for which the fair value option was elected The\nfollowing describes how the gains and losses that are attributable to changes in instrument-specific credit risk,\nwere determined. • Loans and lending-related commitments: For floating-rate instruments, all changes in value are\nattributed to instrument-specific credit risk. For fixed-rate instruments, an allocation of the changes in value\nfor the period is made between those changes in value that are interest rate-related and changes in value that are\ncredit-related. Allocations are generally based on an analysis of borrower-specific credit spread and recovery\ninformation, where available, or benchmarking to similar entities or industries. • Long-term debt: Changes in value\nattributable to instrument-specific credit risk were derived principally from observable changes in the Firm’s\ncredit spread as observed in the bond market. • Securities financing agreements: Generally, for these types of\nagreements, there is a requirement that collateral be maintained with a market value equal to or in excess of the\nprincipal amount loaned; as a result, there would be no adjustment or an immaterial adjustment for instrument-\nspecific credit risk related to these agreements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    193\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nDifference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding\nThe following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining\ncontractual principal balance outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, for loans, long-term debt and long-term\nbeneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.\nDece…\n31,                                               Fair                                                 Fair\n(in                                              value                                                value\nmill…         2020                              over/…             2019                              over/…\nLoans       Contr…                              contr…           Contr…                              contr…\nNona…       princ…                   Fair       princ…           princ…                   Fair       princ…\nloans       outst…                  value       outst…           outst…                  value       outst…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas       $   3,386              $     555    $  -2,831        $   2,563              $     234    $  -2,329\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoan…        1,867                  1,507         -360              964                    696         -268\nSubt…        5,253                  2,062       -3,191            3,527                    930       -2,597\n90 or\nmore\ndays\npast\ndue\nand\ngove…\nguar…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas               —                      —            —                —                      —            —\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoans          328                    317          -11              138                    129           -9\nSubt…          328                    317          -11              138                    129           -9\nAll\nother\nperf…\nloan…\nLoans\nrepo…\nas           7,917                  6,439       -1,478            8,288                  6,779       -1,509\ntrad…\nasse…\nLoan…       42,022                 42,650          628           43,955                 44,130          175\nSubt…       49,939                 49,089         -850           52,243                 50,909       -1,334\nTotal    $  55,520              $  51,468    $  -4,052        $  55,908              $  51,968    $  -3,940\nloans\nLong…\ndebt\nPrin…    $  40,560        -e    $  40,526    $     -34        $  40,124        -e    $  39,246    $    -878\ndebt\nNonp…               NA             36,291               NA               NA             36,499               NA\ndebt…\nTotal\nlong…               NA          $  76,817               NA               NA          $  75,745               NA\ndebt\nLong…\nbene…\ninte…\nNonp…               NA          $      41               NA               NA          $      36               NA\ndebt…\nTotal\nlong…               NA          $      41               NA               NA          $      36               NA\nbene…\ninte…\n(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions\nfrom trading assets to loans and other assets.

Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the\nFirm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and\nlong-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for\nstructured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature\nembedded in the note.

JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit\nrisk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s\nagreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels\nare adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are\nmanaged primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the\nportfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting\npolicies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the\nFirm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by\nindustry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty\nbasis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales,\nsecuritizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.\nRefer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular\nloan product or industry segment (e.g., real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high\nLTV ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage\nare included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses.\n196    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nThe table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the\nFirm’s three credit portfolio segments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 for\nfurther information.\n(e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 92% and 8%,\nrespectively, at December 31, 2020 and 90% and 10%, respectively, at December 31, 2019 . Refer to Note 14 for more\ninformation on exposures to SPEs.\n(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and\nreadily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is\ngenerally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and\nmonitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and\naccounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\n(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $ 516.9billion and $ 254.0billion, at December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.\n(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit\nportfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash\ncollateral held against derivative receivables.\n(i) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions\nfrom trading assets to loans, which resulted in a corresponding reclassification of certain off-balance sheet\ncommitments. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n(j) At December 31, 2020, included $ 19.2billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. PPP loans are\nguaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-\noffs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans.\n(k) Represents lending-related financial instruments.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    197\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 5 – Derivative instruments\nDerivative contracts derive their value from underlying asset prices, indices, reference rates, other inputs or a\ncombination of these factors and may expose counterparties to risks and rewards of an underlying asset or liability\nwithout having to initially invest in, own or exchange the asset or liability. JPMorgan Chase makes markets in\nderivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk exposures. Predominantly all of\nthe Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making or risk management purposes. Market-making derivatives\nThe majority of the Firm’s derivatives are entered into for market-making purposes. Clients use derivatives to\nmitigate or modify interest rate, credit, foreign exchange, equity and commodity risks. The Firm actively manages\nthe risks from its exposure to these derivatives by entering into other derivative contracts or by purchasing or\nselling other financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from client derivatives. Risk\nmanagement derivatives The Firm manages certain market and credit risk exposures using derivative instruments,\nincluding derivatives in hedge accounting relationships and other derivatives that are used to manage risks\nassociated with specified assets and liabilities. The Firm generally uses interest rate derivatives to manage the\nrisk associated with changes in interest rates. Fixed-rate assets and liabilities appreciate or depreciate in\nmarket value as interest rates change. Similarly, interest income and expense increase or decrease as a result of\nvariable-rate assets and liabilities resetting to current market rates, and as a result of the repayment and\nsubsequent origination or issuance of fixed-rate assets and liabilities at current market rates. Gains and losses\non the derivative instruments related to these assets and liabilities are expected to substantially offset this\nvariability. Foreign currency derivatives are used to manage the foreign exchange risk associated with certain\nforeign currency–denominated (i.e., non-U.S. dollar) assets and liabilities and forecasted transactions, as well as\nthe Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are not the\nU.S. dollar. As a result of fluctuations in foreign currencies, the U.S. dollar–equivalent values of the foreign\ncurrency–denominated assets and liabilities or the forecasted revenues or expenses increase or decrease. Gains or\nlosses on the derivative instruments related to these foreign currency–denominated assets or liabilities, or\nforecasted transactions, are expected to substantially offset this variability. Commodities derivatives are used to\nmanage the price risk of certain commodities inventories. Gains or losses on these derivative instruments are\nexpected to substantially offset the depreciation or appreciation of the related inventory. Credit derivatives are\nused to manage the counterparty credit risk associated with loans and lending-related commitments. Credit\nderivatives compensate the purchaser when the entity referenced in the contract experiences a credit event, such as\nbankruptcy or a failure to pay an obligation when due. Credit derivatives primarily consist of CDS. Refer to the\nCredit derivatives section on pages 209-211 of this Note for a further discussion of credit derivatives. Refer to\nthe risk management derivatives gains and losses table on page 209 of this Note, and the hedge accounting gains and\nlosses tables on pages 206-208 of this Note for more information about risk management derivatives. Derivative\ncounterparties and settlement types The Firm enters into OTC derivatives, which are negotiated and settled\nbilaterally with the derivative counterparty. The Firm also enters into, as principal, certain ETD such as futures\nand options, and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with CCPs. ETD contracts are generally standardized contracts\ntraded on an exchange and cleared by the CCP, which is the Firm’s counterparty from the inception of the\ntransactions. OTC-cleared derivatives are traded on a bilateral basis and then novated to the CCP for clearing.\nDerivative clearing services The Firm provides clearing services for clients in which the Firm acts as a clearing\nmember at certain exchanges and clearing houses. The Firm does not reflect the clients’ derivative contracts in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 28 for further information on the Firm’s clearing services.\nAccounting for derivatives All free-standing derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account are required to\nbe recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm nets\nderivative assets and liabilities, and the related cash collateral receivables and payables, when a legally\nenforceable master netting agreement exists between the Firm and the derivative counterparty. Refer to Note 1 for\nfurther discussion of the offsetting of assets and liabilities. The accounting for changes in value of a derivative\ndepends on whether or not the transaction has been designated and qualifies for hedge accounting. Derivatives that\nare not designated as hedges are reported and measured at fair value through earnings. The tabular disclosures on\npages 202-209 of this Note provide additional information on the amount of, and reporting for, derivative assets,\nliabilities, gains and losses. Refer to Notes 2 and 3 for a further discussion of derivatives embedded in\nstructured notes.\n198    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nDerivatives designated as hedges The Firm applies hedge accounting to certain derivatives executed for risk\nmanagement purposes – generally interest rate, foreign exchange and commodity derivatives. However, JPMorgan Chase\ndoes not seek to apply hedge accounting to all of the derivatives involved in the Firm’s risk management\nactivities. For example, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to purchased CDS used to manage the credit risk\nof loans and lending-related commitments, because of the difficulties in qualifying such contracts as hedges. For\nthe same reason, the Firm does not apply hedge accounting to certain interest rate, foreign exchange, and commodity\nderivatives used for risk management purposes. To qualify for hedge accounting, a derivative must be highly\neffective at reducing the risk associated with the exposure being hedged. In addition, for a derivative to be\ndesignated as a hedge, the risk management objective and strategy must be documented. Hedge documentation must\nidentify the derivative hedging instrument, the asset or liability or forecasted transaction and type of risk to be\nhedged, and how the effectiveness of the derivative is assessed prospectively and retrospectively. To assess\neffectiveness, the Firm uses statistical methods such as regression analysis, nonstatistical methods such as\ndollar-value comparisons of the change in the fair value of the derivative to the change in the fair value or cash\nflows of the hedged item, and qualitative comparisons of critical terms and the evaluation of any changes in those\nterms. The extent to which a derivative has been, and is expected to continue to be, highly effective at offsetting\nchanges in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item must be assessed and documented at least quarterly. If\nit is determined that a derivative is not highly effective at hedging the designated exposure, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued. There are three types of hedge accounting designations: fair value hedges, cash flow hedges and net\ninvestment hedges. JPMorgan Chase uses fair value hedges primarily to hedge fixed-rate long-term debt, AFS\nsecurities and certain commodities inventories. For qualifying fair value hedges, the changes in the fair value of\nthe derivative, and in the value of the hedged item for the risk being hedged, are recognized in earnings. Certain\namounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings over the life\nof the derivative. If the hedge relationship is terminated, then the adjustment to the hedged item continues to be\nreported as part of the basis of the hedged item, and for benchmark interest rate hedges, is amortized to earnings\nas a yield adjustment. Derivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of\nthe hedged item – primarily net interest income and principal transactions revenue. JPMorgan Chase uses cash flow\nhedges primarily to hedge the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows from floating-rate assets and\nliabilities and foreign currency–denominated revenue and expense. For qualifying cash flow hedges, changes in the\nfair value of the derivative are recorded in OCI and recognized in earnings as the hedged item affects earnings.\nDerivative amounts affecting earnings are recognized consistent with the classification of the hedged item –\nprimarily noninterest revenue, net interest income and compensation expense. If the hedge relationship is\nterminated, then the change in value of the derivative recorded in AOCI is recognized in earnings when the cash\nflows that were hedged affect earnings. For hedge relationships that are discontinued because a forecasted\ntransaction is expected to not occur according to the original hedge forecast, any related derivative values\nrecorded in AOCI are immediately recognized in earnings. JPMorgan Chase uses net investment hedges to protect the\nvalue of the Firm’s net investments in certain non-U.S. subsidiaries or branches whose functional currencies are\nnot the U.S. dollar. For qualifying net investment hedges, changes in the fair value of the derivatives due to\nchanges in spot foreign exchange rates are recorded in OCI as translation adjustments. Amounts excluded from the\nassessment of effectiveness are recorded directly in earnings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    199\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table

In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm refined its approach for disclosing additional\ncollateral held by the Firm that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the\nFirm’s favor.

It is the policy of JPMorgan Chase to actively pursue, where possible, the use of legally\nenforceable master netting arrangements and collateral agreements to mitigate derivative counterparty credit risk\ninherent in derivative receivables.\nWhile derivative receivables expose the Firm to credit risk, derivative payables expose the Firm to liquidity risk,\nas the derivative contracts typically require the Firm to post cash or securities collateral with counterparties as\nthe fair value of the contracts moves in the counterparties’ favor or upon specified downgrades in the Firm’s and\nits subsidiaries’ respective credit ratings. Certain derivative contracts also provide for termination of the\ncontract, generally upon a downgrade of either the Firm or the counterparty, at the fair value of the derivative\ncontracts. The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-\ncleared derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings\ndowngrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at December 31, 2020\nand 2019.\nOTC and OTC-cleared derivative payables containing downgrade triggers\nDecember 31, (in millions)                                                          2020               2019\nAggregate fair value of net derivative                                   $  27,712          $  14,819\npayables\nCollateral posted                                                           26,289             13,329\nThe following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrelated to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features that may be\ntriggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be posted or\nterminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A downgrade by a single rating\nagency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another major\nrating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which additional\ninitial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments requirements.

This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact\nof the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged\nitems.\n(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in\nspot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in\nforeign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal\ntransactions revenue and net interest income.\n(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the\nlower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were\nrecorded in principal transactions revenue.\n(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the\nderivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-\ncurrency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount\nover the life of the derivative or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.\n(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization\napproach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads.

As a result of the application of hedge\naccounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and losses in current\nperiods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to net income in future\nperiods.\n(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments\nrelated to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods.

For cash flow hedges that have been\nterminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized in\nearnings is approximately nine years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash flows.\nFor open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is\napproximately seven years.

Gains and losses were recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue.\n(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate\nforeign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-\ndenominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses\nwere recorded in principal transactions revenue.\nGains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in\nderivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with\nnet open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from\nderivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management\ncategories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in\nprincipal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.\nCredit derivatives Credit derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from the credit risk\nassociated with the debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity) and which allow one party (the protection\npurchaser) to transfer that risk to another party (the protection seller). Credit derivatives expose the protection\npurchaser to the creditworthiness of the protection seller, as the protection seller is required to make payments\nunder the contract when the reference entity experiences a credit event, such as a bankruptcy, a failure to pay its\nobligation or a restructuring. The seller of credit protection receives a premium for providing protection but has\nthe risk that the underlying instrument referenced in the contract will be subject to a credit event. The Firm is\nboth a purchaser and seller of protection in the credit derivatives market and uses these derivatives for two\nprimary purposes. First, in its capacity as a market-maker, the Firm actively manages a portfolio of credit\nderivatives by purchasing and selling credit protection, predominantly on corporate debt obligations, to meet the\nneeds of customers. Second, as an end-user, the Firm uses credit derivatives to manage credit risk associated with\nlending exposures (loans and unfunded commitments) and derivatives counterparty exposures in the Firm’s wholesale\nbusinesses, and to manage the credit risk arising from certain financial instruments in the Firm’s market-making\nbusinesses. Following is a summary of various types of credit derivatives.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    209\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nCredit default swaps Credit derivatives may reference the credit of either a single reference entity (“single-\nname”) or a broad-based index. The Firm purchases and sells protection on both single- name and index-reference\nobligations. Single-name CDS and index CDS contracts are either OTC or OTC-cleared derivative contracts. Single-\nname CDS are used to manage the default risk of a single reference entity, while index CDS contracts are used to\nmanage the credit risk associated with the broader credit markets or credit market segments. Like the S&P 500 and\nother market indices, a CDS index consists of a portfolio of CDS across many reference entities. New series of CDS\nindices are periodically established with a new underlying portfolio of reference entities to reflect changes in\nthe credit markets. If one of the reference entities in the index experiences a credit event, then the reference\nentity that defaulted is removed from the index. CDS can also be referenced against specific portfolios of\nreference names or against customized exposure levels based on specific client demands: for example, to provide\nprotection against the first $ 1million of realized credit losses in a $ 10million portfolio of exposure. Such\nstructures are commonly known as tranche CDS. For both single-name CDS contracts and index CDS contracts, upon the\noccurrence of a credit event, under the terms of a CDS contract neither party to the CDS contract has recourse to\nthe reference entity. The protection purchaser has recourse to the protection seller for the difference between the\nface value of the CDS contract and the fair value of the reference obligation at settlement of the credit\nderivative contract, also known as the recovery value. The protection purchaser does not need to hold the debt\ninstrument of the underlying reference entity in order to receive amounts due under the CDS contract when a credit\nevent occurs. Credit-related notes A credit-related note is a funded credit derivative where the issuer of the\ncredit-related note purchases from the note investor credit protection on a reference entity or an index. Under the\ncontract, the investor pays the issuer the par value of the note at the inception of the transaction, and in\nreturn, the issuer pays periodic payments to the investor, based on the credit risk of the referenced entity. The\nissuer also repays the investor the par value of the note at maturity unless the reference entity (or one of the\nentities that makes up a reference index) experiences a specified credit event. If a credit event occurs, the\nissuer is not obligated to repay the par value of the note, but rather, the issuer pays the investor the difference\nbetween the par value of the note and the fair value of the defaulted reference obligation at the time of\nsettlement. Neither party to the credit-related note has recourse to the defaulting reference entity. The following\ntables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm sold and\npurchased as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Upon a credit event, the Firm as a seller of protection would typically\npay out only a percentage of the full notional amount of net protection sold, as the amount actually required to be\npaid on the contracts takes into account the recovery value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement.\nThe Firm manages the credit risk on contracts to sell protection by purchasing protection with identical or similar\nunderlying reference entities. Other purchased protection referenced in the following tables includes credit\nderivatives bought on related, but not identical, reference positions (including indices, portfolio coverage and\nother reference points) as well as protection purchased through credit-related notes.\n210    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nThe Firm does not use notional amounts of credit derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such\nderivatives, because the notional amount does not take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit\nevent, the recovery value of the reference obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of\nwhich reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks associated with such derivatives.\nTotal\ncredit\nderivatives\nand\ncredit-rel…\nnotes\nDecember               Maximum          Protection\n31, 2020(in       payout/Noti…          purchased                                        Net\nmillions)               amount          with                                      protection              Other\nCredit              Protection          identical                              (sold)/purch…         protection\nderivatives               sold          underlyings…                                      c)       purchased(d)\nCredit\ndefault        $      -535,094                          $  554,565          $         19,471    $         4,001\nswaps\nOther\ncredit                 -40,084                              57,344                    17,260              9,415\nderivative…\nTotal\ncredit                -575,178                             611,909                    36,731             13,416\nderivatives\nCredit-rel…                  —                                   —                         —             10,248\nnotes\nTotal          $      -575,178                          $  611,909          $         36,731    $        23,664\nMaximum\npayout/Noti…\namount\nProtection\nProtection          purchased                                        Net              Other\nsold          with                                      protection         protection\nidentical                              (sold)/purch…       purchased(d)\nunderlyings…\nDecember\n31, 2019\n(in\nmillions)\nCredit\nderivatives\nCredit\ndefault        $      -562,338                          $  571,892          $          9,554    $         3,936\nswaps\nOther\ncredit                 -50,395    -e                        46,541    -e              -3,854              7,364\nderivative…\nTotal\ncredit                -612,733                             618,433                     5,700             11,300\nderivatives\nCredit-rel…                  —                                   —                         —              9,606\nnotes\nTotal          $      -612,733                          $  618,433          $          5,700    $        20,906\n(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.\n(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is\nidentical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each\nindividual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection\nsold.\n(c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would\ngenerally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement\nvalue.\n(d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where\nthe Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.\n(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\nThe following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of\ncredit derivatives and credit-related notes as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of\nprotection.

The related contracts are\noften terminable on demand and the Firm has no\nremaining obligation to deliver future services. For\narrangements with a fixed term, the Firm may commit to\ndeliver services in the future. Revenue associated\nwith these remaining performance obligations typically\ndepends on the occurrence of future events or\nunderlying asset values, and is not recognized until\nthe outcome of those events or values are known.\nInvestment banking fees This revenue category includes\ndebt and equity underwriting and advisory fees. As an\nunderwriter, the Firm helps clients raise capital via\npublic offering and private placement of various types\nof debt and equity instruments. Underwriting fees are\nprimarily based on the issuance price and quantity of\nthe underlying instruments, and are recognized as\nrevenue typically upon execution of the client’s\ntransaction.

Amounts paid to these\nthird-party service providers are generally recorded\nin professional and outside services expense.\nThe following table presents the components of Firmwide asset management, administration and commissions.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                  2020         2019         2018\nAsset management fees\nInvestment management fees(a)             $  11,694    $  10,865    $  10,768\nAll other asset management fees(b)              338          315          270\nTotal asset management fees                  12,032       11,180       11,038\nTotal administration fees(c)                  2,249        2,197        2,179\nCommissions and other fees\nBrokerage commissions(d)                      2,959        2,439        2,505\nAll other commissions and fees(e)               937        1,092        1,071\nTotal commissions and fees                    3,896        3,531        3,576\nTotal asset management, administration    $  18,177    $  16,908    $  16,793\nand commissions\n(a) Represents fees earned from managing assets on behalf of the Firm’s clients, including investors in Firm-\nsponsored funds and owners of separately managed investment accounts.\n(b) Represents fees for services that are ancillary to investment management services, such as commissions earned\non the sales or distribution of mutual funds to clients. These fees are recorded as revenue at the time the service\nis rendered or, in the case of certain distribution fees based on the underlying fund’s asset value and/or investor\nredemption, recorded over time as the investor remains in the fund or upon investor redemption.\n(c) Predominantly includes fees for custody, securities lending, funds services and securities clearance. These\nfees are recorded as revenue over the period in which the related service is provided.\n(d) Represents commissions earned when the Firm acts as a broker, by facilitating its clients’ purchases and sales\nof securities and other financial instruments. Brokerage commissions are collected and recognized as revenue upon\noccurrence of the client transaction. The Firm reports certain costs paid to third-party clearing houses and\nexchanges net against commission revenue.\n(e) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and\ncommissions to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation.\nAsset management, administration and commissions are\nearned primarily by AWM, CIB and CCB. Refer to Note 32\nfor segment results. Mortgage fees and related income\nThis revenue category reflects CCB’s Home Lending net\nproduction and net mortgage servicing revenue. Net\nproduction revenue includes fees and income recognized\nas earned on mortgage loans originated with the intent\nto sell, and the impact of risk management activities\nassociated with the mortgage pipeline and warehouse\nloans. Net production revenue also includes gains and\nlosses on sales and lower of cost or fair value\nadjustments on mortgage loans held-for-sale (excluding\ncertain repurchased loans insured by U.S. government\nagencies), and changes in the fair value of financial\ninstruments measured under the fair value option. Net\nmortgage\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    213\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nservicing revenue includes operating revenue earned\nfrom servicing third-party mortgage loans, which is\nrecognized over the period in which the service is\nprovided; changes in the fair value of MSRs; the\nimpact of risk management activities associated with\nMSRs; and gains and losses on securitization of excess\nmortgage servicing. Net mortgage servicing revenue\nalso includes gains and losses on sales and lower of\ncost or fair value adjustments of certain repurchased\nloans insured by U.S. government agencies. Refer to\nNote 15 for further information on risk management\nactivities and MSRs. Net interest income from mortgage\nloans is recorded in interest income. Card income This\nrevenue category includes interchange and other income\nfrom credit and debit card transactions; and fees\nearned from processing card transactions for\nmerchants, both of which are recognized when purchases\nare made by a cardholder and presented net of certain\ntransaction-related costs. Card income also includes\naccount origination costs and annual fees, which are\ndeferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over\na 12-month period. Certain credit card products offer\nthe cardholder the ability to earn points based on\naccount activity, which the cardholder can choose to\nredeem for cash and non-cash rewards. The cost to the\nFirm related to these proprietary rewards programs\nvaries based on multiple factors including the terms\nand conditions of the rewards programs, cardholder\nactivity, cardholder reward redemption rates and\ncardholder reward selections. The Firm maintains a\nliability for its obligations under its rewards\nprograms and reports the current-period cost as a\nreduction of card income. Credit card revenue sharing\nagreements The Firm has contractual agreements with\nnumerous co-brand partners that grant the Firm\nexclusive rights to issue co-branded credit card\nproducts and market them to the customers of such\npartners. These partners endorse the co-brand credit\ncard programs and provide their customer or member\nlists to the Firm. The partners may also conduct\nmarketing activities and provide rewards redeemable\nunder their own loyalty programs that the Firm will\ngrant to co-brand credit cardholders based on account\nactivity. The terms of these agreements generally\nrange from fiveto ten years.\nThe Firm typically makes payments to the co-brand\ncredit card partners based on the cost of partners’\nmarketing activities and loyalty program rewards\nprovided to credit cardholders, new account\noriginations and sales volumes. Payments to partners\nbased on marketing efforts undertaken by the partners\nare expensed by the Firm as incurred and reported as\nmarketing expense. Payments for partner loyalty\nprogram rewards are reported as a reduction of card\nincome when incurred. Payments to partners based on\nnew credit card account originations are accounted for\nas direct loan origination costs and are deferred and\nrecognized as a reduction of card income on a\nstraight-line basis over a 12-month period. Payments\nto partners based on sales volumes are reported as a\nreduction of card income when the related interchange\nincome is earned.\nThe following table presents the components of card income:\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                 2020          2019                2018\nInterchange and merchant processing     $   18,563    $   20,370    $   18,808\nincome\nReward costs and partner payments(a)       -13,637       -14,540       -13,320          -c\nOther card income(b)                          -491          -754          -745\nTotal card income                       $    4,435    $    5,076    $    4,743\n(a) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from\nmarketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income.

The Firm also\nprovides a qualified defined contribution plan in the\nU.S. and maintains other similar arrangements in\ncertain non-U.S. locations. The principal defined\nbenefit pension plan in the U.S. is a qualified\nnoncontributory plan that provides benefits to\nsubstantially all U.S. employees who were hired prior\nto December 2, 2017. The Firm has frozen the U.S.\ndefined benefit pension plan (the “Plan Freeze”).\nEffective as of January 1, 2020 (and January 1, 2019\nfor new hires), new pay credits have been directed to\nthe U.S. defined contribution plan. Interest credits\nwill continue to accrue on the U.S. defined benefit\npension plan. As a result of the Plan Freeze, a\ncurtailment was triggered and a remeasurement of the\nU.S. defined benefit pension obligation and plan\nassets occurred as of November 30, 2018. The plan\ndesign change did not have a material impact on the\nU.S. defined benefit pension plan or the Firm’s\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The Firm also has\ndefined benefit pension plans that are offered in\ncertain non-U.S. locations based on factors such as\neligible compensation, age and/or years of service. It\nis the Firm’s policy to fund the pension plans in\namounts sufficient to meet the requirements under\napplicable laws. The Firm does not anticipate at this\ntime making any contribution to the U.S. defined\nbenefit pension plan in 2021. The 2021 contributions\nto the non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans are\nexpected to be $ 50million, of which $ 35million are\ncontractually required. The Firm also has a number of\nnonqualified noncontributory defined benefit pension\nplans that are unfunded. These plans provide\nsupplemental defined pension benefits to certain\nemployees.\nThe Firm offers postretirement medical and life\ninsurance benefits to certain U.S. retirees and\npostretirement medical benefits to certain qualifying\nU.S. and U.K. employees. The Firm partially defrays\nthe cost of its U.S. OPEB obligation through\ncorporate-owned life insurance (“COLI”) purchased on\nthe lives of eligible employees and retirees. While\nthe Firm owns the COLI policies, certain COLI proceeds\n(death benefits, withdrawals and other distributions)\nmay be used only to reimburse the Firm for its net\npostretirement benefit claim payments and related\nadministrative expense. The Firm has prefunded its\nU.S. postretirement benefit obligations. The U.K. OPEB\nplan is unfunded. Pension and OPEB accounting guidance\ngenerally requires that the difference between plan\nassets at fair value and the benefit obligation be\nmeasured and recorded on the balance sheet. Plans that\nare overfunded (excess of plan assets over benefit\nobligation) are recorded in other assets and plans\nthat are underfunded (excess benefit obligation over\nplan assets) are recorded in other liabilities. Gains\nor losses resulting from changes in the benefit\nobligation and the fair value of plan assets are\nrecorded in OCI and recognized as part of the net\nperiodic benefit cost over subsequent periods as\ndiscussed in the Gains and losses section of this\nNote.

Consideration is also given to\ncurrent market conditions and the portfolio mix of\neach plan. The discount rate used in determining the\nbenefit obligation under the U.S. defined benefit\npension plan was provided by the Firm’s actuaries.\nThis rate was selected by reference to the yields on\nportfolios of bonds with maturity dates and coupons\nthat closely match each of the plan’s projected cash\nflows.\nAt December 31, 2020, the Firm decreased the discount\nrates used to determine its benefit obligations for\nthe U.S. defined benefit pension plans in light of\ncurrent market interest rates, which is expected to\ndecrease expense by approximately $ 64million in 2021.\nThe 2021 expected long-term rate of return on U.S.\ndefined benefit pension plan assets is 3.00%.\nThe following table represents the effect of a 25-basis point decline in the expected long-term rate of return of\n3.00% and discount rate of 2.50%.\nEffect on U.S. defined benefit pension plans\n(in millions)                                      Pension expense    Benefit obligation\nExpected long-term rate of return               $               43                        NA\nDiscount rate                                                  -20                   404\n218    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nInvestment strategy and asset allocation The assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans are held in various\ntrusts and are invested in well-diversified portfolios of equity and fixed income securities, cash and cash\nequivalents, and alternative investments. The trust-owned assets of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan are invested\nprimarily in fixed income securities. COLI policies used to partially defray the cost of the Firm’s U.S. OPEB plan\nare invested in separate accounts of an insurance company and are allocated to investments intended to replicate\nequity and fixed income indices. The investment policies for the assets of the Firm’s defined benefit pension plans\nare to optimize the risk-return relationship as appropriate to the needs and goals of each plan. Assets are managed\nby a combination of internal and external investment managers. The Firm regularly reviews the asset allocations and\nasset managers, as well as other factors that could impact the portfolios, which are rebalanced when deemed\nnecessary. Investments held by the Firm’s defined benefit pension and OPEB plans include financial instruments\nwhich are exposed to various risks such as interest rate, market and credit risks. Exposure to a concentration of\ncredit risk is mitigated by the broad diversification of both U.S. and non-U.S. investments. Additionally, the\ninvestments in each of the collective investment funds and/or registered investment companies are further\ndiversified into various financial instruments. As of December 31, 2020, assets held by the Firm’s defined benefit\npension and OPEB plans do not include securities issued by JPMorgan Chase or its affiliates, except through\nindirect exposures through investments in ETFs, mutual funds and collective investment funds managed by third-\nparties. The defined benefit pension and OPEB plans hold investments that are sponsored or managed by affiliates of\nJPMorgan Chase in the amount of $ 2.7billion and $ 3.1billion, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table presents the weighted-average asset allocation of the fair values of total plan assets at\nDecember 31 for the years indicated, as well as the respective approved asset allocation ranges by asset class.\nU.S. defined benefit pension plan(c)\nAsset       % of plan assets\nDecember 31,                                    Allocation                   2020       2019\nAsset class\nDebt securities(a)                                 42-100%                     77  %      74  %\nEquity securities                                     0-40                     15         16\nReal estate                                            0-4                      1          1\nAlternatives(b)                                       0-15                      7          9\nTotal                                                  100  %                 100  %     100  %\n(a) Debt securities primarily includes cash and cash equivalents, corporate debt, U.S. federal, state, local and\nnon-U.S. government, asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities.\n(b) Alternatives primarily include limited partnerships.\n(c) Represents the U.S. defined benefit pension plan only as it is the most significant plan.

Under the terms of the LTIP, as of\nDecember 31, 2020, 67million shares of common stock were available for issuance through May 2022. The LTIP is the\nonly active plan under which the Firm is currently granting share-based incentive awards. In the following\ndiscussion, the LTIP, plus prior Firm plans and plans assumed as the result of acquisitions, are referred to\ncollectively as the “LTI Plans,” and such plans constitute the Firm’s share-based incentive plans. RSUs are awarded\nat no cost to the recipient upon their grant. Generally, RSUs are granted annually and vest at a rate of 50% after\ntwo yearsand 50% after three yearsand are converted into shares of common stock as of the vesting date. In\naddition, RSUs typically include full-career eligibility provisions, which allow employees to continue to vest upon\nvoluntary termination based on age or service-related requirements, subject to post-employment and other\nrestrictions. All RSU awards are subject to forfeiture until vested and contain clawback provisions that may result\nin cancellation under certain specified circumstances. Predominantly all RSUs entitle the recipient to receive cash\npayments equivalent to any dividends paid on the underlying common stock during the period the RSUs are\noutstanding. Performance share units (“PSUs”) are granted annually, and approved by the Firm’s Board of Directors,\nto members of the Firm’s Operating Committee under the variable compensation program. PSUs are subject to the\nFirm’s achievement of specified performance criteria over a three-year period. The number of awards that vest can\nrange from zeroto 150% of the grant amount. In addition, dividends that accrue during the vesting period are\nreinvested in dividend equivalent share units. PSUs and the related dividend equivalent share units are converted\ninto shares of common stock after vesting. Once the PSUs and dividend equivalent share units have vested, the\nshares of common stock that are delivered, after applicable tax withholding, must be held for an additional two-\nyear period, for a total combined vesting and holding period of approximately fiveto eightyears from the grant date\ndepending on regulations in certain countries. Under the LTI Plans, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and stock\noptions have generally been granted with an exercise price equal to the fair value of JPMorgan Chase’s common stock\non the grant date. SARs and stock options generally expire ten yearsafter the grant date. There were no material\ngrants of SARs or stock options in 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Firm separately recognizes compensation expense for\neach tranche of each award, net of estimated forfeitures, as if it were a separate award with its own vesting date.\nGenerally, for each tranche granted, compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant\ndate until the vesting date of the respective tranche, provided that the employees will not become full-career\neligible during the vesting period. For awards with full-career eligibility provisions and awards granted with no\nfuture substantive service requirement, the Firm accrues the estimated value of awards expected to be awarded to\nemployees as of the grant date without giving consideration to the impact of post-employment restrictions. For each\ntranche granted to employees who will become full-career eligible during the vesting period, compensation expense\nis recognized on a straight-line basis from the grant date until the earlier of the employee’s full-career\neligibility date or the vesting date of the respective tranche. The Firm’s policy for issuing shares upon\nsettlement of employee share-based incentive awards is to issue either new shares of common stock or treasury\nshares. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Firm settled all of its employee share-based awards by issuing treasury\nshares. Refer to Note 23 for further information on the classification of share-based awards for purposes of\ncalculating earnings per share.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    221\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nRSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity\nGenerally, compensation expense for RSUs and PSUs is measured based on the number of units granted multiplied by\nthe stock price at the grant date, and for SARs and stock options, is measured at the grant date using the Black-\nScholes valuation model. Compensation expense for these awards is recognized in net income as described previously.\nThe following table summarizes JPMorgan Chase’s RSUs, PSUs, SARs and stock options activity for 2020.\nWeighted-…\nYear                           Weighted-…                                       remaining\nended        RSUs/PSUs              grant        SARs/Opti…       Weighted-…    contractu…            Aggregate\nDecember     Number of          date fair         Number of         exercise    life                  intrinsic\n31, 2020         units              value            awards            price    (in years)                value\n(in\nthousand…\nexcept\nweighted…\ndata, and\nwhere\notherwise\nstated)\nOutstand…       52,239      $       99.62             5,527    $       41.36\nJanuary 1\nGranted         17,891             132.17                 1           137.80\nExercised      -21,502              96.64            -2,389            41.40\nor vested\nForfeited       -1,118             111.59                -4           122.59\nCanceled                NA                 NA           -11            39.33\nOutstand…\nDecember        47,510      $      112.85             3,124    $       41.25                1.4  $      265,059\n31\nExercisa…\nDecember                NA                 NA         3,124            41.25                1.4         265,059\n31\nThe total fair value of RSUs that vested during the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, was $\n2.8billion, $ 2.9billion and $ 3.6billion,\nrespectively.

Debt securities classified as\ntrading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury\nand CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. AFS securities are carried at fair value on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, after any applicable hedge accounting adjustments or\nallowance for credit losses, are reported in AOCI. The specific identification method is used to determine realized\ngains and losses on AFS securities, which are included in investment securities gains/(losses) on the Consolidated\nstatements of income. HTM securities, which the Firm has the intent and ability to hold until maturity, are carried\nat amortized cost, net of allowance for credit losses, on the Consolidated balance sheets. For both AFS and HTM\nsecurities, purchase discounts or premiums are generally amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over\nthe contractual life of the security. However, premiums on certain callable debt securities are amortized to the\nearliest call date. Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance, which also amended\nthe AFS securities impairment guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information. During 2020, the Firm transferred\n$ 164.2billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax\nunrealized gains of $ 5.0billion on the securities at the dates of transfer. Unrealized gains or losses at the date\nof transfer of these securities continue to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-\nyield basis over the remaining life of the securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income\nof the amortization of the premium or discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. Transfers of\nsecurities from AFS to HTM are non-cash transactions and are recorded at fair value.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    223\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates\nindicated.\nDece…\n31,\n(in\nmill…\nAvai…\nsecu…         2020        Gross        Gross                       2019        Gross         Gross\nMort…       Amort…       unrea…       unrea…         Fair       Amorti…       unrea…       unreal…         Fair\nsecu…       cost(…        gains       losses        value       cost(e)        gains        losses        value\nU.S.\nGSEs\nand      $  110,9…    $   2,372    $      50    $  113,3…    $  107,811    $   2,395    $       89    $  110,1…\ngove…\nagen…\nResi…\nU.S.         6,246          224            3        6,467        10,223          233             6       10,450\nNon-…        3,751           20            5        3,766         2,477           64             1        2,540\nComm…        2,819           71           34        2,856         5,137           64            13        5,188\nTotal\nmort…       123,7…        2,687           92       126,3…       125,648        2,756           109       128,2…\nsecu…\nU.S.\nTrea…\nand         199,9…        2,141          100       201,9…       139,162          449           175       139,4…\ngove…\nagen…\nObli…\nof\nU.S.        18,993        1,404            1       20,396        27,693        2,118             1       29,810\nstat…\nand\nmuni…\nCert…\nof               —            —            —            —            77            —             —           77\ndepo…\nNon-…\ngove…       22,587          354           13       22,928        21,427          377            17       21,787\ndebt\nsecu…\nCorp…\ndebt           215            4            3          216           823           22             —          845\nsecu…\nAsse…\nsecu…\nColl…\nloan        10,055           24           31       10,048        25,038            9            56       24,991\nobli…\nOther        6,174           91           16        6,249         5,438           40            20        5,458\nTotal\navai…       381,7…        6,705          256       388,1…       345,306        5,771           378       350,6…\nsecu…\nHeld…\nsecu…\nMort…\nsecu…\nU.S.\nGSEs\nand         107,8…        2,968           29       110,8…        36,523        1,165            62       37,626\ngove…\nagen…\nU.S.         4,345            8           30        4,323             —            —             —            —\nResi…\nComm…        2,602           77            —        2,679             —            —             —            —\nTotal\nmort…       114,8…        3,053           59       117,8…        36,523        1,165            62       37,626\nsecu…\nU.S.\nTrea…\nand         53,184           50            —       53,234            51            —             1           50\ngove…\nagen…\nObli…\nof\nU.S.        12,751          519            —       13,270         4,797          299             —        5,096\nstat…\nand\nmuni…\nAsse…\nsecu…\nColl…\nloan        21,050           90            2       21,138         6,169            —             —        6,169\nobli…\nTotal\nheld…\nsecu…\nnet\nof          201,8…        3,712           61       205,4…        47,540        1,464            63       48,941\nallo…\nfor\ncred…\nloss…\nTotal\ninve…\nsecu…\nnet\nof       $  583,5…    $  10,417    $     317    $  593,6…    $  392,846    $   7,235    $      441    $  399,6…\nallo…\nfor\ncred…\nloss…\n(a) Includes AFS U.S. GSE obligations with fair values of $ 65.8billion and $ 78.5billion, and HTM U.S. GSE\nobligations with amortized cost of $ 86.3billion and $ 31.6billion, at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

AFS\nsecurities are considered impaired if the fair value\nis less than the amortized cost. The Firm recognizes\nimpairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the\nintent to sell the debt security, or if it is more\nlikely than not that the Firm will be required to sell\nthe debt security before recovery of its amortized\ncost. In these circumstances the impairment loss\nrecognized in investment securities gains/(losses) is\nequal to the full difference between the amortized\ncost (net of allowance if applicable) and the fair\nvalue of the securities. For impaired debt securities\nthat the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the\nsecurities are evaluated to determine if a credit loss\nexists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists,\nthat loss is recognized as an allowance for credit\nlosses through the provision for credit losses in the\nConsolidated Statements of Income, limited by the\namount of impairment. Any impairment not due to credit\nlosses is recorded in OCI. Factors considered in\nevaluating credit losses include adverse conditions\nspecifically related to the industry, geographic area\nor financial condition of the issuer or underlying\ncollateral of a security; and payment structure of the\nsecurity. When assessing securities issued in a\nsecuritization for credit losses, the Firm estimates\ncash flows considering relevant market and economic\ndata, underlying loan-level data, and structural\nfeatures of the securitization, such as subordination,\nexcess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of\ncredit enhancement, and compares the losses projected\nfor the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against\nthe level of credit enhancement in the securitization\nstructure to determine whether these features are\nsufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a\ncredit loss exists. For beneficial interests in\nsecuritizations that are rated below “AA” at their\nacquisition, or that can be contractually prepaid or\notherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would\nnot recover substantially all of its recorded\ninvestment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit\nlosses when there is an adverse change in expected\ncash flows. Allowance for credit losses Based on its\nassessment, the Firm did not recognize an allowance\nfor credit losses on impaired AFS securities as of\nJanuary 1, 2020 or December 31, 2020.\n226    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nHTM securities – credit risk The adoption of the CECL\naccounting guidance requires management to estimate\nexpected credit losses on HTM securities over the\nremaining expected life and recognize this estimate as\nan allowance for credit losses. As a result of the\nadoption of this guidance, the Firm recognized an\nallowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S.\nstates and municipalities of $ 10million as a\ncumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as\nof January 1, 2020. Credit quality indicator The\nprimary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is\nthe risk rating assigned to each security. At December\n31, 2020, all HTM securities were rated investment\ngrade and were current and accruing, with\napproximately 98% rated at least AA+. Allowance for\ncredit losses The allowance for credit losses on HTM\nobligations of U.S. states and municipalities and\ncommercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by\napplying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD\nand LGD) to the amortized cost. The credit loss\nfactors are derived using a weighted average of five\ninternally developed eight-quarter macroeconomic\nscenarios, followed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical\ninformation for periods beyond the forecast period.\nRefer to Note 13 for further information on the eight-\nquarter macroeconomic forecast. The allowance for\ncredit losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations\nand U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities is\ncalculated as the difference between the amortized\ncost and the present value of the cash flows expected\nto be collected, discounted at the security’s\neffective interest rate. These cash flow estimates are\ndeveloped based on expectations of underlying\ncollateral performance derived using the eight-quarter\nmacroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-\nline interpolation, as well as considering the\nstructural features of the security. The application\nof different inputs and assumptions into the\ncalculation of the allowance for credit losses is\nsubject to significant management judgment, and\nemphasizing one input or assumption over another, or\nconsidering other inputs or assumptions, could affect\nthe estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM\nsecurities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM\nsecurities was $ 78million as of December 31, 2020,\nreflecting $ 68million recognized in the provision for\ncredit losses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nSelected impacts of investment securities on the\nConsolidated statements of income\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                    2020       2019

Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted\nbased on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are\nused where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual\nmaturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be\nprepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years\nor more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately 5years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n228    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNote 11 – Securities financing activities\nJPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively,\n“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover\nshort sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s\nexcess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the\nsame counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets\nand liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the\nlife of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm\nhas elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option\nhas been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements\ncarried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense,\nwith changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments\ncontaining embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for\nhybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal\ntransactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at\namortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold\nany allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of December 31, 2020\nand 2019. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm primarily to credit and\nliquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying securities (predominantly\nhigh-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and government agencies MBS)\nthat it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash proceeds and exchanged\ncollateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral when appropriate. Margin\nlevels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying securities, and the\npermissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities borrowed agreements, the\nFirm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is less than initial cash\nprincipal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned agreements, credit\nrisk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the value of the\ninitial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm typically enters into\nmaster netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which provide for the right to\nliquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a counterparty default. It\nis also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying resale and securities\nborrowed agreements. Refer to Note 29 for further information regarding assets pledged and collateral received in\nsecurities financing agreements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    229\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements, as of December\n31, 2020 and 2019. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting\nagreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same\ncounterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the\neconomic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet\npresentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master\nnetting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant\nnetting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented.

The Firm\naccounts for loans based on the following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e.,\n“retained”) • Loans held-for-sale • Loans at fair value Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL\naccounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The following provides a detailed accounting\ndiscussion of the Firm’s loans by category: Loans held-for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-\ninvestment are recorded at the principal amount outstanding, net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to\nprincipal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net\ndeferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include billed finance charges and fees. Interest income\nInterest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued and recognized as interest income at the\ncontractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are\namortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies\naccrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, in accrued interest and\naccounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans, accrued interest once billed is\nthen recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the allowance for credit losses.\nChanges in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans are recognized in the provision\nfor credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. Expected losses related to accrued\ninterest on certain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in the Firm’s\nallowance for loan losses. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on\naccrued interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by\nreversing interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been\nsuspended. Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are\nplaced on nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not\nexpected, regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90\ndays or more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be\npast due when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for\ncertain loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more.\nFinally, collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on\nnonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the\namortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash\ninterest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible;\nhowever, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash\nreceipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans,\napplication of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans\non a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been\ndemonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As\npermitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status;\naccordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or\npaid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit\nlosses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet\nas a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan\nlosses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to\nNote 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs\nConsumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the lower of the amortized cost or the net realizable\nvalue of the underlying collateral (i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance\nfor loan losses, upon reaching specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the\nFFIEC. Residential real estate loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally\ncharged off no later than 180days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later\nthan 120days past due.\n232    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nCertain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-\noff standards in certain circumstances as follows: • Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-\ndependent. • Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly\ncertain are subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged\noff or charged down within 60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon repossession\nof the automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs\non the government-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a\nloss has been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the\nprioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and\nvaluation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the lower of its\namortized cost or the estimated net realizable value of the underlying collateral, the determination of the fair\nvalue of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g., securities, real estate). In cases where the\ncollateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is based on quoted market prices or broker quotes.\nFor illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value of the collateral is generally estimated using a\ndiscounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans, collateral values are based upon external valuation\nsources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s\nprice opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation\n(“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every twelve months, or more frequently depending on various\nmarket factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by\ntaking legal title or physical possession), the Firm generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that\nincludes the interior of the home (“interior appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted\nbased upon the Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by\nexterior opinions and interior appraisals, considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans,\ncollateral values are generally based on appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values\nare typically updated every sixto twelve months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal\nanalysis, in accordance with the Firm’s policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific\nfactors, which may result in obtaining appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans\nheld-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded\nin noninterest revenue. For consumer loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans,\nthe valuation is performed on an individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and\nrecognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts\nor premiums are deferred in a contra loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and\ndiscounts or premiums are an adjustment to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic\ndetermination of the lower of cost or fair value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of\nsale. Because these loans are recognized at the lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses\nand charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual\npolicies described above. Loans at fair value Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured\nat fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is\naccrued and recognized based on the contractual rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in\nnoninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs\nare recognized in the associated expense category as incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value,\nthe Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair\nvalue are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s\nelections of fair value accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information\non loans carried at fair value and classified as trading assets.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    233\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are\ntransferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-\nrelated losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to\nchanges in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event\nthat management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-\ninvestment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for\nimpairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the\nmethodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to\nmodify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase\ngrants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the\nFirm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments\nreceived by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific\ncharacteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness,\nor the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported\nas TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not\nTDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in\nmany cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to\nperforming status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has\nperformed under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an\nexpectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt\ncapacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In\ncertain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans\nare not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for\nimpairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-\ndefault rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific\ncomponent of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been\nreturned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s\nasset-specific allowance. The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19\nrelated loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because: • they represent short-term or other\ninsignificant modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by\nregulatory guidance, or • the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting\nguidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. To the extent\nthat certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. As permitted\nby regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status\nwhere such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and\naccrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses.\nAssistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual\nstatus, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status.\nForeclosed property The Firm acquires property from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and\nforeclosures. Property acquired may include real property (e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and\ncommercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles, aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed\nproperty upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For\nloans collateralized by real property, the Firm generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon\nthe execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in\nother assets on the Consolidated balance sheets and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to\nsell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of\ncost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating\nexpense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance, are charged to other expense. In response to the COVID-19\npandemic, the Firm has temporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This could delay recognition of\nforeclosed properties until the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.\n234    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nLoan portfolio\nThe Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to\ndetermine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each\nportfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the\nrisk characteristics of each loan class.\nIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm revised its loan classes. Prior-period amounts have been revised\nto conform with the current presentation:\nThe consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment’s residential mortgage and home equity loans and lending-\nrelated commitments have been combined into a residential real estate class.\nUpon adoption of CECL, the Firm elected to discontinue the pool-level accounting for PCI loans and to account for\nthese loans on an individual loan basis. PCI loans are considered PCD loans under CECL and are subject to the\nFirm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies. PCD loans are now reported in the consumer, excluding credit card\nportfolio segment’s residential real estate class.\nRisk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related commitments held in CCB were reclassified\nfrom the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment, to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied when determining the allowance. The remaining scored auto and business banking loans and\nlending-related commitments have been combined into an auto and other class.\nThe wholesale portfolio segment’s classes, previously based on the borrower’s primary business activity, have\nbeen revised to align with the loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan’s\ncollateral, purpose, and type of borrower.\nConsumer, excluding             Credit card            Wholesale(c)\ncredit card\nResidential real estate(a)                           • Secured by real estate\nAuto and other(b)             • Credit card loans    • Commercial and industrial\nOther(d)\n(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB and\nCorporate.\n(b) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.\n(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans\nheld in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.\n(d) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal\ninvestment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Wealth\nManagement clients within AWM).

The portfolio also includes home equity\nloans secured by junior liens, prime mortgage loans\nwith an interest-only payment period, and certain\npayment-option loans that may result in negative\namortization.\nThe following table provides information about\nretained consumer loans, excluding credit card, by\nclass.\nDecember 31, (in millions)                2020              2019\nResidential real estate       $  225,302        $  243,317\nAuto and other(a)                 76,825            51,682\nTotal retained loans          $  302,127        $  294,999\n(a) At December 31, 2020, included $ 19.2billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP.\nDelinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days\npast due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be\nunable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is\nlikely to be unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies\n(greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or\nsimilar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer\nloans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV\nratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity\nin the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued\nwillingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the\nborrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as\nto the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific\nevents such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a\nsecondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit\npayment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660) is considered to be of higher\nrisk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a\nlow FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high\nFICO score. • For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit\nperformance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights\ninto the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    237\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nResidential real estate\nThe following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained\nresidential real estate loans.\n…\n…\n…\n…                        …               …\n…\n…                …       …\n…        …        …        …        …                …       …\n…                …       …\n…       …\n$  …     $  …     $  …     $  …     $  …     $  …            $  …     $  …            $  …              …\n9        …        …        …        …        …               …        …               …              …\n3        …        …        …        …        …               …        …               …              …\n$  …     $  …     $  …     $  …     $  …     $  …            $  …     $  …            $  …              …\n…  %     …  %     …  %     …  %     …  %     …  %            …  %     …  %            …  %           …\n(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows:\ncurrent included $ 36million and $ 17million; 30–149 days past due included $ 16million and $ 20million; and 150 or\nmore days past due included $ 24million and $ 26million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(b) At December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which\nare still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not\nconsidered delinquent.\n(c) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government\nagencies of $ 40million and $ 46million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due.

Revolving loans that have\nbeen converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.\nThat is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than\nthe minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.\n238    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential\nreal estate loans.\n(in millions, except weighted-average\ndata)                                                   December 31, 2020              December 31, 2019\nNonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)             $    5,313                     $    2,780\n90 or more days past due and government             33                             38\nguaranteed(f)\nCurrent estimated LTV ratios(g)(h)\nGreater than 125% and refreshed FICO\nscores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                $       10                     $       31\nLess than 660                                       18                             38\n101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                        72                            134\nLess than 660                                       65                            132\n80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                     2,365                          5,953\nLess than 660                                      435                            764\nLess than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                   208,457                        219,469\nLess than 660                                   12,072                         14,681\nNo FICO/LTV available                            1,732                          2,052\nU.S. government-guaranteed                          76                             63\nTotal retained loans                        $  225,302                     $  243,317\nWeighted average LTV ratio(g)(i)                    54  %                          55  %\nWeighted average FICO(h)(i)                        763                            758\nGeographic region(j)\nCalifornia                                  $   73,444                     $   82,147\nNew York                                        32,287                         31,996\nFlorida                                         13,981                         13,668\nTexas                                           13,773                         14,474\nIllinois                                        13,130                         15,587\nColorado                                         8,235                          8,447\nWashington                                       7,917                          8,990\nNew Jersey                                       7,227                          7,752\nMassachusetts                                    5,784                          6,210\nConnecticut                                      5,024                          4,954\nAll other(k)                                    44,500                         49,092\nTotal retained loans                        $  225,302                     $  243,317\n(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the lower of amortized\ncost or the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

Delinquency\nrates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that\nborrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been\ndelinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the\ngeographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the\nregional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does\nnot view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a\nlagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the\nportfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance.\nRefreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random\nsample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry\nbenchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However,\ncertain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes\nin the credit score calculation.\nThe following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained\ncredit card loans.\n(in millions,                                                                                  December 31,\nexcept ratios)        December 31, 2020                                                        2019\nWithin the            Converted to term\nrevolving                      loans(b)        Total                      Total\nperiod\nLoan\ndelinquency(a)\nCurrent and\nless than 30\ndays past          $            139,783     $  1,239     $  141,022                $  165,767\ndueand still\naccruing\n30–89 days past\ndue and still                       997           94          1,091                     1,550\naccruing\n90 or more days\npast due and                      1,277           42          1,319                     1,607\nstill\naccruing\nTotal retained     $            142,057     $  1,375     $  143,432                $  168,924\nloans\nLoan\ndelinquency\nratios\n% of 30+ days\npast due to                        1.60  %      9.89  %        1.68  %                   1.87  %\ntotal retained\nloans\n% of 90+ days\npast due to                        0.90         3.05           0.92                      0.95\ntotal retained\nloans\n(a) At December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which\nare still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not\nconsidered delinquent.\n(b) Represents TDRs.\nOther credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on other credit quality indicators for retained credit card loans.\n(in millions, except ratios)                           December 31, 2020              December 31, 2019\nGeographic region(a)\nCalifornia                                 $   20,921                     $   25,783\nTexas                                          14,544                         16,728\nNew York                                       11,919                         14,544\nFlorida                                         9,562                         10,830\nIllinois                                        8,006                          9,579\nNew Jersey                                      5,927                          7,165\nOhio                                            4,673                          5,406\nPennsylvania                                    4,476                          5,245\nColorado                                        4,092                          4,763\nMichigan                                        3,553                          4,164\nAll other                                      55,759                         64,717\nTotal retained loans                       $  143,432                     $  168,924\nPercentage of portfolio based on\ncarrying value with estimated refreshed\nFICO scores\nEqual to or greater than 660                     85.9  %                        84.0  %\nLess than 660                                    13.9                           15.4\nNo FICO available                                 0.2                            0.6\n(a) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan\nbalances at December 31, 2020.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    243\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm may offer one of a number of loan\nmodification programs granting concessions to credit\ncard borrowers who are experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of\nthe credit card loans under long-term programs. These\nmodifications involve placing the customer on a fixed\npayment plan, generally for 60months, and typically\ninclude reducing the interest rate on the credit card.\nSubstantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-\nterm programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with\nshort-term or other insignificant modifications that\nare not considered concessions are not TDRs. If the\ncardholder does not comply with the modified payment\nterms, then the credit card loan continues to age and\nwill ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the\nFirm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the\nFirm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.\nFinancial effects of modifications and redefaults\nThe following table provides information about the\nfinancial effects of the concessions granted on credit\ncard loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the\nperiods presented.

The amounts presented represent the\nbalance of such loans as of the end of the quarter in\nwhich they defaulted.\nFor credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment\ndefault is deemed to have occurred when the borrower\nmisses twoconsecutive contractual payments. Defaulted\nmodified credit card loans remain in the modification\nprogram and continue to be charged off in accordance\nwith the Firm’s standard charge-off policy.\n244    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nWholesale loan portfolio\nWholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients\nto high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating\nassigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within\nthe portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will\ndefault. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and\ntakes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several\nfactors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial\nflexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of\ncontingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s\ninternal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet\nfinancial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however\nthe quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and\nassumptions. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3\nor higher as investment grade, and these ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade\nratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized\nportion is further subdivided into performing and nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the\ncollectibility of principal and interest. Criticized loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s\ndefinition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist\nof special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis\nby Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to\nfulfill its obligations. As noted above, the risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor\nconducts its operations. As part of the overall credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the\nmanagement and diversification of its industry and client exposures, with particular attention paid to industries\nwith actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4 for further detail on industry concentrations.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    245\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for\nretained wholesale loans.\n…\n…\n…                        …                                                         …\n…                        …                               …                         …\n…                …       …       …               …       …                2…       …       2…\n$  …     $  …            $  …       …    $  …            $  …     $  …             $  …       -a    $  …\n…        …               …               …               …        …                …                …\n…        …               …               …               …        …                …                …\n…        …               …               …               …        …                …                …\n…        …               …               …               …        …                …                …\n$  …     $  …            $  …            $  …            $  …     $  …             $  …             $  …\n…  %     …  %            …  %            …  %            …  %     …  %             …  %             …  %\n…        …               …               …               …        …                …                …\n…        …               …               …               …        …                …                …\nS…\nby\nr…\ne…\nD…                                                                                                   D…\n…       3…                                                                                                   3…\n…       2…                                                                                                   2…\n…\n…                                                          Re…\n…                                                          lo…\n…\n…\nP…             Wi…       C…\n…       2…       2…       2…       2…       to             the       to            To…             To…\n2…             re…       t…\npe…       l…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  1…    $  1…    $  1…    $  1…    $  1…    $  1…           $  1…    $  —           $  9…           $  9…\n…       3…       4…       4…       2…       2…       1…              4…       1              2…              2…\n…\n…    $  1…    $  2…    $  1…    $  1…    $  1…    $  2…           $  1…    $  1           $  1…           $  1…\n…\nC…\na…\ni…\nD…                                                                                                    …\n…       3…                                                                                                    …\n…       2…                                                                                                    …\n…\n…                                                                …\n…                                                                …\n…\n…\nP…             …       C…\n…             2…       2…       2…       2…       to             …       to            T…            T…\n2…             …       t…\n…       l…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  2…    -a    $  7…    $  2…    $  1…    $  1…    $  1…         $  3…    $  1          $  …          $  …\n…       1…             8…       5…       2…       4…       2…            3…       …             …             …\n…\n…    $  3…          $  1…    $  8…    $  3…    $  1…    $  3…         $  7…    $  …          $  …          $  …\n…\nO…\nD…                                                                                                   D…\n…       3…                                                                                                   3…\n…       2…                                                                                                   2…\n…\n…                                                          R…\n…                                                          l…\n…\n…\nP…             W…       C…\n…       2…       2…       2…       2…       to             t…       to             To…             To…\n2…             r…       t…\np…       l…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…    $  3…    $  1…    $  6…    $  6…    $  3…    $  1…          $  1…    $  7…           $  2…           $  1…\n…       5…       2…       1…       5…       1…       6…             2…       1…              3…              2…\n…\n…    $  3…    $  1…    $  8…    $  6…    $  3…    $  1…          $  1…    $  9…           $  2…           $  2…\n…\n(a) At December 31, 2020, included $ 8.0billion of loans under the PPP, of which $ 7.4billion is included in\ncommercial and industrial.

Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not\nconsidered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the\napplication of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated\nAppropriations Act. The carrying value of TDRs was $ 954million and $ 501million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 734million, $ 407million and $ 718million for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not\nmaterial to the Firm for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    247\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 13 – Allowance for credit losses\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance established\na single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet\ncredit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s\nremaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for\nfurther information. JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which\ncovers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets, • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the Consolidated balance\nsheets in accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities,\nwhich covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is recognized within Investment Securities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. The income statement effect of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the\nprovision for credit losses. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and\nrequires significant judgment by management about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least\nquarterly, the allowance for credit losses is reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm.\nSubsequent evaluations of credit exposures, considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors\nthen prevailing, may result in significant changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm’s\npolicies used to determine its allowance for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are\ndescribed in the following paragraphs. Refer to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the\nallowance for credit losses on investment securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments The allowance for loan losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents expected\ncredit losses over the remaining expected life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not\nunconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable\nlending-related commitments (e.g., credit cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans\nand certain performing, modified loans to borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are considered in the Firm’s allowance for\nloan losses. However, the Firm does not record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its\npolicy to write these receivables off no later than 90 days past due by reversing interest income. The expected\nlife of each instrument is determined by considering its contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation\nfeatures, and certain extension and call options. The expected life of funded credit card loans is generally\nestimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card account, and determining how much of those\namounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as of the balance sheet date) versus other\naccount activity. This allocation is made using an approach that incorporates the payment application requirements\nof the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest\ninterest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses includes expected recoveries of amounts\npreviously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such recoveries result in a negative allowance.\nCollective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-\nrelated commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar risk characteristics. If similar risk\ncharacteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses collectively, considering the risk associated with\na particular pool and the probability that the exposures within the pool will deteriorate or default. The\nassessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management judgment. Emphasizing one characteristic\nover another or considering additional characteristics could affect the allowance. • Relevant risk characteristics\nfor the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status, current FICO scores, geographic distribution,\nand, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. • Relevant risk characteristics for the wholesale portfolio\ninclude LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency status, level and type of collateral, industry, credit\nenhancement, product type, facility purpose, tenor, and payment terms. The majority of the Firm’s credit exposures\nshare risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are collectively assessed for impairment\n(“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer loans, performing risk-rated loans and\ncertain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk characteristics with other exposures, the\nFirm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis, considering expected repayment and\nconditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The asset-specific component covers\nmodified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR, collateral-dependent loans, as\nwell as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-based component The portfolio-based\ncomponent begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood of the borrower changing delinquency\nstatus or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation covers expected credit losses over\nan instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors to the Firm’s\n248    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nestimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower default as well as\nloss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year straight-line\ninterpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter forecast period.\nThe five macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and\nextreme upside scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into\nconsideration the Firm’s overarching economic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the\nFirm, and market consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across\nLOBs, Corporate Finance and Risk Management. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs to degrees not\nexperienced in recent history, which has created additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates\nand increased the reliance on management judgment. In periods where certain MEVs are outside the range of\nhistorical experience on which the Firm’s models have been trained, the Firm makes adjustments to appropriately\naddress these economic circumstances. The Firm also considers the impact of other events, such as government\nunemployment benefits or other stimulus programs, when determining whether adjustments are necessary. The\nquantitative calculation is adjusted to take into consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments,\ntrends and other subjective factors that are not yet reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are\naccomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss experience, including during stressed periods, for each major\nproduct or model. Management applies judgment in making this adjustment, including taking into account\nuncertainties associated with the economic and political conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower\nbehavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an industry, product or portfolio, as well as other\nrelevant internal and external factors affecting the credit quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the\ninterrelationships between these factors create further uncertainties. Throughout 2020, the Firm made adjustments\nto its quantitative calculation which placed significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, as a result of\ncontinued uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The application of different inputs into the quantitative\ncalculation, and the assumptions used by management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to\nsignificant management judgment, and emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs\nor assumptions, could affect the estimate of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments. Asset-specific component To determine the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-\ndependent loans (including those loans for which foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans\nin the wholesale portfolio segment are generally evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-\nrated) are aggregated for evaluation using factors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm generally\nmeasures the asset-specific allowance as the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present\nvalue of the cash flows expected to be collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate.\nSubsequent changes in impairment are generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For\ncollateral-dependent loans, the fair value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the\ncharge-off amount for declines in value (to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral)\nor the amount of negative allowance that should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with\nimprovements in the fair value of collateral). The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan losses for\nloans that have been or are expected to be modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the\nloan’s expected cash flows (including forgone interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and\nalso the potential for redefault. For residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs,\nthe Firm develops product-specific probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute\nexpected losses. In developing these probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the\ncredit quality characteristics of the underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and\nunemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date\nbased on actual redefaulted modified loans. For credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs,\nexpected losses incorporate projected delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm’s historical experience by\ntype of modification program. For wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses\nincorporate management’s expectation of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the\ntiming and amounts of future cash flows is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates\nsuch as loss severities, asset valuations, default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts\nand timing of interest or principal payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are\nreflective of current and expected market conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as\nthe duration of current overall economic conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or borrower-specific factors, the\nexpected outcome of insolvency proceedings as well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of\nthese estimates and assumptions require significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly\nsubjective.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    249\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nAllowance for credit losses and related information\nThe table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and\nincludes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. Refer to Note 10 for\nfurther information on the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.\nThe adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are\nconsidered PCD loans. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-\nrelated commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment,\nto align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to\nconform with the current presentation.

A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was removed from a pool.\n(b) Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a\nTDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment.\nThe asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is\ncalculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty\nrates.\n(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.\n(d) At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, lending-related commitments excluded $ 19.5billion, $ 9.8billion and $\n8.7billion, respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 658.5billion, $ 650.7billion\nand $ 605.4billion, respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 22.4billion, $ 24.1billion and $\n24.8billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for\nlending-related commitments.\n(e) Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $ 78million and a provision for credit\nlosses of $ 68million as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n(t…\nco…\nfr…\npr…\npa…\n20…                                                      20…\nCo…                                                      Co…\nex…                                                      ex…\ncr…           Cr…                                        cr…           Cre…\nca…           ca…           Wh…           Tot…           ca…           card           Wh…           Tot…\n$  3,…        $  5,…        $  4,…        $  13,…        $  3,…        $  4,8…        $  4,…        $  13,…\nNA            NA            NA             NA            NA             NA            NA             NA\n902           5,…           472           6,8…           977           5,0…           361           6,3…\n-5…           -5…           -57           -1,…           -8…           -493           -1…           -1,…\n366           4,…           415           5,6…           150           4,5…           188           4,8…\n151             —             —            151           187              —             —            187\n-3…           5,…           479           5,4…           -1…           4,8…           188           4,8…\n-1            -1            11              9             —              —            -1             -1\n$  2,…        $  5,…        $  4,…        $  13,…        $  3,…        $  5,1…        $  4,…        $  13,…\n$   12        $    —        $  1,…        $  1,0…        $   12        $     —        $  1,…        $  1,0…\nNA            NA            NA             NA            NA             NA            NA             NA\n—             —           136            136             —              —           -14            -14\n—             —             —              —             —              —             1              1\n$   12        $    —        $  1,…        $  1,1…        $   12        $     —        $  1,…        $  1,0…\n$  2,…        $  5,…        $  6,…        $  14,…        $  3,…        $  5,1…        $  5,…        $  14,…\n$   75        $  477        $  295        $   847        $  143        $   440        $  350        $   933\n1,…           5,…           4,…           11,…           1,…           4,7…           4,…           10,…\n987             —             —            987           1,…              —             —           1,7…\n$  2,…        $  5,…        $  4,…        $  13,…        $  3,…        $  5,1…        $  4,…        $  13,…\n$  5,…        $  1,…        $  1,…        $  8,5…        $  6,…        $  1,3…        $  1,…        $  9,4…\n26…           16…           48…           916…           30…           155…           47…           935…\n20…             —             —           20,…           24…              —             3           24,…\n$  29…        $  16…        $  48…        $  945…        $  33…        $  156…        $  47…        $  969…\n$   46        $    —        $   36        $    82        $   16        $     —        $   29        $    45\n2,…             —            87           2,1…           2,…              —           206           2,2…\n$    —        $    —        $  102        $   102        $    —        $     —        $   99        $    99\n12             —           1,…           1,0…            12              —           944            956\n$   12        $    —        $  1,…        $  1,1…        $   12        $     —        $  1,…        $  1,0…\n$    —        $    —        $  474        $   474        $    —        $     —        $  469        $   469\n30…             —           39…           423…           26…              —           37…           401…\n$  30…        $    —        $  39…        $  423…        $  26…        $     —        $  37…        $  401…\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    251\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance during 2020 The\nincrease in the allowance for loan losses and lending-\nrelated commitments was primarily driven by an\nincrease in the provision for credit losses,\nreflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty around\nthe future macroeconomic environment as a result of\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December\n31, 2020, the Firm’s central case reflected U.S.\nunemployment rates of approximately 7% through the\nsecond quarter of 2021 and remaining above 5% until\nthe second half of 2022. This compared with relatively\nlow levels of unemployment of approximately 4%\nthroughout 2020 and 2021 in the Firm’s January 1, 2020\ncentral case. Further, while the Firm’s January 1,\n2020 central case U.S. GDP forecast reflected a 1.7%\nexpansion in 2020, actual U.S. GDP contracted\napproximately 2.5% in 2020. As of December 31, 2020,\nthe Firm’s central case assumptions reflect a return\nto pre-pandemic GDP levels in the fourth quarter of\n2021. Due to elevated uncertainty in the near term\noutlook, driven by the potential for increased\ninfection rates and related lock downs resulting from\nthe pandemic, as well as the prospect that government\nand other consumer relief measures set to expire may\nnot be extended, the Firm has placed significant\nweighting on its adverse scenarios. These scenarios\nincorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than\nthe central case assumptions, resulting in weighted\naverage U.S. unemployment rates remaining elevated\nthroughout 2021 and 2022, ending the fourth quarter of\n2022 at approximately 6%, and in U.S. GDP ending 2022\napproximately 0.9% higher than fourth quarter 2019\nactual pre-pandemic levels.\nThe Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:\nAssumptions at January 1, 2020\n2Q20                              4Q20(b)    2Q21\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                  3.7%                              3.8%       4.0%\nCumulative change in U.S. real GDP from    0.9%                              1.7%       2.4%\n12/31/2019\nAssumptions at December 31, 2020\n2Q21                                4Q21    2Q22\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                  6.8%                                5.7%    5.1%\nCumulative change in U.S. real GDP from    (1.9)%                              0.6%    2.0%\n12/31/2019\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S. unemployment rate.\n(b) 4Q20 actual U.S. unemployment rate (quarterly average) was 6.8%. 4Q20 actual cumulative change in U.S. real GDP\nfrom 4Q19 was (2.5%).\nSubsequent changes to this forecast and related\nestimates will be reflected in the provision for\ncredit losses in future periods.\n252    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNote 14 – Variable interest entities\nRefer to Note 1 on page 167 for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding\nconsolidation of VIEs.\nThe following table summarizes the most significant types of Firm-sponsored VIEs by business segment. The Firm\nconsiders a “sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorgan Chase is the primary beneficiary of the\nstructure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorgan Chase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial\ninstruments with the JPMorgan Chase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorgan Chase–administered asset-backed\ncommercial paper conduit.\nLine of Business               Transaction Type                                     Activity    2020 Form 10-K\npage references\nCCB                            Credit card securitization       Securitization of originated    253-254\ntrusts                                credit card receivables\nServicing and securitization\nMortgage securitization        of both originated and                                254-256\ntrusts                         purchased residential\nmortgages\nSecuritization of both\nMortgage and other                   originated and purchased\nCIB                            securitization trusts              residential and commercial    254-256\nmortgages, and other\nconsumer loans\nAssist clients in accessing\nthe financial markets in a\nMulti-seller conduits          cost-efficient manner and                                 256\nstructures transactions to\nmeet investor needs\nMunicipal bond vehicles        Financing of municipal bond                           256-257\ninvestments\nThe Firm’s other business segments are also involved with VIEs (both third-party and Firm-sponsored), but to a\nlesser extent, as follows:\nAsset & Wealth Management: AWM sponsors and manages certain funds that are deemed VIEs. As asset manager of the\nfunds, AWM earns a fee based on assets managed; the fee varies with each fund’s investment objective and is\ncompetitively priced. For fund entities that qualify as VIEs, AWM’s interests are, in certain cases, considered to\nbe significant variable interests that result in consolidation of the financial results of these entities.\nCommercial Banking: CB provides financing and lending-related services to a wide spectrum of clients, including\ncertain third-party-sponsored entities that may meet the definition of a VIE. CB does not control the activities of\nthese entities and does not consolidate these entities. CB’s maximum loss exposure, regardless of whether the\nentity is a VIE, is generally limited to loans and lending-related commitments which are reported and disclosed in\nthe same manner as any other third-party transaction.\nCorporate : Corporate is involved with entities that may meet the definition of VIEs; however these entities are\ngenerally subject to specialized investment company accounting, which does not require the consolidation of\ninvestments, including VIEs. In addition, Treasury and CIO invest in securities generally issued by third parties\nwhich may meet the definition of VIEs (e.g., issuers of asset-backed securities). In general, the Firm does not\nhave the power to direct the significant activities of these entities and therefore does not consolidate these\nentities. Refer to Note 10 for further information on the Firm’s investment securities portfolio.\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing and other services to VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nRefer to page 258 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third parties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored variable interest entities\nCredit card securitizations CCB’s Card business may securitize originated credit card loans, primarily through the\nChase Issuance Trust (the “Trust”). The Firm’s continuing involvement in credit card securitizations includes\nservicing the receivables, retaining an undivided seller’s interest in the receivables, retaining certain senior\nand subordinated securities and maintaining escrow accounts. The Firm consolidates the assets and liabilities of\nits sponsored credit card trusts as it is considered to be the primary beneficiary of these securitization trusts\nbased on the Firm’s ability to direct the activities of these VIEs through its servicing responsibilities and other\nduties, including making decisions as to the receivables that are transferred into those trusts and as to any\nrelated modifications and workouts. Additionally, the nature and extent of the Firm’s other continuing involvement\nwith the trusts, as indicated above, obligates the Firm to absorb losses and gives the Firm the right to receive\ncertain benefits from these VIEs that could potentially be significant. The underlying securitized credit card\nreceivables and other assets of the securitization trusts are available only for payment of the beneficial\ninterests issued by the securitization trusts; they are not available to pay the Firm’s other obligations or the\nclaims of the Firm’s creditors. The agreements with the credit card securitization trusts require the Firm to\nmaintain a minimum undivided interest in the credit card trusts (generally 5%). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019,\nthe Firm held undivided interests in Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trusts of $ 5.4billion and $\n5.3billion, respectively. The Firm maintained an average undivided interest in principal receivables owned by those\ntrusts of approximately 39% and 50% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    253\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n2019. The Firm did not retain any senior securities and retained $ 1.5billion and $ 3.0billion of subordinated\nsecurities in certain of its credit card securitization trusts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The\nFirm’s undivided interests in the credit card trusts and securities retained are eliminated in consolidation. Firm-\nsponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and\npurchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB\nbusinesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act\nas the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label\nsecuritization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or\nguarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value\nof these interests. Refer to Securitization activity on page 259 of this Note for further information regarding the\nFirm’s cash flows associated with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and pages 259-260 of this Note\nfor information on the Firm’s loan sales and securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies.\nJPMorgan\nChase\ninterest\nPrincip…                        Assets             in\namount                       held in       securit…\noutstan…                      noncons…         assets\nDecemb…          Total         Assets       securit…             in                                       Total\n31,             assets        held in           VIEs       noncons…                                     intere…\n2020           held by       consoli…           with       VIEs(c)…                         Other       held by\n(in           securit…       securit…       continu…        Trading       Investm…       financi…       JPMorg…\nmillio…           VIEs           VIEs       involve…         assets       securit…         assets         Chase\nSecuri…\nReside…\nmortga…\nPrime/…\nand        $    49,644    $     1,693    $    41,265    $       574    $       724    $         —    $    1,298\noption\nARMs\nSubpri…         12,896             46         12,154              9              —              —             9\nCommer…\nand            119,732              —         92,351            955          1,549            262         2,766\nother(…\nTotal      $   182,272    $     1,739    $   145,770    $     1,538    $     2,273    $       262    $    4,073\nJPMorgan\nChase\ninterest\nPrincip…                        Assets             in\namount                       held in       securit…\noutstan…                      noncons…         assets\nDecemb…          Total         Assets       securit…             in                                       Total\n31,             assets        held in           VIEs       noncons…                                     intere…\n2019           held by       consoli…           with       VIEs(c)…                         Other       held by\n(in           securit…       securit…       continu…        Trading       Investm…       financi…       JPMorg…\nmillio…           VIEs           VIEs       involve…         assets       securit…         assets         Chase\nSecuri…\nReside…\nmortga…\nPrime/…\nand        $    60,348    $     2,796    $    48,734    $       535    $       625    $         —    $    1,160\noption\nARMs\nSubpri…         14,661              —         13,490              7              —              —             7\nCommer…\nand            111,903              —         80,878            785            773            241         1,799\nother(…\nTotal      $   186,912    $     2,796    $   143,102    $     1,327    $     1,398    $       241    $    2,966\n(a) Excludes U.S. GSEs and government agency securitizations and re-securitizations, which are not Firm-sponsored.\nRefer to pages 259-260 of this Note for information on the Firm’s loan sales and securitization activity related to\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies.\n(b) Consists of securities backed by commercial real estate loans and non-mortgage-related consumer receivables\npurchased from third parties.\n(c) Excludes the following: retained servicing (refer to Note 15 for a discussion of MSRs); securities retained\nfrom loan sales and securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies; interest rate and foreign\nexchange derivatives primarily used to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risks of securitization entities\n(refer to Note 5 for further information on derivatives); senior and subordinated securities of $ 105million and $\n40million, respectively, at December 31, 2020, and $ 106million and $ 94million, respectively, at December 31,\n2019, which the Firm purchased in connection with CIB’s secondary market-making activities.\n(d) Includes interests held in re-securitization transactions.\n(e) As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 73% and 63%, respectively, of the Firm’s retained securitization interests,\nwhich are predominantly carried at fair value and include amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk\nretention rules, were risk-rated “A” or better, on an S&P-equivalent basis. The retained interests in prime\nresidential mortgages consisted of $ 1.3billion and $ 1.1billion of investment-grade retained interests, and $\n41million and $ 72million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe retained interests in commercial and other securitization trusts consisted of $ 2.0billion and $ 1.2billion of\ninvestment-grade retained interests, and $ 753million and $ 575million of noninvestment-grade retained interests at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n254    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nResidential mortgage The Firm securitizes residential\nmortgage loans originated by CCB, as well as\nresidential mortgage loans purchased from third\nparties by either CCB or CIB. CCB generally retains\nservicing for all residential mortgage loans it\noriginated or purchased, and for certain mortgage\nloans purchased by CIB. For securitizations of loans\nserviced by CCB, the Firm has the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the VIE because it is\nresponsible for decisions related to loan\nmodifications and workouts. CCB may also retain an\ninterest upon securitization. In addition, CIB engages\nin underwriting and trading activities involving\nsecurities issued by Firm-sponsored securitization\ntrusts. As a result, CIB at times retains senior\nand/or subordinated interests (including residual\ninterests and amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules) in residential mortgage\nsecuritizations at the time of securitization, and/or\nreacquires positions in the secondary market in the\nnormal course of business. In certain instances, as a\nresult of the positions retained or reacquired by CIB\nor held by Treasury and CIO or CCB, when considered\ntogether with the servicing arrangements entered into\nby CCB, the Firm is deemed to be the primary\nbeneficiary of certain securitization trusts. Refer to\nthe table on page 257 of this Note for more\ninformation on consolidated residential mortgage\nsecuritizations. The Firm does not consolidate\nresidential mortgage securitizations (Firm-sponsored\nor third-party-sponsored) when it is not the servicer\n(and therefore does not have the power to direct the\nmost significant activities of the trust) or does not\nhold a beneficial interest in the trust that could\npotentially be significant to the trust. Refer to the\ntable on page 257 of this Note for more information on\nthe consolidated residential mortgage securitizations,\nand the table on the previous page of this Note for\nfurther information on interests held in\nnonconsolidated residential mortgage securitizations.\nCommercial mortgages and other consumer\nsecuritizations CIB originates and securitizes\ncommercial mortgage loans, and engages in underwriting\nand trading activities involving the securities issued\nby securitization trusts. CIB may retain unsold senior\nand/or subordinated interests (including amounts\nrequired to be held pursuant to credit risk retention\nrules) in commercial mortgage securitizations at the\ntime of securitization but, generally, the Firm does\nnot service commercial loan securitizations. Treasury\nand CIO may choose to invest in these securitizations\nas well. For commercial mortgage securitizations the\npower to direct the significant activities of the VIE\ngenerally is held by the servicer or investors in a\nspecified class of securities (“controlling class”).\nThe Firm generally does not retain an interest in the\ncontrolling class in its sponsored commercial mortgage\nsecuritization transactions. Refer to the table on\npage 257 of this Note for more information on the\nconsolidated commercial mortgage securitizations, and\nthe table on the previous page of this Note for\nfurther\ninformation on interests held in nonconsolidated\nsecuritizations. Re-securitizations The Firm engages\nin certain re-securitization transactions in which\ndebt securities are transferred to a VIE in exchange\nfor new beneficial interests. These transfers occur in\nconnection with both U.S. GSEs and government agency\nsponsored VIEs, which are backed by residential\nmortgages. The Firm’s consolidation analysis is\nlargely dependent on the Firm’s role and interest in\nthe re-securitization trusts.\nThe following table presents the principal amount of securities transferred to re-securitization VIEs.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                             2020         2019         2018\nTransfers of securities to VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies    $  46,123    $  25,852    $  15,532\nMost re-securitizations with which the Firm is\ninvolved are client-driven transactions in which a\nspecific client or group of clients is seeking a\nspecific return or risk profile. For these\ntransactions, the Firm has concluded that the\ndecision-making power of the entity is shared between\nthe Firm and its clients, considering the joint effort\nand decisions in establishing the re-securitization\ntrust and its assets, as well as the significant\neconomic interest the client holds in the re-\nsecuritization trust; therefore the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE. The Firm did\nnot transfer any private label securities to re-\nsecuritization VIEs during 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively, and retained interests in any such Firm-\nsponsored VIEs as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 were\nimmaterial. Additionally, the Firm may invest in\nbeneficial interests of third-party-sponsored re-\nsecuritizations and generally purchases these\ninterests in the secondary market. In these\ncircumstances, the Firm does not have the unilateral\nability to direct the most significant activities of\nthe re-securitization trust, either because it was not\ninvolved in the initial design of the trust, or the\nFirm is involved with an independent third-party\nsponsor and demonstrates shared power over the\ncreation of the trust; therefore, the Firm does not\nconsolidate the re-securitization VIE.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    255\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents information on the Firm's interests in nonconsolidated re-securitization VIEs.\nDecember 31,                                   Nonconsolidated\n(in millions)                           re-securitization VIEs\nU.S. GSEs and government agencies                         2020        2019\nInterest in VIEs                     $                   2,631    $  2,928\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Firm did not\nconsolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-\nsecuritization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-\nlabel re-securitization VIEs. Multi-seller conduits\nMulti-seller conduit entities are separate bankruptcy\nremote entities that provide secured financing,\ncollateralized by pools of receivables and other\nfinancial assets, to customers of the Firm. The\nconduits fund their financing facilities through the\nissuance of highly rated commercial paper. The primary\nsource of repayment of the commercial paper is the\ncash flows from the pools of assets. In most\ninstances, the assets are structured with deal-\nspecific credit enhancements provided to the conduits\nby the customers (i.e., sellers) or other third\nparties. Deal-specific credit enhancements are\ngenerally structured to cover a multiple of historical\nlosses expected on the pool of assets, and are\ntypically in the form of overcollateralization\nprovided by the seller. The deal-specific credit\nenhancements mitigate the Firm’s potential losses on\nits agreements with the conduits. To ensure timely\nrepayment of the commercial paper, and to provide the\nconduits with funding to provide financing to\ncustomers in the event that the conduits do not obtain\nfunding in the commercial paper market, each asset\npool financed by the conduits has a minimum 100% deal-\nspecific liquidity facility associated with it\nprovided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. also provides the multi-seller conduit\nvehicles with uncommitted program-wide liquidity\nfacilities and program-wide credit enhancement in the\nform of standby letters of credit. The amount of\nprogram-wide credit enhancement required is based upon\ncommercial paper issuance and approximates 10% of the\noutstanding balance of commercial paper. The Firm\nconsolidates its Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits, as the Firm has both the power to direct the\nsignificant activities of the conduits and a\npotentially significant economic interest in the\nconduits. As administrative agent and in its role in\nstructuring transactions, the Firm makes decisions\nregarding asset types and credit quality, and manages\nthe commercial paper funding needs of the conduits.\nThe Firm’s interests that could potentially be\nsignificant to the VIEs include the fees received as\nadministrative agent and liquidity and program-wide\ncredit enhancement provider, as well as the potential\nexposure created by the liquidity and credit\nenhancement facilities provided to the conduits. Refer\nto page 257 of this Note for further information on\nconsolidated VIE assets and liabilities.\nIn the normal course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes\nmarkets in and invests in commercial paper issued by\nthe Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm\nheld $ 13.5billion and $ 16.3billion of the commercial\npaper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively,\nwhich have been eliminated in consolidation. The\nFirm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs\nand capacity and were not driven by market\nilliquidity. Other than the amounts required to be\nheld pursuant to credit risk retention rules, the Firm\nis not obligated under any agreement to purchase the\ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity\nfacilities, program-wide liquidity and credit\nenhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated\nin consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits provide lending-related\ncommitments to certain clients of the Firm-\nadministered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded\ncommitments were $ 12.2billion and $ 8.9billion at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are\nreported as off-balance sheet lending-related\ncommitments in other unfunded commitments to extend\ncredit. Refer to Note 28 for more information on off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal\nbond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option\nbond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance\ntheir municipal bond investments at short-term rates.\nIn a typical TOB transaction, the trust purchases\nhighly rated municipal bond(s) of a single issuer and\nfunds the purchase by issuing two types of securities:\n(1) puttable floating-rate certificates (“floaters”)\nand (2) inverse floating-rate residual interests\n(“residuals”). The floaters are typically purchased by\nmoney market funds or other short-term investors and\nmay be tendered, with requisite notice, to the TOB\ntrust. The residuals are retained by the investor\nseeking to finance its municipal bond investment. TOB\ntransactions where the residual is held by a third-\nparty investor are typically known as customer TOB\ntrusts, and non-customer TOB trusts are transactions\nwhere the Residual is retained by the Firm. Customer\nTOB trusts are sponsored by a third party; refer to\npage 258 of this Note for further information. The\nFirm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB\ntransactions. The Firm may provide various services to\na TOB trust, including remarketing agent, liquidity or\ntender option provider, and/or sponsor. J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC may serve as a remarketing agent on the\nfloaters for TOB trusts. The remarketing agent is\nresponsible for establishing the periodic variable\nrate on the floaters, conducting the initial placement\nand remarketing tendered floaters. The remarketing\nagent may, but is not obligated to, make markets in\nfloaters. Floaters held by the Firm were not material\nduring 2020 and 2019. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC often serves as the sole\nliquidity or tender option provider for the TOB\ntrusts. The liquidity provider’s obligation to\n256    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nperform is conditional and is limited by certain events (“Termination Events”), which include bankruptcy or failure\nto pay by the municipal bond issuer or credit enhancement provider, an event of taxability on the municipal bonds\nor the immediate downgrade of the municipal bond to below investment grade. In addition, the liquidity provider’s\nexposure is typically further limited by the high credit quality of the underlying municipal bonds, the excess\ncollateralization in the vehicle, or, in certain transactions, the reimbursement agreements with the Residual\nholders. Holders of the floaters may “put,” or tender, their floaters to the TOB trust. If the remarketing agent\ncannot successfully remarket the floaters to another investor, the liquidity provider either provides a loan to the\nTOB trust for the TOB trust’s purchase of the floaters, or it directly purchases the tendered floaters. TOB trusts\nare considered to be variable interest entities. The Firm consolidates non-customer TOB trusts because as the\nResidual holder, the Firm has the right to make decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the\nmunicipal bond vehicle, and it has the right to receive benefits and bear losses that could potentially be\nsignificant to the municipal bond vehicle.\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019.\nLiabilit…\nDecemb…                                                                 Benefici…\n31,                                                                     interests\n2020            Assets                                                         in\n(in            Trading                                      Total             VIE                         Total\nmillio…         assets        Loans       Other(b)       assets(…       assets(d)       Other(e)       liabili…\nVIE\nprogram\ntype\nFirm-s…\ncredit     $         —    $  11,962    $       148    $    12,110    $      4,943    $         3    $     4,946\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-a…\nmulti-…              2       23,787            188         23,977          10,523             33         10,556\ncondui…\nMunici…\nbond             1,930            —              2          1,932           1,902              —          1,902\nvehicl…\nMortga…\nsecuri…              —        1,694             94          1,788             210            108            318\nentiti…\nOther                2          176            249            427               —             89             89\nTotal      $     1,934    $  37,619    $       681    $    40,234    $     17,578    $       233    $    17,811\nAssets                                                  Liabilit…\nDecemb…                                                                 Benefici…\n31,            Trading                                      Total       interests                         Total\n2019            assets        Loans       Other(b)       assets(…              in       Other(e)       liabili…\n(in                                                                           VIE\nmillio…                                                                 assets(d)\nVIE\nprogram\ntype\nFirm-s…\ncredit     $         —    $  14,986    $       266    $    15,252    $      6,461    $         6    $     6,467\ncard\ntrusts\nFirm-a…\nmulti-…              1       25,183            355         25,539           9,223             36          9,259\ncondui…\nMunici…\nbond             1,903            —              4          1,907           1,881              3          1,884\nvehicl…\nMortga…\nsecuri…             66        2,762             64          2,892             276            130            406\nentiti…\nOther              663            —            192            855               —            272            272\nTotal      $     2,633    $  42,931    $       881    $    46,445    $     17,841    $       447    $    18,288\n(a) Includes residential and commercial mortgage securitizations.\n(b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities.

Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.2billion\nand $ 6.7billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Refer to Note 20 for additional information on\ninterest-bearing long-term beneficial interests.\n(e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    257\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement\nagent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual\ncredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,\nthe Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects.\nThese entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing member and\nhas control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not\nconsolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a\nreturn primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure,\nrepresented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 24.9billion and $ 19.1billion, of which $\n8.7billion and $ 5.5billion was unfunded at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In order to reduce the risk\nof loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds varying amounts of its capital investment until the project\nqualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Refer to\nNote 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Customer municipal bond vehicles\n(TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts, including remarketing agent, liquidity\nor tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into\na reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions, upon the termination of the vehicle, the\nFirm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not have any intent to\nprotect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying municipal bonds. The Firm does not\nconsolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make decisions that significantly impact\nthe economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to\ncustomer TOB trusts at December 31, 2020 and 2019, was $ 6.7billion and $ 5.5billion, respectively. The fair value\nof assets held by such VIEs at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 10.5billion and $ 8.6billion, respectively. Refer\nto Note 28 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Loan securitizations The Firm has\nsecuritized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage. The\npurposes of these securitization transactions were to satisfy investor demand and to generate liquidity for the\nFirm. For loan securitizations in which the Firm is not required to consolidate the trust, the Firm records the\ntransfer of the loan receivable to the trust as a sale when all of the following accounting criteria for a sale are\nmet: (1) the transferred financial assets are legally isolated from the Firm’s creditors; (2) the transferee or\nbeneficial interest holder can pledge or exchange the transferred financial assets; and (3) the Firm does not\nmaintain effective control over the transferred financial assets (e.g., the Firm cannot repurchase the transferred\nassets before their maturity and it does not have the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return the\ntransferred assets). For loan securitizations accounted for as a sale, the Firm recognizes a gain or loss based on\nthe difference between the value of proceeds received (including cash, beneficial interests, or servicing assets\nreceived) and the carrying value of the assets sold. Gains and losses on securitizations are reported in\nnoninterest revenue.\n258    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not\nconsolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\nYear\nended\nDecember\n31,                   2020       Commercial             2019       Commercial             2018       Commercial\n(in             Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and       Residenti…              and\nmillions)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)       mortgage(…         other(e)\nPrincipal    $       7,103    $       6,624    $       9,957    $       9,390    $       6,431    $      10,159\nsecuriti…\nAll cash\nflows\nduring\nthe\nperiod:(…\nProceeds\nreceived\nfrom loan    $       7,321    $       6,865    $      10,238    $       9,544    $       6,449    $      10,218\nsales as\nfinancial\ninstrume…\nServicing\nfees                   211                1              287                2              319                2\ncollected\nCash\nflows\nreceived               801              239              507              237              411              301\non\ninterests\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Predominantly includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for\nthe purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement\nof the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these\nloans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the\nsecuritization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of\nloan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the\npurchaser.

For 2019, represents goodwill associated with the\nacquisition of InstaMed. This goodwill was allocated\nto CIB, CB and CCB.\n(b) Primarily relates to foreign currency adjustments.\nGoodwill impairment testing The Firm’s goodwill was\nnot impaired at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted new\naccounting guidance related to goodwill impairment\ntesting. The adoption of the guidance requires\nrecognition of an impairment loss when the estimated\nfair value of a reporting unit falls below its\ncarrying value. It eliminated the requirement that an\nimpairment loss be recognized only if the estimated\nimplied fair value of the goodwill is below its\ncarrying value. The goodwill impairment test is\nperformed by comparing the current fair value of each\nreporting unit with its\ncarrying value. If the fair value is in excess of the\ncarrying value, then the reporting unit’s goodwill is\nconsidered not to be impaired. If the fair value is\nless than the carrying value, then an impairment\ncharge is recognized for the amount by which the\nreporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair\nvalue, up to the amount of goodwill allocated to that\nreporting unit. The Firm uses the reporting units’\nallocated capital plus goodwill and other intangible\nassets as a proxy for the carrying values of equity\nfor the reporting units in the goodwill impairment\ntesting. Reporting unit equity is determined on a\nsimilar basis as the allocation of capital to the LOBs\nwhich takes into consideration a variety of factors\nincluding capital levels of similarly rated peers and\napplicable regulatory capital requirements. Proposed\nLOB capital levels are incorporated into the Firm’s\nannual budget process, which is reviewed by the Firm’s\nBoard of Directors. Allocated capital is further\nreviewed periodically and updated as needed. The\nprimary method the Firm uses to estimate the fair\nvalue of its reporting units is the income approach.\nThis approach projects cash flows for the forecast\nperiod and uses the perpetuity growth method to\ncalculate terminal values. These cash flows and\nterminal values are then discounted using an\nappropriate discount rate. Projections of cash flows\nare based on the reporting units’ earnings forecasts\nwhich are reviewed with senior management of the Firm.\nThe discount rate used for each reporting unit\nrepresents an estimate of the cost of equity for that\nreporting unit and is determined considering the\nFirm’s overall estimated cost of equity (estimated\nusing the Capital Asset Pricing Model), as adjusted\nfor the risk characteristics specific to each\nreporting unit (for example, for higher levels of risk\nor uncertainty associated with the business or\nmanagement’s forecasts and assumptions). To assess the\nreasonableness of the discount rates used for each\nreporting unit, management compares the discount rate\nto the estimated cost of equity for publicly traded\ninstitutions with similar businesses and risk\ncharacteristics. In addition, the weighted average\ncost of equity (aggregating the various reporting\nunits) is compared with the Firm’s overall estimated\ncost of equity to ensure reasonableness. The\nvaluations derived from the discounted cash flow\nanalysis are then compared with market-based trading\nand transaction multiples for relevant competitors.\nTrading and transaction comparables are used as\ngeneral indicators to assess the overall\nreasonableness of the estimated fair values, although\nprecise conclusions generally cannot be drawn due to\nthe differences that naturally exist between the\nFirm’s businesses and competitor institutions.\nManagement also takes into consideration a comparison\nbetween the aggregate fair values of the Firm’s\nreporting units and JPMorgan Chase’s market\ncapitalization. In evaluating this comparison,\nmanagement considers several factors, including (i) a\ncontrol premium that would exist in a market\ntransaction, (ii) factors related to the level of\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    261\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nexecution risk that would exist at the Firmwide level that do not exist at the reporting unit level and (iii)\nshort-term market volatility and other factors that do not directly affect the value of individual reporting units.\nUnanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital requirements, as\nwell as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases in\nthe estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting units to decline\nin the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period related to some\nportion of the associated goodwill. Mortgage servicing rights MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash\nflows for performing servicing activities for others. The fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and\nancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service the loans, and generally declines over time as net\nservicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary\nfee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage\nloans if servicing is retained. As permitted by U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to account for its MSRs at fair\nvalue. The Firm treats its MSRs as a single class of servicing assets based on the availability of market inputs\nused to measure the fair value of its MSR asset and its treatment of MSRs as one aggregate pool for risk management\npurposes. The Firm estimates the fair value of MSRs using an option-adjusted spread (“OAS”) model, which projects\nMSR cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios in conjunction with the Firm’s prepayment model, and then\ndiscounts these cash flows at risk-adjusted rates. The model considers portfolio characteristics, contractually\nspecified servicing fees, prepayment assumptions, delinquency rates, costs to service, late charges and other\nancillary revenue, and other economic factors. The Firm compares fair value estimates and assumptions to observable\nmarket data where available, and also considers recent market activity and actual portfolio experience.\n262    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nThe fair value of MSRs is sensitive to changes in interest rates, including their effect on prepayment speeds. MSRs\ntypically decrease in value when interest rates decline because declining interest rates tend to increase\nprepayments and therefore reduce the expected life of the net servicing cash flows that comprise the MSR asset.\nConversely, securities (e.g., mortgage-backed securities), and certain derivatives (e.g., those for which the Firm\nreceives fixed-rate interest payments) increase in value when interest rates decline. JPMorgan Chase uses\ncombinations of derivatives and securities to manage the risk of changes in the fair value of MSRs. The intent is\nto offset any interest-rate related changes in the fair value of MSRs with changes in the fair value of the related\nrisk management instruments.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nAs of or for the year ended December 31,\n(in millions, except where otherwise\nnoted)                                                 2020               2019                    2018\nFair value at beginning of period           $   4,699          $   6,130                $  6,030\nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs                              944              1,384                     931\nPurchase of MSRs                                  248                105                     315\nDisposition of MSRs(a)                           -176               -789                    -636\nNet additions/(Dispositions)                    1,016                700                     610\nChanges due to collection/realization of         -899               -951                    -740\nexpected cash flows\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and\nassumptions:\nChanges due to market interest rates and       -1,568               -893                     300\nother(b)\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs\nand assumptions:\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to               -54               -333          -e          15\nservice)\nDiscount rates                                    199                153                      24\nPrepayment model changes and other(c)            -117               -107                    -109\nTotal changes in valuation due to other            28               -287                     -70\ninputs and assumptions\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs       -1,540             -1,180                     230\nand assumptions\nFair value at December 31,                  $   3,276          $   4,699                $  6,130\nChange in unrealized gains/(losses)\nincluded in income related to MSRs held     $  -1,540          $  -1,180                $    230\nat December 31,\nContractual service fees, late fees and         1,325              1,639                   1,778\nother ancillary fees included in income\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at          448.0              522.0                   521.0\nDecember 31, (in billions)\nServicer advances, net of an allowance\nfor uncollectible amounts, at December            1.8                2.0                     3.0\n31, (in billions)(d)\n(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities\n(“SMBS”).

In addition, the Firm\nmaintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,\ncertain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules\nand agreements.\n(e) The decrease in projected cash flows was largely related to default servicing assumption updates.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    263\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nThe following table presents the components of mortgage fees and related income (including the impact of MSR risk\nmanagement activities) for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                         2020              2019              2018\nCCB mortgage fees and related income\nNet production revenue                     $   2,629          $  1,618          $    268\nNet mortgage servicing revenue:\nOperating revenue:\nLoan servicing revenue                         1,367             1,533             1,835\nChanges in MSR asset fair value due to\ncollection/realization of expected cash         -899              -951              -740\nflows\nTotal operating revenue                          468               582             1,095\nRisk management:\nChanges in MSR asset fair value due to        -1,568              -893               300\nmarket interest rates and other(a)\nOther changes in MSR asset fair value\ndue to other inputs and assumptions in            28              -287               -70\nmodel(b)\nChange in derivative fair value and            1,522             1,015              -341\nother\nTotal risk management                            -18              -165              -111\nTotal net mortgage servicing revenue             450               417               984\nTotal CCB mortgage fees and related            3,079             2,035             1,252\nincome\nAll other                                         12                 1                 2\nMortgage fees and related income           $   3,091          $  2,036          $  1,254\n(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,\nand the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g.,\ncost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market\ninterest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).\nThe table below outlines the key economic assumptions used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2019, and outlines the sensitivities of those fair values to immediate adverse changes in\nthose assumptions, as defined below.\nDecember 31,\n(in millions, except rates)                                                          2020              2019\nWeighted-average prepayment speed assumption (constant prepayment rate)       14.90  %          11.67  %\nImpact on fair value of 10% adverse                                        $   -206          $   -200\nchange\nImpact on fair value of 20% adverse                                            -392              -384\nchange\nWeighted-average option adjusted                                               7.19  %           7.93  %\nspread(a)\nImpact on fair value of 100 basis points                                   $   -134          $   -169\nadverse change\nImpact on fair value of 200 basis points                                       -258              -326\nadverse change\n(a) Includes the impact of operational risk and regulatory capital.\nChanges in fair value based on variations in\nassumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated,\nbecause the relationship of the change in the\nassumptions to the change in fair value are often\nhighly interrelated and may not be linear.

These leases generally have terms of 20years or less, determined based on the contractual\nmaturity of the lease, and include periods covered by options to extend or terminate the lease when the Firm is\nreasonably certain that it will exercise those options. All leases with lease terms greater than twelve months are\nreported as a lease liability with a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset. None of these lease agreements\nimpose restrictions on the Firm’s ability to pay dividends, engage in debt or equity financing transactions or\nenter into further lease agreements. Certain of these leases contain escalation clauses that will increase rental\npayments based on maintenance, utility and tax increases, which are non-lease components. The Firm elected not to\nseparate lease and non-lease components of a contract for its real estate leases. As such, real estate lease\npayments represent payments on both lease and non-lease components. Operating lease liabilities and ROU assets are\nrecognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the\nlease term.

Under the two-class method, all\nearnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated\nto common stock and participating securities. JPMorgan\nChase grants RSUs under its share-based compensation\nprograms, predominantly all of which entitle\nrecipients to receive nonforfeitable dividends during\nthe vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends\npaid to holders of the Firm’s common stock.

JPMorgan\nChase uses the asset and liability method to provide\nincome taxes on all transactions recorded in the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. This method\nrequires that income taxes reflect the expected future\ntax consequences of temporary differences between the\ncarrying amounts of assets or liabilities for book and\ntax purposes. Accordingly, a deferred tax asset or\nliability for each temporary difference is determined\nbased on the tax rates that the Firm expects to be in\neffect when the underlying items of income and expense\nare realized. JPMorgan Chase’s expense for income\ntaxes includes the current and deferred portions of\nthat expense. A valuation allowance is established to\nreduce deferred tax assets to the amount the Firm\nexpects to realize. Due to the inherent complexities\narising from the nature of the Firm’s businesses, and\nfrom conducting business and being taxed in a\nsubstantial number of jurisdictions, significant\njudgments and estimates are required to be made.\nAgreement of tax liabilities between JPMorgan Chase\nand the many tax jurisdictions in which the Firm files\ntax returns may not be finalized for several years.\nThus, the Firm’s final tax-related assets and\nliabilities may ultimately be different from those\ncurrently reported.\nEffective tax rate and expense\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the\napplicable statutory U.S. federal income tax rate to\nthe effective tax rate.\nEffective tax rate\nYear ended December 31,                   2020       2019       2018\nStatutory U.S. federal tax rate           21.0  %    21.0  %    21.0  %\nIncrease/(decrease) in tax rate\nresulting from:\nU.S. state and local income taxes, net     2.5        3.5        4.0\nof U.S. federal income tax benefit\nTax-exempt income                         -1.6       -1.4       -1.5\nNon-U.S. earnings                          1.4        1.8        0.6\nBusiness tax credits                      -6.3       -4.4       -3.5\nTax audit resolutions                        —       -2.3       -0.1\nImpact of the TCJA(a)                        —          —       -0.7\nOther, net                                 0.7          —        0.5\nEffective tax rate                        17.7  %    18.2  %    20.3  %\n(a) Represents changes in the estimates related to the\nremeasurement of certain deferred taxes and the deemed\nrepatriation tax on non-U.S. earnings under SEC Staff\nAccounting Bulletin No. 118 which was completed in\n2018.\nThe following table reflects the components of income\ntax expense/(benefit) included in the Consolidated\nstatements of income.\nIncome tax expense/(benefit)\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                       2020              2019              2018\nCurrent income tax expense/(benefit)\nU.S. federal                             $   5,759          $  3,284          $  2,854\nNon-U.S.                                     2,705             2,103             2,077\nU.S. state and local                         1,793             1,778             1,638\nTotal current income tax                    10,257             7,165             6,569\nexpense/(benefit)\nDeferred income tax expense/(benefit)\nU.S. federal                                -3,184               709             1,359\nNon-U.S.                                      -126                20               -93\nU.S. state and local                          -671               220               455\nTotal deferred income                       -3,981               949             1,721\ntaxexpense/(benefit)\nTotal income tax expense                 $   6,276          $  8,114          $  8,290\nTotal income tax expense includes $ 72million, $\n1.1billion and $ 54million of tax benefits recorded in\n2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively, resulting from the\nresolution of tax audits.\nTax effect of items recorded in stockholders’ equity\nThe preceding table does not reflect the tax effect of\ncertain items that are recorded each period directly\nin stockholders’ equity.

The significant\ncomponents of deferred tax assets and liabilities are\nreflected in the following table.\nDecember 31, (in millions)\nDeferred tax assets                                    2020               2019\nAllowance for loan losses                   $   7,270          $   3,400\nEmployee benefits                               1,104              1,039\nAccrued expenses and other                      3,332              2,767\nNon-U.S. operations                               849                949\nTax attribute carryforwards                       757                605\nGross deferred tax assets                      13,312              8,760\nValuation allowance                              -560               -557\nDeferred tax assets, net of valuation       $  12,752          $   8,203\nallowance\nDeferred tax liabilities\nDepreciation and amortization               $   3,329          $   2,852\nMortgage servicing rights, net of hedges        2,184              2,354\nLeasing transactions                            5,124              5,598\nOther, net                                      6,025              4,683\nGross deferred tax liabilities                 16,662             15,487\nNet deferred tax (liabilities)/assets       $  -3,910          $  -7,284\nJPMorgan Chase has recorded deferred tax assets of $\n757million at December 31, 2020, in connection with\nU.S. federal and non-U.S. NOL carryforwards, FTC\ncarryforwards, and state and local capital loss\ncarryforwards. At December 31, 2020, total U.S.\nfederal NOL carryforwards were $ 799million, non-U.S.\nNOL carryforwards were $ 139million, FTC carryforwards\nwere $ 444million, state and local capital loss\ncarryforwards were $ 1.1billion, and other federal tax\nattributes were $ 393million. If not utilized, a\nportion of the U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and\nother U.S. federal tax attributes will expire between\n2022 and 2037 whereas others have an unlimited\ncarryforward period.\nSimilarly, certain non-U.S. NOL carryforwards will\nexpire between 2026 and 2036 whereas others have an\nunlimited carryforward period. The FTC carryforwards\nwill expire between 2029 and 2030, and the state and\nlocal capital loss carryforwards will expire between\n2021 and 2022. The valuation allowance at December 31,\n2020, was due to the state and local capital loss\ncarryforwards, FTC carryforwards, and certain non-U.S.\ndeferred tax assets, including NOL carryforwards.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nAt December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, JPMorgan Chase’s\nunrecognized tax benefits, excluding related interest\nexpense and penalties, were $ 4.3billion, $ 4.0billion\nand $ 4.9billion, respectively, of which $ 3.1billion,\n$ 2.8billion and $ 3.8billion, respectively, if\nrecognized, would reduce the annual effective tax\nrate. Included in the amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits are certain items that would not affect the\neffective tax rate if they were recognized in the\nConsolidated statements of income. These unrecognized\nitems include the tax effect of certain temporary\ndifferences, the portion of gross state and local\nunrecognized tax benefits that would be offset by the\nbenefit from associated U.S. federal income tax\ndeductions, and the portion of gross non-U.S.\nunrecognized tax benefits that would have offsets in\nother jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase is presently under\naudit by a number of taxing authorities, most notably\nby the Internal Revenue Service as summarized in the\nTax examination status table below. As JPMorgan Chase\nis presently under audit by a number of taxing\nauthorities, it is reasonably possible that over the\nnext 12 months the resolution of these examinations\nmay increase or decrease the gross balance of\nunrecognized tax benefits by as much as approximately\n$ 300million. Upon settlement of an audit, the change\nin the unrecognized tax benefit would result from\npayment or income statement recognition.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the\nbeginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax\nbenefits.\nYear ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                         2020               2019               2018\nBalance at January 1,                       $  4,024          $   4,861          $   4,747\nIncreases based on tax positions related         685                871                980\nto the current period\nIncreases based on tax positions related         362                 10                649\nto prior periods\nDecreases based on tax positions related        -705               -706             -1,249\nto prior periods\nDecreases related to cash settlements           -116             -1,012               -266\nwith taxing authorities\nBalance at December 31,                     $  4,250          $   4,024          $   4,861\nAfter-tax interest expense/(benefit) and penalties\nrelated to income tax liabilities recognized in income\ntax expense were $ 147million, $( 52) million and $\n192million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2020 and 2019, in addition to the\nliability for unrecognized tax benefits, the Firm had\naccrued $ 966million and $ 817million, respectively,\nfor income tax-related interest and penalties.\n278    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nTax examination status\nJPMorgan Chase is continually under examination by the\nInternal Revenue Service, by taxing authorities\nthroughout the world, and by many state and local\njurisdictions throughout the U.S. The following table\nsummarizes the status of significant income tax\nexaminations of JPMorgan Chase and its consolidated\nsubsidiaries as of December 31, 2020.\nPeriods under examination    Status\nJPMorgan Chase – U.S.              2009 – 2013                  Field examination of amended returns\nJPMorgan Chase – U.S.              2014 - 2016                  Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase – New York State    2012 - 2014                  Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase – New York City     2012 - 2014                  Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase – California        2011 – 2012                  Field Examination\nJPMorgan Chase – U.K.              2006 – 2018                  Field examination of certain select entities\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    279\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 26 – Restricted cash, other restricted\nassets and intercompany funds transfers\nRestricted cash and other restricted assets\nCertain of the Firm’s cash and other assets are\nrestricted as to withdrawal or usage. These\nrestrictions are imposed by various regulatory\nauthorities based on the particular activities of the\nFirm’s subsidiaries.\nThe business of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is subject\nto examination and regulation by the OCC. The Bank is\na member of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, and its\ndeposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, subject\nto applicable limits.\nThe Firm is required to maintain cash reserves at\ncertain non-US central banks.\nThe Firm is also subject to rules and regulations\nestablished by other U.S. and non U.S. regulators. As\npart of its compliance with the respective regulatory\nrequirements, the Firm’s broker-dealers (principally\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC in the U.S and J.P. Morgan\nSecurities plc in the U.K.) are subject to certain\nrestrictions on cash and other assets.\nThe following table presents the components of the\nFirm’s restricted cash:\nDecember 31, (in billions)                     2020       2019\nCash reserves – Federal Reserve Banks(a)    $     —    $  26.6\nSegregated for the benefit of securities       19.3       16.0\nand cleared derivative customers\nCash reserves at non-U.S. central banks         5.1        3.9\nand held for other general purposes\nTotal restricted cash(b)                    $  24.4    $  46.5\n(a) Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve\neliminated reserve requirements for depository\ninstitutions\n(b) Comprises $ 22.7billion and $ 45.3billion in\ndeposits with banks, and $ 1.7billion and $ 1.2billion\nin cash and due from banks on the Consolidated balance\nsheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAlso, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Firm had the following other restricted assets:\nCash and securities pledged with clearing organizations for the benefit of customers of $ 37.2billion and $\n24.7billion, respectively.\nSecurities with a fair value of $ 1.3billion and $ 8.8billion, respectively, were also restricted in relation to\ncustomer activity.\nIntercompany funds transfers Restrictions imposed by U.S. federal law prohibit JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“Parent\nCompany”) and certain of its affiliates from borrowing from banking subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in\nspecified amounts. Such secured loans provided by any banking subsidiary to the Parent Company or to any particular\naffiliate, together with certain other transactions with such affiliate (collectively referred to as “covered\ntransactions”), are generally limited to 10% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital, as determined by the risk-\nbased capital guidelines; the aggregate amount of covered transactions between any banking subsidiary and all of\nits affiliates is limited to 20% of the banking subsidiary’s total capital. The Parent Company’s two principal\nsubsidiaries are JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Holdings LLC, an intermediate holding company (the\n“IHC”). The IHC holds the stock of substantially all of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries other than JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and its subsidiaries. The IHC also owns other assets and owes intercompany indebtedness to the holding\ncompany. The Parent Company is obligated to contribute to the IHC substantially all the net proceeds received from\nsecurities issuances (including issuances of senior and subordinated debt securities and of preferred and common\nstock). The principal sources of income and funding for the Parent Company are dividends from JPMorgan Chase Bank,\nN.A. and dividends and extensions of credit from the IHC. In addition to dividend restrictions set forth in\nstatutes and regulations, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have authority under the Financial Institutions\nSupervisory Act to prohibit or to limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise,\nincluding the Parent Company and its subsidiaries that are banks or bank holding companies, if, in the banking\nregulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial\ncondition of the banking organization. The IHC is prohibited from paying dividends or extending credit to the\nParent Company if certain capital or liquidity “thresholds” are breached or if limits are otherwise imposed by the\nParent Company’s management or Board of Directors. At January 1, 2021, the Parent Company’s banking subsidiaries\ncould pay, in the aggregate, approximately $ 13billion in dividends to their respective bank holding companies\nwithout the prior approval of their relevant banking regulators. The capacity to pay dividends in 2021 will be\nsupplemented by the banking subsidiaries’ earnings during the year.\n280    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNote 27 – Regulatory capital\nThe Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,\nincluding well-capitalized standards, for the\nconsolidated financial holding company. The OCC\nestablishes similar minimum capital requirements and\nstandards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The capital rules under\nBasel III establish minimum capital ratios and overall\ncapital adequacy standards for large and\ninternationally active U.S. bank holding companies and\nbanks, including the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and\nan advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each\nof the risk-based capital ratios, the capital adequacy\nof the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated\nagainst the lower of the Standardized or Advanced\napproaches compared to their respective minimum\ncapital ratios. The three components of regulatory\ncapital under the Basel III rules are as illustrated\nbelow: Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based\nguidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is\nrequired to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,\nTier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the\nSLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could\ncause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI\nsubsidiaries are also subject to these capital\nrequirements established by their respective primary\nregulators .\nThe following table presents the minimum and well-capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries\nwere subject as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nStandardiz…                           Advanced\ncapital                            Minimum                       Well-capit…\nratios                            capital                            ratios\nratios\nBHC(a)(b)(…        IDI(c)(d)         BHC(a)(c)       IDI(c)(d)            BHC(e)        IDI(f)\nCapital\nratios\nCET1                 11.3  %           7.0  %           10.5  %          7.0  %                 NA       6.5  %\ncapital\nTier 1               12.8              8.5              12.0             8.5               6.0           8.0\ncapital\nTotal                14.8             10.5              14.0            10.5              10.0          10.0\ncapital\nTier 1                4.0              4.0               4.0             4.0                    NA       5.0\nleverage\nSLR                        NA               NA           5.0             6.0                    NA       6.0\nNote: The table above is as defined by the regulations issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to which the\nFirm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.\n(a) Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable to the Firm.

The countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by the federal banking agencies.\n(b) For the period ended December 31, 2019, the CET1, Tier 1, Total, Tier 1 leverage and SLR minimum capital ratios\nunder Basel III Standardized applicable to the Firm were 10.5%, 12.0%, 14.0%, 4.0%, and 5.0%, respectively.\n(c) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as well as supplementary leverage buffer requirements of 2.0% and\n3.0% for BHC and IDI, respectively.\n(d) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital minimum\ncapital ratios include a fixed capital conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the IDI\nsubsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.\n(e) Represents requirements for bank holding companies pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.\n(f) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC Improvement Act.\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses Effective January 1,\n2020, the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments –\nCredit Losses guidance under U.S. GAAP. As permitted\nunder the U.S. capital rules issued by the federal\nbanking agencies in 2019, the Firm initially elected\nto phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL\nadoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion\nto CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to\n2023. As part of their response to the impact of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal\nbanking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued\nas final on August 26, 2020) that provided the option\nto delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for\ntwo years, followed by a three-year transition period\n. The final rule provides a uniform approach for\nestimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy\nincurred loss model during the first two years of the\ntransition period (the “day 2” transition amount),\nwhereby the Firm may exclude from CET1 capital 25% of\nthe change in the\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    281\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nallowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at\nDecember 31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 capital, as well as the $ 2.7billion day 1 impact, will be phased\ninto CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital\ntransition provisions, and accordingly, for the year ended December 31, 2020, the capital metrics of the Firm\nexclude $ 5.7billion , which is the $ 2.7billion day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $ 12.2billion\nincrease in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans). The impacts of the CECL capital\ntransition provisions have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total leverage\nexposure. Refer to Note 1 for further information on the CECL accounting guidance.\nThe following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches.

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and\nFDIC issued an interim final rule that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary exclusion\nsubject to certain restrictions. As of December 31, 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has not elected to apply this\nexclusion .\n(c) As of December 31, 2020, the capital metrics for the Firm reflect the exclusion of assets purchased from money\nmarket mutual fund clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF. Additionally, loans originated\nunder the PPP for the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. receive a zero percent risk weight.\n282    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNote 28 – Off–balance sheet lending-related\nfinancial instruments, guarantees, and\nother commitments\nJPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the\nfinancing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be\nrequired to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total\ncontractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. To provide for expected credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-\nrelated commitments, an allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments is maintained.Refer to Note 13\nfor further information regarding the allowance for credit losses on lending-related commitments, including the\nimpact of the Firm’s adoption of CECL accounting guidance on January 1, 2020. The following table summarizes the\ncontractual amounts and carrying values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and\nother commitments at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The amounts in the table below for credit card and home equity\nlending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced,\nand does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.\nThe Firm can reduce or cancel credit card lines of credit by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as\npermitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is\n60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of\nthe underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    283\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nIn conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments\nfrom the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the\nmethodology applied in determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the\ncurrent presentation.

In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are\nshown gross of risk participations.\n(e) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions\nfrom trading assets to loans, which resulted in a corresponding reclassification of commitments from Other\nguarantees and commitments to Wholesale other unfunded commitments to extend credit. Prior-period amounts have been\nrevised to conform with the current presentation.\n(f) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending indemnification\nagreements was $ 264.3billion and $ 216.2billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral primarily consists of\ncash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies.\n(g) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under the sponsored\nmember repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain clearing\nhouses.\n(h) At December 31, 2020 and 2019, primarily includes letters of credit hedged by derivative transactions and\nmanaged on a market risk basis, and unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity investments.\n(i) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation .\n(j) For lending-related products, the carrying value represents the allowance for lending-related commitments and\nthe guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value\noption was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.\n284    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of\ncommitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper\nfacilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well\nas committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose\nfacilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nGuarantees U.S. GAAP requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability in an amount\nequal to the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. U.S. GAAP defines a guarantee as a\ncontract that contingently requires the guarantor to pay a guaranteed party based upon: (a) changes in an\nunderlying asset, liability or equity security of the guaranteed party; or (b) a third party’s failure to perform\nunder a specified agreement. The Firm considers the following off–balance sheet arrangements to be guarantees under\nU.S. GAAP: standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees, securities lending indemnifications, certain\nindemnification agreements included within third-party contractual arrangements, certain derivative contracts and\nthe guarantees under the sponsored member repo program. As required by U.S. GAAP, the Firm initially records\nguarantees at the inception date fair value of the non-contingent obligation assumed (e.g., the amount of\nconsideration received or the net present value of the premium receivable). For these obligations, the Firm records\nthis fair value amount in other liabilities with an offsetting entry recorded in cash (for premiums received), or\nother assets (for premiums receivable). Any premium receivable recorded in other assets is reduced as cash is\nreceived under the contract, and the fair value of the liability recorded at inception is amortized into income as\nlending and deposit-related fees over the life of the guarantee contract. The lending-related contingent obligation\nis recognized based on expected credit losses in addition to, and separate from, any non-contingent obligation.\nNon-lending-related contingent obligations are recognized when the liability becomes probable and reasonably\nestimable. These obligations are not recognized if the estimated amount is less than the carrying amount of any\nnon-contingent liability recognized at inception (adjusted for any amortization). Examples of non-lending-related\ncontingent obligations include indemnifications provided in sales agreements, where a portion of the sale proceeds\nis allocated to the guarantee, which adjusts the gain or loss that would otherwise result from the transaction. For\nthese indemnifications, the initial liability is amortized to income as the Firm’s risk is reduced (i.e., over time\nor when the indemnification expires). The contractual amount and carrying value of guarantees and indemnifications\nare included in the table on page 284. For additional information on the guarantees, see below. Standby letters of\ncredit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees are conditional\nlending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a third party under\ncertain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition financings, trade and\nsimilar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\n2020                                              2019\nStandby                                           Standby\nletters of                                        letters of\ncredit and                                        credit and\nDecember 31,    other                                             other                                   Other\n(in             financial                        Other letters    financial                             letters\nmillions)       guarantees                           of credit    guarantees                          of credit\nInvestment-…                     $  22,850    $          2,263                     $  26,880    $         2,137\nNoninvestme…                         8,132                 790                         7,362                824\nTotal\ncontractual                      $  30,982    $          3,053                     $  34,242    $         2,961\namount\nAllowance\nfor                              $      80    $             14                     $     216    $             4\nlending-rel…\ncommitments\nGuarantee                              363                   —                           402                  —\nliability\nTotal\ncarrying                         $     443    $             14                     $     618    $             4\nvalue\nCommitments\nwith                             $  17,238    $            498                     $  17,853    $           728\ncollateral\n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 12 for further information on\ninternal risk ratings.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    285\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nSecurities lending indemnifications Through the Firm’s\nsecurities lending program, counterparties’\nsecurities, via custodial and non-custodial\narrangements, may be lent to third parties. As part of\nthis program, the Firm provides an indemnification in\nthe lending agreements which protects the lender\nagainst the failure of the borrower to return the lent\nsecurities. To minimize its liability under these\nindemnification agreements, the Firm obtains cash or\nother highly liquid collateral with a market value\nexceeding 100% of the value of the securities on loan\nfrom the borrower. Collateral is marked to market\ndaily to help assure that collateralization is\nadequate. Additional collateral is called from the\nborrower if a shortfall exists, or collateral may be\nreleased to the borrower in the event of\novercollateralization. If a borrower defaults, the\nFirm would use the collateral held to purchase\nreplacement securities in the market or to credit the\nlending client or counterparty with the cash\nequivalent thereof. The cash collateral held by the\nFirm may be invested on behalf of the client in\nindemnified resale agreements, whereby the Firm\nindemnifies the client against the loss of principal\ninvested. To minimize its liability under these\nagreements, the Firm obtains collateral with a market\nvalue exceeding 100% of the principal invested.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm\ntransacts in certain derivative contracts that have\nthe characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.\nThese contracts include written put options that\nrequire the Firm to purchase assets upon exercise by\nthe option holder at a specified price by a specified\ndate in the future. The Firm may enter into written\nput option contracts in order to meet client needs, or\nfor other trading purposes. The terms of written put\noptions are typically five yearsor less. Derivatives\ndeemed to be guarantees also includes stable value\ncontracts, commonly referred to as “stable value\nproducts”, that require the Firm to make a payment of\nthe difference between the market value and the book\nvalue of a counterparty’s reference portfolio of\nassets in the event that market value is less than\nbook value and certain other conditions have been met.\nStable value products are transacted in order to allow\ninvestors to realize investment returns with less\nvolatility than an unprotected portfolio. These\ncontracts are typically longer-term or may have no\nstated maturity, but allow the Firm to elect to\nterminate the contract under certain conditions. The\nnotional value of derivatives guarantees generally\nrepresents the Firm’s maximum exposure. However,\nexposure to certain stable value products is\ncontractually limited to a substantially lower\npercentage of the notional amount. The fair value of\nderivative guarantees reflects the probability, in the\nFirm’s view, of whether the Firm will be required to\nperform under the contract. The Firm reduces exposures\nto these contracts by entering into offsetting\ntransactions, or by entering into contracts that hedge\nthe market risk related to the derivative guarantees.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives qualifying as guarantees as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.\n(in millions)                                      December 31, 2020               December 31, 2019\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees                   $  54,415                       $  53,089\nStable value contracts with                27,752                          28,877\ncontractually limited exposure\nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited        2,803                           2,967\nexposure\nFair value\nDerivative payables                           322                             159\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the\ncharacteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a\npurchaser and seller of credit protection in the\ncredit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a\nfurther discussion of credit derivatives. Unsettled\nsecurities financing agreements In the normal course\nof business, the Firm enters into resale and\nsecurities borrowed agreements. At settlement, these\ncommitments result in the Firm advancing cash to and\nreceiving securities collateral from the counterparty.\nThe Firm also enters into repurchase and securities\nloaned agreements. At settlement, these commitments\nresult in the Firm receiving cash from and providing\nsecurities collateral to the counterparty. Such\nagreements settle at a future date. These agreements\ngenerally do not meet the definition of a derivative,\nand therefore, are not recorded on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets until settlement date. These agreements\npredominantly have regular-way settlement terms. Refer\nto Note 11 for a further discussion of securities\nfinancing agreements. Loan sales- and securitization-\nrelated indemnifications Mortgage repurchase liability\nIn connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has\nmade representations and warranties that the loans\nsold meet certain requirements, and that may require\nthe Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify\nthe loan purchaser if such representations and\nwarranties are breached by the Firm. Private label\nsecuritizations The liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label securitizations\nis separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing\nits litigation reserves. Refer to Note 30 for\nadditional information regarding litigation. Loans\nsold with recourse The Firm provides servicing for\nmortgages and certain commercial lending products on\nboth a recourse and nonrecourse basis. In nonrecourse\nservicing, the principal credit risk to the Firm is\nthe cost of temporary servicing advances of funds\n(i.e., normal servicing advances). In recourse\nservicing, the servicer agrees to share credit risk\n286    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nwith the owner of the mortgage loans, such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or a private investor, insurer or\nguarantor. Losses on recourse servicing predominantly occur when foreclosure sales proceeds of the property\nunderlying a defaulted loan are less than the sum of the outstanding principal balance, plus accrued interest on\nthe loan and the cost of holding and disposing of the underlying property. The Firm’s securitizations are\npredominantly nonrecourse, thereby effectively transferring the risk of future credit losses to the purchaser of\nthe mortgage-backed securities issued by the trust. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the unpaid principal balance of\nloans sold with recourse totaled $ 889million and $ 944million, respectively. The carrying value of the related\nliability that the Firm has recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets,\nwhich is representative of the Firm’s view of the likelihood it will have to perform under its recourse\nobligations, was $ 23million and $ 27million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Other off-balance sheet\narrangements Indemnification agreements – general In connection with issuing securities to investors outside the\nU.S., the Firm may agree to pay additional amounts to the holders of the securities in the event that, due to a\nchange in tax law, certain types of withholding taxes are imposed on payments on the securities. The terms of the\nsecurities may also give the Firm the right to redeem the securities if such additional amounts are payable. The\nFirm may also enter into indemnification clauses in connection with the licensing of software to clients (“software\nlicensees”) or when it sells a business or assets to a third party (“third-party purchasers”), pursuant to which it\nindemnifies software licensees for claims of liability or damages that may occur subsequent to the licensing of the\nsoftware, or third-party purchasers for losses they may incur due to actions taken by the Firm prior to the sale of\nthe business or assets. It is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum exposure under these indemnification\narrangements, since this would require an assessment of future changes in tax law and future claims that may be\nmade against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a\nmerchant acquirer, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that\nresult in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will\n(through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the\ntransaction to the merchant. If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant\nServices will bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this\nrisk by withholding future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition,\nMerchant Services recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related\nto charge-backs. The carrying value of the valuation allowance was $ 12million and $ 11million at December 31, 2020\nand 2019, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, Merchant Services processed an\naggregate volume of $ 1,597.3billion, $ 1,511.5billion, and $ 1,366.1billion, respectively. Clearing Services –\nClient Credit Risk The Firm provides clearing services for clients by entering into securities purchases and sales\nand derivative contracts with CCPs, including ETDs such as futures and options, as well as OTC-cleared derivative\ncontracts. As a clearing member, the Firm stands behind the performance of its clients, collects cash and\nsecurities collateral (margin) as well as any settlement amounts due from or to clients, and remits them to the\nrelevant CCP or client in whole or part. There are two types of margin: variation margin is posted on a daily basis\nbased on the value of clients’ derivative contracts and initial margin is posted at inception of a derivative\ncontract, generally on the basis of the potential changes in the variation margin requirement for the contract. As\na clearing member, the Firm is exposed to the risk of nonperformance by its clients, but is not liable to clients\nfor the performance of the CCPs. Where possible, the Firm seeks to mitigate its risk to the client through the\ncollection of appropriate amounts of margin at inception and throughout the life of the transactions. The Firm can\nalso cease providing clearing services if clients do not adhere to their obligations under the clearing agreement.\nIn the event of nonperformance by a client, the Firm would close out the client’s positions and access available\nmargin. The CCP would utilize any margin it holds to make itself whole, with any remaining shortfalls required to\nbe paid by the Firm as a clearing member. The Firm reflects its exposure to nonperformance risk of the client\nthrough the recognition of margin receivables from clients and margin payables to CCPs; the clients’ underlying\nsecurities or derivative contracts are not reflected in the Firm’s Consolidated Financial Statements. It is\ndifficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible exposure through its role as a clearing member, as this would\nrequire an assessment of transactions that clients may execute in the future. However, based upon historical\nexperience, and the credit risk mitigants available to the Firm, management believes it is unlikely that the Firm\nwill have to make any material payments under these arrangements and the risk of loss is expected to be remote.\nRefer to Note 5 for information on the derivatives that the Firm executes for its own account and records in its\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    287\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nExchange & Clearing House Memberships The Firm is a member of several securities and derivative exchanges and\nclearing houses, both in the U.S. and other countries, and it provides clearing services to its clients. Membership\nin some of these organizations requires the Firm to pay a pro rata share of the losses incurred by the organization\nas a result of the default of another member. Such obligations vary with different organizations. These obligations\nmay be limited to the amount (or a multiple of the amount) of the Firm’s contribution to the guarantee fund\nmaintained by a clearing house or exchange as part of the resources available to cover any losses in the event of a\nmember default. Alternatively, these obligations may also include a pro rata share of the residual losses after\napplying the guarantee fund. Additionally, certain clearing houses require the Firm as a member to pay a pro rata\nshare of losses that may result from the clearing house’s investment of guarantee fund contributions and initial\nmargin, unrelated to and independent of the default of another member. Generally a payment would only be required\nshould such losses exceed the resources of the clearing house or exchange that are contractually required to absorb\nthe losses in the first instance. In certain cases, it is difficult to estimate the Firm’s maximum possible\nexposure under these membership agreements, since this would require an assessment of future claims that may be\nmade against the Firm that have not yet occurred. However, based on historical experience, management expects the\nrisk of loss to the Firm to be remote. Where the Firm’s maximum possible exposure can be estimated, the amount is\ndisclosed in the table on page 284, in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line. Sponsored\nmember repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase\nagreements through the Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf\nof clients that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt\nand full payment and performance of its sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s rules.\nThe Firm minimizes its liability under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the cash or\nhigh-quality securities collateral that the clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the Firm expects the\nrisk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into consideration the associated\ncollateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page 284. Refer to Note\n11 for additional information on credit risk mitigation practices on resale agreements and the types of collateral\npledged under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries In the normal course of business, the Parent\nCompany may provide counterparties with guarantees of certain of the trading and other obligations of its\nsubsidiaries on a contract-by-contract basis, as negotiated with the Firm’s counterparties. The obligations of the\nsubsidiaries are included on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets or are reflected as off-balance sheet\ncommitments; therefore, the Parent Company has not recognized a separate liability for these guarantees. The Firm\nbelieves that the occurrence of any event that would trigger payments by the Parent Company under these guarantees\nis remote. The Parent Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes of its subsidiaries,\nincluding JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned and consolidated finance subsidiary. All\nsecurities issued by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company and no other subsidiary\nof the parent company guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which rank on a parity with the Firm’s\nunsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the table on page 284 of this Note. Refer to Note 20\nfor additional information.\n288    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNote 29 – Pledged assets and collateral\nPledged assets The Firm pledges financial assets that\nit owns to maintain potential borrowing capacity at\ndiscount windows with Federal Reserve banks, various\nother central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm\npledges assets for other purposes, including to\ncollateralize repurchase and other securities\nfinancing agreements, to cover short sales and to\ncollateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nCertain of these pledged assets may be sold or\nrepledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and\nare parenthetically identified on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s pledged assets.\nDecember 31, (in billions)                      2020        2019\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or     $  166.6    $  125.2\notherwise used by secured parties\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged       113.9        80.2\nor otherwise used by secured parties\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks        455.3       478.9\nand FHLBs\nTotal pledged assets                        $  735.8    $  684.3\nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of\nconsolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities.

The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits\nwith potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both\ngovernmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of\nadjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several\ngeographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust,\nsecurities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the\nestimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal\nproceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.5billion at December 31, 2020. This estimated aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the\nFirm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not\nbelieve that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the\nproceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of\nmultiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous\nyet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of\nmany of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,\nincluding where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about\nthe behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be\nincorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into\naccount in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the\nFirm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual\nlosses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Advisory\nand Other Activities . In November 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into a resolution with the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) regarding historical deficiencies in internal controls and internal audit for\ncertain fiduciary activities. In connection with the resolution, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid a $ 250million\nCivil Money Penalty. The OCC found that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has remediated the deficiencies that led to the\npenalty. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in\nconnection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities\ninto residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed\ncivil claims against Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or\nfailure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India\nsince 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India\nissued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase\nentities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money\nlaundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money\nLaundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate\nissued a provisional attachment order as part of the criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $ 25million\nheld by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020, the funds were transferred to an account held by the Supreme\nCourt of India. A separate civil proceeding relating to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding\nto and cooperating with the investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\noperated an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international\noil companies. The account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over\nrights to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in\nthe account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal\nRepublic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments\nmade out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were\ninstructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nwas or should have been on\n290    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nnotice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was\nunsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in February 2022. Foreign Exchange\nInvestigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities\nrelating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities.\nAmong those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. In\nJanuary 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation ending in January\n2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout the probation\nperiod. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-yearexemption of disqualification that allows the Firm and\nits affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee\nRetirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course for a\nfurther exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-yeardisqualification period. A South Africa Competition\nCommission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South\nAfrica Competition Tribunal. In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York\ngranted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,\nwhich principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign\nexchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures.\nCertain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of\nthem filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number\nof these actions remain pending. Further, putative class actions have been filed against the Firm and a number of\nother foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly\ninflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments; these actions also remain pending in the\nDistrict Court. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by the Firm and 11other defendants of a class action filed\nby purported indirect purchasers for a total of $ 10million. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative\nclass actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K.,\nIsrael and Australia. Interchange Litigation. G roups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class\naction complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit\nand debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties\ninitially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications\nto certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the\ncase was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings\nconsistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking\nprimarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the\nclass action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement\nagreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the\napproximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended\nagreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and\nthose appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $\n700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement\nagreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately. In addition, certain\nmerchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against\nthe Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations\nand Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around\nthe world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for\nvarious currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss\nCompetition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other banks are subject,\ncontinues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with\nthe European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along\nwith other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to benchmarks, including U.S. dollar\nLIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate consolidated putative class action,\nduring the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration. These actions have been filed, or\nconsolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. In\nthese actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods, starting in 2000 or later, defendants\neither individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by submitting rates that were artificially\nlow or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives or other financial instruments whose\nvalues are affected by\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    291\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nchanges in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. In actions\nrelated to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has resolved certain\nof these actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The District Court dismissed certain claims,\nincluding antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert\nsuch claims, and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of\nthe Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of\nstanding have filed an appeal. The District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds\nand interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by other\nplaintiffs. In the consolidated putative class action related to the time period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was\nadministered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’\ncomplaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss\nfranc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (“SIBOR”), and the Australian\nBank Bill Swap Reference Rate, and one of the putative class actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to\ncourt approval. In the class actions related to SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that the\nCourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs’ appeals of those decisions are pending. In addition to\nthe actions pending or consolidated in the Southern District of New York, in August 2020, a group of individual\nplaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims in the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof California, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set LIBOR and\nconspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. The complaint seeks injunctive\nrelief and monetary damages. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The\nFirm previously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and\nExchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective investigations relating to\nhistorical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related\nconduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it\nagreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and\nagreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as\nset forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years,\nprovided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all\nof their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A\nportion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative class action\ncomplaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the\nFirm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in\nviolation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or\npractices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class\nactions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In addition, several putative\nclass actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and\nSouthern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and\nbringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions\nin the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court\nconsolidated these putative class actions in October 2020 and set a deadline of February 2021 for the filing of a\nconsolidated complaint. Twoputative class action complaints have also been filed under the Securities Exchange Act\nof 1934 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain\nindividual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that\ncertain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain\ninformation relating to the above-referenced investigations. Plaintiffs have filed a stipulation seeking\nconsolidation of the actions and the appointment of co-lead plaintiffs and counsel, which is pending Court\napproval. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions\nentered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to\nrestructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the\ntransactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the investigation. The\ninvestigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the\nFrench tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris Court of Appeal\nissued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of Cassation, France’s\nhighest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an\n292    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel . The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power to\ntake further action against JPMorgan Chase following the Court of Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of\nthe managers of Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify\nwhether a further investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase, pending which the trial was postponed. In\naddition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The claims\nare separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In addition to the\nvarious legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are\notherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious\ndefenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend\nitself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has\nestablished reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the\nprovisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable\nthat such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates\nits outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such\nreserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel.\nThe Firm’s legal expense was $ 1.1billion, $ 239million and $ 72million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019\nand 2018, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in\nthe future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where\nthe claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve\na large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be\nthe eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual\nlosses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current\nknowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and\nafter taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses,\nthat the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the\nFirm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in\nsuch proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed\nthe reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a\nresult, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular\nperiod, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan\nChase’s income for that period.\nJPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K    293\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\nNote 31 – International operations\nThe following table presents income statement and balance sheet-related information for JPMorgan Chase by major\ninternational geographic area. The Firm defines international activities for purposes of this footnote presentation\nas business transactions that involve clients residing outside of the U.S., and the information presented below is\nbased predominantly on the domicile of the client, the location from which the client relationship is managed,\nbooking location or the location of the trading desk. However, many of the Firm’s U.S. operations serve\ninternational businesses. As the Firm’s operations are highly integrated, estimates and subjective assumptions have\nbeen made to apportion revenue and expense between U.S. and international operations. These estimates and\nassumptions are consistent with the allocations used for the Firm’s segment reporting as set forth in Note 32. The\nFirm’s long-lived assets for the periods presented are not considered by management to be significant in relation\nto total assets. The majority of the Firm’s long-lived assets are located in the U.S.\nAs of or\nfor the\nyear\nended\nDecember\n31,                                                   Income\n(in                                                   before\nmillions)                                         income tax                                   Total\n2020            Revenue(c)       Expense(d)          expense       Net income                  assets\nEurope/M…    $      16,566    $      10,987    $       5,579    $       3,868    $    530,687                -e\nEast/Afr…\nAsia-Pac…            9,289            5,558            3,731            2,630         252,553\nLatin                2,740            1,590            1,150              837          61,980\nAmerica/…\nTotal               28,595           18,135           10,460            7,335         845,220\ninternat…\nNorth               90,948           66,001           24,947           21,796       2,540,851\nAmerica(…\nTotal        $     119,543    $      84,136    $      35,407    $      29,131    $  3,386,071\n2019(b)\nEurope/M…    $      15,887    $       9,860    $       6,027    $       4,158    $    391,369                -e\nEast/Afr…\nAsia-Pac…            7,254            5,060            2,194            1,467         183,023\nLatin                2,405            1,561              844              609          47,820\nAmerica/…\nTotal               25,546           16,481            9,065            6,234         622,212\ninternat…\nNorth               89,853           54,373           35,480           30,197       2,065,167\nAmerica(…\nTotal        $     115,399    $      70,854    $      44,545    $      36,431    $  2,687,379\n2018(b)\nEurope/M…    $      16,459    $      10,032    $       6,427    $       4,569    $    424,935                -e\nEast/Afr…\nAsia-Pac…            6,991            4,884            2,107            1,481         171,547\nLatin                2,365            1,301            1,064              744          43,871\nAmerica/…\nTotal               25,815           16,217            9,598            6,794         640,353\ninternat…\nNorth               82,968           51,802           31,166           25,680       1,982,179\nAmerica(…\nTotal        $     108,783    $      68,019    $      40,764    $      32,474    $  2,622,532\n(a) Substantially reflects the U.S.\n(b) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.\n(c) Revenue is composed of net interest income and noninterest revenue.\n(d) Expense is composed of noninterest expense and the provision for credit losses.\n(e) Total assets for the U.K. were approximately $ 353billion, $ 309billion and $ 299billion at December 31, 2020,\n2019 and 2018, respectively.\n294    JPMorgan Chase & Co./2020 Form 10-K\nNote 32 – Business segments\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis.

The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP\nresults and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the\nreportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and\ntax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and\nsecurities. This allows management to assess the comparability of revenue from year-to-year arising from both\ntaxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt items is recorded within\nincome tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or\nby the LOBs. Business segment capital allocation Each business segment is allocated capital by taking into\nconsideration a variety of factors including capital levels of similarly rated peers and applicable regulatory\ncapital requirements. ROE is measured and internal targets for expected returns are established as key measures of\na business segment’s performance. The Firm’s allocation methodology incorporates Basel III Standardized RWA, Basel\nIII Advanced RWA, the GSIB surcharge, and a simulation of capital in a severe stress environment. The assumptions\nand methodologies used to allocate capital are periodically assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the\nLOBs may change from time to time. Business segment changes In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Firm transferred\ncertain assets, liabilities, revenue, expense and headcount associated with certain wealth management clients from\nAWM to the J.P. Morgan Wealth Management business unit within CCB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to\nconform with the current presentation, including the transfer of approximately 1,650technology and support staff\nduring the second and third quarters of 2020. Ultra-high-net-worth and certain high-net-worth client relationships\nremained in AWM. In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within\nCIB following a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments business comprises:\nMerchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to CIB • Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade\nFinance was previously reported in Lending in CIB. In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the\nassets, liabilities and headcount associated with the Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB,\nand the revenue and expenses of the Merchant Services business are reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily\non client relationships. In the fourth quarter of 2020, payment processing-only clients along with the associated\nrevenue and expenses were realigned to CIB’s Wholesale Payments business from CCB and CB. Payment processing-only\nclients are those that only use payment services offered by Merchant Services, and in general do not currently\nutilize other services offered by the Firm.

The attribution between\nvolume and rate is calculated using annual average balances for each category of assets and liabilities shown in\nthe table and the corresponding annual rates (refer to pages 300–304 for more information on average balances and\nrates). In this analysis, when the change cannot be isolated to either volume or rate, it has been allocated to\nvolume. The annual rates include the impact of changes in market rates, as well as the impact of any change in\ncomposition of the various products within each category of asset or liability. This analysis is calculated\nseparately for each category without consideration of the relationship between categories (for example, the net\nspread between the rates earned on assets and the rates paid on liabilities that fund those assets). As a result,\nchanges in the granularity or groupings considered in this analysis would produce a different attribution result,\nand due to the complexities involved, precise allocation of changes in interest rates between volume and rates is\ninherently complex and judgmental.\n(Unaudited)\nYear ended               2020 versus                                       2019 versus\nDecember 31,                    2019                                              2018\n(On a                Increase/(decr…                                   Increase/(decr…\ntaxable-equiv…         due to change                                     due to change\nbasis; in                        in:                         Net                   in:                      Net\nmillions)                     Volume          Rate        change                Volume        Rate       change\nInterest-earn…\nassets\nDeposits with\nbanks:\nU.S.              $              333    $   -3,153    $   -2,820    $           -3,030    $    915    $  -2,115\nNon-U.S.                          -8          -310          -318                    35          60           95\nFederal funds\nsold and\nsecurities\npurchased\nunder resale\nagreements:\nU.S.                             -83        -2,644        -2,727                 1,304         337        1,641\nNon-U.S.                          81        -1,064          -983                   168         518          686\nSecurities\nborrowed:(a)\nU.S.                             -24        -1,704        -1,728                   236         362          598\nNon-U.S.                          -1          -147          -148                     2          61           63\nTrading assets\n– debt\ninstruments:(…\nU.S.                             365        -1,466        -1,101                 2,416        -488        1,928\nNon-U.S.                         336          -555          -219                   253        -198           55\nInvestment\nsecurities:\nU.S.                           3,426        -3,686          -260                 2,723        -703        2,020\nNon-U.S.                          38          -115           -77                   -79          36          -43\nLoans:(b)\nU.S.                             557        -7,907        -7,350                   890       1,941        2,831\nNon-U.S.                          74          -850          -776                  -122          95          -27\nAll other\ninterest-earn…\nassets,                          324        -1,447        -1,123                    48          63          111\npredominantly\nU.S.(b)\nChange in\ninterest                       5,418       -25,048       -19,630                 4,844       2,999        7,843\nincome\nInterest-bear…\nliabilities\nInterest-bear…\ndeposits:\nU.S.                             495        -5,103        -4,608                   407       1,927        2,334\nNon-U.S.                          25        -2,017        -1,992                   165         485          650\nFederal funds\npurchased and\nsecurities\nloaned or sold\nunder\nrepurchase\nagreements:\nU.S.                             176        -3,302        -3,126                 1,133         294        1,427\nNon-U.S.                         -51          -395          -446                   -85         222          137\nTrading\nliabilities –\ndebt,\nshort-term\nand all other\ninterest-bear…\nliabilities:\n(a)(c)\nU.S.                               2        -2,606        -2,604                    -5         354          349\nNon-U.S.                          36          -698          -662                    30         -77          -47\nBeneficial\ninterests\nissued by\nconsolidated                     -37          -317          -354                    37          38           75\nVIEs,\npredominantly\nU.S.\nLong-term\ndebt:\nU.S.                             131        -3,193        -3,062                    93         719          812\nNon-U.S.                           6            13            19                    17           —           17\nIntercompany\nfunding:\nU.S.                             -89           249           160                   293        -961         -668\nNon-U.S.                          89          -249          -160                  -293         961          668\nChange in\ninterest                         783       -17,618       -16,835                 1,792       3,962        5,754\nexpense\nChange in net\ninterest          $            4,635    $   -7,430    $   -2,795    $            3,052    $   -963    $   2,089\nincome\n(a) Negative interest income and yield are related to the impact of current interest rates combined with the fees\npaid on client-driven securities borrowed balances.

The\ncurrent estimated LTV ratios are calculated using\nestimated collateral values derived from a nationally\nrecognized home price index measured at the\nmetropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to\nthe extent available and forecasted data where actual\ndata is not available. As a result, the estimated\ncollateral values used to calculate these ratios do\nnot represent actual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are\nnecessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed\nas estimates.\nCombined LTV ratio\nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien\npositions, as well as unused lines, related to the\nproperty.

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or\nmore of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)\na high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner\noccupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio\nabove normal limits. A substantial proportion of the\nFirm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not\nprovide complete documentation of his or her assets or\nthe amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an\nadjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the\nborrower with the option each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the introductory period.\nThis introductory rate is usually significantly below\nthe fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is\ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the\nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to the fully\nindexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements\nin the index. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior\nmonth, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added\nto the principal balance of the loan.

Key differences in the calculation\nof credit risk RWA between the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,\ncredit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches\nwhich largely rely on the use of internal credit\nmodels and parameters, whereas for Basel III\nStandardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on\nsupervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by\ncounterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is\ncalculated on a generally consistent basis between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.\nS&P: Standard and Poor’s 500 Index\nSAR(s): Stock appreciation rights\nSCB: Stress Capital Buffer\nScored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that\npredominantly include residential real estate loans,\ncredit card loans, auto loans to individuals and\ncertain small business loans.\nSEC: Securities and Exchange Commission\nSecurities financing agreements: Include resale,\nrepurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned\nagreements\nSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in\nproducts, such as mutual funds, with the intention of\nensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a\nviable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its\nshares, and allowing the manager to develop a track\nrecord.

The information provided below relates to JPMorgan Chase’s full-time and part-time employees and\ndoes not include the Firm’s contractors.\nGlobal workforce\nJPMorgan Chase had 255,351 employees in 62 countries as of December 31, 2020, with over 60% of those employees\nlocated in the U.S. As of December 31, 2020, of the Firm’s global employees that self-identified, 49% self-\nidentified as women and of the Firm’s U.S.-based employees that self-identified, 52% self-identified as ethnically\ndiverse (defined as all Equal Employment Opportunity Commission classifications other than white). In addition, of\nthe Firm’s U.S.-based employees, 3% self-identified as LGBT+, 3% as military veterans and 4% as people with\ndisabilities. The following table presents the distribution of the Firm’s global workforce by region and by LOB as\nof December 31, 2020:\nEmployee Breakdown by Region                 Employee Breakdown by LOB\nRegion                          Employees    LOB                          Employees\nNorth America                     162,670    CCB                            122,894\nEurope/Middle East/Africa          22,346    CIB                             61,733\nLatin America/Caribbean             3,691    CB                              11,675\nAsia-Pacific                       66,644    AWM                             20,683\nTotal Firm                        255,351    Corporate                       38,366\nTotal Firm                     255,351\nFirm culture\nThe foundations of JPMorgan Chase’s culture are its\ncore values and How We Do Business Principles, which\nare fundamental to the Firm’s success and are\nrepresented by four central corporate tenets:\nexceptional client service; operational excellence; a\ncommitment to integrity, fairness and responsibility;\nand cultivation of a great team and winning culture.\nThe Firm maintains its focus on its culture of\ninclusion and respect, which is reinforced by\nincreasing employee awareness and education through\nengagement, communication and training. An important\npart of these efforts includes the Firm’s Business\nResource Groups, which are groups of employees who\nsupport JPMorgan Chase’s diversity and inclusion\nstrategies by leveraging the unique perspectives of\ntheir members.\nAttracting and retaining employees\nThe goal of JPMorgan Chase’s recruitment efforts is to\nattract and hire talented individuals in all roles and\nat all career levels. The Firm strives to provide both\nexternal candidates and internal employees who are\nseeking a different role with challenging and\nstimulating career opportunities. These opportunities\nrange from internship training programs for students\nto entry-level, management and executive careers.\nDuring 2020, approximately two thirds of the Firm’s\nemployment opportunities were filled by external\ncandidates, with the remainder filled by existing\nemployees.\nDiversity is a critical area of focus throughout the\nFirm’s hiring process. JPMorgan Chase engages in\nefforts aimed at hiring diverse talent, including\ninitiatives focused on gender, underrepresented ethnic\ngroups, LGBT+ individuals, people with disabilities,\nveterans and others. The Firm’s Advancing Black\nPathways program, which seeks to leverage JPMorgan\nChase’s business and philanthropic\nresources to accelerate economic opportunity for Black\nAmericans by strengthening education and job training,\ngrowing careers, investing in entrepreneurship, and\nbuilding wealth, includes initiatives to increase\nrepresentation of talented Black individuals across\nthe Firm.\nJPMorgan Chase offers a competitive fellowship program\nthat seeks to attract accomplished individuals who\nhave taken a career break and wish to return to the\nworkforce. In addition, where appropriate, the Firm’s\nhiring practices focus on the skills of a job\ncandidate rather than degrees held.\nDeveloping employees\nJPMorgan Chase is committed to supporting the\nprofessional development and career growth of its\nemployees. The Firm offers comprehensive training\nprograms to employees, with over seven million hours\nof training delivered globally in 2020. Leadership\nEdge, the Firm’s global leadership development program\nthat is offered to managers, is focused on creating\none Firm leadership culture.\nCompensation and benefits\nThe Firm provides comprehensive and market-competitive\ncompensation and benefits programs. JPMorgan Chase’s\ncompensation philosophy provides the guiding\nprinciples that drive compensation-related decisions\nacross the Firm, including pay-for-performance,\nresponsiveness and alignment with shareholder\ninterests, reinforcement of the Firm’s culture and How\nWe Do Business Principles, and integration of risk,\ncontrols and conduct considerations. The Firm’s\ncommitment to diversity and inclusion for all\nemployees includes compensation review processes that\nseek to ensure that the Firm’s employees are paid\nequitably for the work they do.\n2\nThe Firm is also committed to supporting employees’\nwell-being. JPMorgan Chase offers a comprehensive\nbenefits and wellness package to employees and their\nfamilies, including healthcare coverage, retirement\nbenefits, life and disability insurance, on-site\nhealth and wellness centers, employee assistance\nprograms, competitive vacation and leave policies,\nbackup child care arrangements, tuition reimbursement\nprograms, mental health counseling and support, and\nfinancial coaching. The Firm has taken action to\nprotect and support its employees during the COVID-19\npandemic, including by implementing health and safety\nprotocols and providing additional benefits.\nSupervision and regulation\nThe Firm is subject to extensive and comprehensive\nregulation under U.S. federal and state laws, as well\nas the applicable laws of the jurisdictions outside\nthe U.S. in which the Firm does business.\nFinancial holding company:\nConsolidated supervision . JPMorgan Chase & Co. is a\nbank holding company (“BHC”) and a financial holding\ncompany (“FHC”) under U.S. federal law, and is subject\nto comprehensive consolidated supervision, regulation\nand examination by the Board of Governors of the\nFederal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve”). The\nFederal Reserve acts as the supervisor of the\nconsolidated operations of BHCs, and certain of\nJPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries are also regulated\ndirectly by additional authorities based on the\nactivities or licenses of those subsidiaries.\nJPMorgan Chase’s national bank subsidiary, JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A., is supervised and regulated by the\nOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and,\nwith respect to certain matters, by the Federal\nDeposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”).\nJPMorgan Chase’s U.S. broker-dealers are supervised\nand regulated by the Securities and Exchange\nCommission (“SEC”) and the Financial Industry\nRegulatory Authority (“FINRA”), and subsidiaries of\nthe Firm that engage in certain futures-related and\nswaps-related activities are supervised and regulated\nby the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”).\nJ.P. Morgan Securities plc is a U.K.-based bank\nregulated by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority\n(the “PRA”) and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority\n(“FCA”).\nThe Firm’s other non-U.S. subsidiaries are regulated\nby the banking, securities, prudential and conduct\nregulatory authorities in the countries in which they\noperate.\nPermissible business activities . The Bank Holding\nCompany Act restricts BHCs from engaging in business\nactivities other than the business of banking and\ncertain closely-related activities. FHCs can engage in\na broader range of financial activities. The Federal\nReserve has the authority to limit an FHC’s ability to\nconduct otherwise permissible activities if the FHC or\nany of its depository institution subsidiaries ceases\nto meet applicable eligibility requirements. The\nFederal Reserve may also impose corrective capital\nand/or managerial requirements on the FHC, and if\ndeficiencies are persistent, may require divestiture\nof the FHC’s depository institutions. If any\ndepository institution controlled by an FHC fails to\nmaintain a satisfactory rating under the Community\nReinvestment Act, the Federal Reserve must prohibit\nthe FHC and its subsidiaries from engaging in any\nactivities other than those permissible for BHCs.\nCapital and liquidity requirements . The Federal\nReserve establishes capital, liquidity and leverage\nrequirements for JPMorgan Chase that are generally\nconsistent with the international Basel III capital\nand liquidity framework and evaluates the Firm’s\ncompliance with those requirements. The OCC\nestablishes similar requirements for JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A.\nBanking supervisors globally continue to refine and\nenhance the Basel III capital framework for financial\ninstitutions. In January 2019, the Basel Committee\nissued “Minimum capital requirements for market risk.”\nThe Basel Committee expects national regulators to\nimplement these revised market risk requirements for\nbanking organizations in their jurisdictions by\nJanuary 2023, in line with the other elements of the\nBasel III Reforms. U.S. banking regulators have\nannounced their support for the issuance of the Basel\nIII Reforms and are considering how to appropriately\napply such reforms in the U.S. In November 2019, the\nU.S. banking regulators adopted a rule implementing\n“Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit Risk”\n(“SA-CCR”), which became effective in April 2020 and\nwhich has a mandatory compliance date of January 1,\n2022.\nOn October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies\nissued a final rule for the net stable funding ratio\n(“NSFR”) under which large banking organizations such\nas the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at\nleast 100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule\nwill become effective on July 1, 2021.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 and\nLiquidity Risk Management on pages 102–108 .\nStress tests . As a large BHC, JPMorgan Chase is\nsubject to supervisory stress testing administered by\nthe Federal Reserve as part of the Federal Reserve’s\nannual Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review\n(“CCAR”) framework. The Firm must conduct annual\ncompany-run stress tests and must also submit an\nannual capital plan to the Federal Reserve, taking\ninto account the results of separate stress tests\ndesigned by the Firm and the Federal Reserve. The\nFederal Reserve uses the results under the severely\nadverse scenario from its supervisory stress test to\ndetermine the Firm’s “stress capital buffer” (“SCB”)\nrequirement for the coming year, which forms part of\nthe Firm’s applicable capital buffers. The Firm is\nrequired to file its annual CCAR submission on April\n5, 2021. The Federal Reserve will notify the Firm of\nits indicative SCB requirement by June 30, 2021 and\nfinal SCB requirement by August 31, 2021. The Firm’s\nfinal SCB requirement will become effective on October\n1, 2021. The OCC requires\n3",

          "content": "Part I\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to perform separate, similar\nstress tests annually. The Firm publishes each year\nthe results of the annual stress tests for the Firm\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. under the supervisory\n“severely adverse” scenarios provided by the Federal\nReserve and the OCC.\nRefer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 for\nmore information concerning the Firm’s CCAR.\nEnhanced prudential standards . As part of its mandate\nto identify and monitor risks to the financial\nstability of the U.S. posed by large banking\norganizations, the Financial Stability Oversight\nCouncil (“FSOC”) recommends prudential standards and\nreporting requirements to the Federal Reserve for\nsystemically important financial institutions\n(“SIFIs”), such as JPMorgan Chase. The Federal Reserve\nhas adopted several rules to implement those\nheightened prudential standards, including rules\nrelating to risk management and corporate governance\nof subject BHCs. JPMorgan Chase is required under\nthese rules to comply with enhanced liquidity and\noverall risk management standards, including oversight\nby the board of directors of risk management\nactivities.\nResolution and recovery . The Firm is required to\nsubmit periodically to the Federal Reserve and the\nFDIC a plan for resolution under Title I of the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\n(“Dodd-Frank Act”) in the event of material distress\nor failure (a “resolution plan”). In 2019, the FDIC\nand Federal Reserve revised the regulations governing\nresolution plan requirements, and on the basis of\nthose revisions, the Firm’s resolution plan\nsubmissions will alternate between “targeted” and\n“full” plans. The Firm’s next “targeted” resolution\nplan is due to be filed on or before July 1, 2021. The\nFirm also has a comprehensive recovery plan, updated\nannually, summarizing the actions it would take to\navoid failure by remaining well-capitalized and well-\nfunded in the case of an adverse event.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is also required to provide\na resolution plan to the FDIC. The FDIC has proposed\nchanges\nto its rules relating to the resolution plans of\ninsured depository institutions (“IDIs”) in a 2019\nadvanced notice of proposed rulemaking. In January\n2021, the FDIC announced that the moratorium on the\npreparation of resolution plans for the IDIs has\nended. Banks will be given notice of at least 12\nmonths prior to the required submission date for their\nIDI resolution plans. The OCC has published guidelines\nestablishing standards for recovery planning by\ninsured national banks, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nhas submitted its recovery plan to the OCC.\nCertain of the Firm’s non-U.S. subsidiaries are also\nsubject to local resolution and recovery planning\nrequirements.\nOrderly liquidation authority . Certain financial\ncompanies, including JPMorgan Chase and certain of its\nsubsidiaries, can also be subjected to resolution\nunder an “orderly liquidation authority.” The U.S.\nTreasury Secretary, in consultation with the President\nof the United States, must first make certain\ndeterminations concerning extraordinary\nfinancial distress and systemic risk, and action must\nbe recommended by the FDIC and the Federal Reserve.\nAbsent such actions, the Firm, as a BHC, would remain\nsubject to resolution under the Bankruptcy Code. The\nFDIC has issued a draft policy statement describing\nits “single point of entry” strategy for resolution of\nSIFIs under the orderly liquidation authority, which\nseeks to keep operating subsidiaries of a BHC open and\nimpose losses on shareholders and creditors of the BHC\nin receivership according to their statutory order of\npriority.\nHolding company as a source of strength. JPMorgan\nChase & Co. is required to serve as a source of\nfinancial strength for its depository institution\nsubsidiaries and to commit resources to support those\nsubsidiaries, including when directed to do so by the\nFederal Reserve.\nRegulation of acquisitions . Acquisitions by BHCs and\ntheir banks are subject to multiple requirements\nestablished by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. For\nexample, FHCs and BHCs are required to obtain the\napproval of the Federal Reserve before they may\nacquire more than 5% of the voting shares of an\nunaffiliated bank. In addition, acquisitions by\nfinancial companies are prohibited if, as a result of\nthe acquisition, the total liabilities of the\nfinancial company would exceed 10% of the total\nliabilities of all financial companies. Furthermore,\nfor certain acquisitions, the Firm must provide\nwritten notice to the Federal Reserve prior to\nacquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of\nany voting shares of any company with over $10 billion\nin assets that is engaged in activities that are\n“financial in nature.”\nVolcker Rule . The Volcker Rule prohibits banking\nentities, including the Firm, from engaging in certain\n“proprietary trading” activities, subject to\nexceptions for underwriting, market-making, risk-\nmitigating hedging and certain other activities. The\nVolcker Rule also limits the sponsorship of, and\ninvestment in, “covered funds,” and imposes limits on\ncertain transactions between the Firm and covered\nfunds for which a JPMorgan Chase entity serves as the\ninvestment manager, investment advisor, commodity\ntrading advisor or sponsor, as well as certain covered\nfunds controlled by such funds.\nOngoing obligations . The Firm remains subject to a\nconsent order entered into with the Federal Reserve\nconcerning foreign exchange trading. The Firm is also\nsubject to obligations under the terms of a Deferred\nProsecution Agreement entered into with the Department\nof Justice on September 29, 2020 relating to precious\nmetals and U.S. Treasuries markets investigations as\nwell as under a related order issued by the CFTC.\nSubsidiary banks:\nThe activities of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the\nFirm’s principal subsidiary bank, are limited to those\nspecifically authorized under the National Bank Act\nand related interpretations of the OCC. The OCC has\nauthority to bring an enforcement action against\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. for unsafe or unsound\nbanking practices, which could\n4\ninclude limiting JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s ability\nto conduct otherwise permissible activities, or\nimposing corrective capital or managerial requirements\non the bank.\nFDIC deposit insurance. The FDIC deposit insurance\nfund provides insurance coverage for certain deposits\nand is funded through assessments on banks, such as\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nFDIC powers upon a bank insolvency. Upon the\ninsolvency of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the FDIC\ncould be appointed as conservator or receiver under\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The FDIC has broad\npowers to transfer assets and liabilities without the\napproval of the institution’s creditors.\nPrompt corrective action. The Federal Deposit\nInsurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 requires\nthe relevant federal banking regulator to take “prompt\ncorrective action” with respect to a depository\ninstitution if that institution does not meet certain\ncapital adequacy standards. The Federal Reserve is\nalso authorized to take appropriate action against the\nparent BHC, such as JPMorgan Chase & Co., based on the\nundercapitalized status of any bank subsidiary. In\ncertain instances, the BHC would be required to\nguarantee the performance of the capital restoration\nplan for its undercapitalized subsidiary.\nOCC Heightened Standards. The OCC has established\nguidelines setting forth heightened standards for\nlarge banks, including minimum standards for the\ndesign and implementation of a risk governance\nframework for banks. Under these standards, a bank’s\nrisk governance framework must ensure that the bank’s\nrisk profile is easily distinguished and separate from\nthat of its parent BHC for risk management purposes.\nThe bank’s board or risk committee is responsible for\napproving the bank’s risk governance framework,\nproviding active oversight of the bank’s risk-taking\nactivities, and holding management accountable for\nadhering to the risk governance framework.\nRestrictions on transactions with affiliates. JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. and its subsidiaries are subject to\nrestrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of\ncredit to, investments in stock or securities of, and\nderivatives, securities lending and certain other\ntransactions with, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and certain\nother affiliates. These restrictions prevent JPMorgan\nChase & Co. and other affiliates from borrowing from\nsuch subsidiaries unless the loans are secured in\nspecified amounts and comply with certain other\nrequirements.\nDividend restrictions. Federal law imposes limitations\non the payment of dividends by national banks, such as\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Refer to Note 26 for the\namount of dividends that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\ncould pay, at January 1, 2021, to JPMorgan Chase\nwithout the approval of the banking regulators. The\nOCC and the Federal Reserve also have authority to\nprohibit or limit the payment of dividends of a bank\nsubsidiary that they supervise if, in the banking\nregulator’s opinion, payment of a dividend would\nconstitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of\nthe financial condition of the bank.\nDepositor preference. Under federal law, the claims of\na receiver of an IDI for administrative expense and\nthe claims of holders of U.S. deposit liabilities\n(including the FDIC and deposits in non-U.S. branches\nthat are dually payable in the U.S. and in a non-U.S.\nbranch) have priority over the claims of other\nunsecured creditors of the institution, including\ndepositors in non-U.S. branches and public\nnoteholders.\nConsumer supervision and regulation. JPMorgan Chase\nand JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are subject to\nsupervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial\nProtection Bureau (“CFPB”) with respect to federal\nconsumer protection laws, including laws relating to\nfair lending and the prohibition of unfair, deceptive\nor abusive acts or practices in connection with the\noffer, sale or provision of consumer financial\nproducts and services. The CFPB also has jurisdiction\nover small business lending activities with respect to\nfair lending and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. As\npart of its regulatory oversight, the CFPB has\nauthority to take enforcement actions against firms\nthat offer certain products and services to consumers\nusing practices that are deemed to be unfair,\ndeceptive or abusive. The Firm’s consumer activities\nare also subject to regulation under state statutes\nwhich are enforced by the Attorney General or\nempowered agency of each state.\nSecurities and broker-dealer regulation:\nThe Firm conducts securities underwriting, dealing and\nbrokerage activities in the U.S. through J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC and other non-bank broker-dealer\nsubsidiaries, all of which are subject to regulations\nof the SEC, FINRA and the New York Stock Exchange,\namong others. The Firm conducts similar securities\nactivities outside the U.S. subject to local\nregulatory requirements. In the U.K., those activities\nare conducted by J.P. Morgan Securities plc. Broker-\ndealers are subject to laws and regulations covering\nall aspects of the securities business, including\nsales and trading practices, securities offerings,\npublication of research reports, use of customer\nfunds, the financing of client purchases, capital\nstructure, record-keeping and retention, and the\nconduct of their directors, officers and employees.\nRefer to Broker-dealer regulatory capital on page 101\nfor information concerning the capital of J.P. Morgan\nSecurities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities plc.\nInvestment management regulation:\nThe Firm’s asset and wealth management businesses are\nsubject to significant regulation in jurisdictions\naround the world relating to, among other things, the\nsafeguarding and management of client assets,\nofferings of funds and marketing activities. Certain\nof the Firm’s subsidiaries are registered with, and\nsubject to oversight by, the SEC as investment\nadvisers and broker-dealers. The Firm’s registered\ninvestment advisers are subject to the fiduciary and\nother obligations imposed under the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940, as well as various state\nsecurities laws. The Firm’s bank fiduciary activities\nare subject to supervision by the OCC.\n5",

          "content": "Part I\nDerivatives regulation:\nThe Firm is subject to comprehensive regulation of its\nderivatives businesses, including regulations that\nimpose capital and margin requirements, require\ncentral clearing of standardized over-the-counter\n(“OTC”) derivatives, mandate that certain standardized\nOTC swaps be traded on regulated trading venues, and\nprovide for reporting of certain mandated information.\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC\nand J.P. Morgan Securities plc are registered with the\nCFTC as “swap dealers” and may be required to register\nwith the SEC as “security-based swap dealers.” As a\nresult, these entities are or will be subject to a\ncomprehensive regulatory framework applicable to their\nswap or security-based swap activities, including\ncapital requirements, rules requiring the\ncollateralization of uncleared swaps and security-\nbased swaps, rules regarding segregation of\ncounterparty collateral, business conduct and\ndocumentation standards, record-keeping and reporting\nobligations, and anti-fraud and anti-manipulation\nrequirements. Similar requirements have also been\nimplemented in the EU under the European Market\nInfrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) and MiFID II.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities LLC is also registered with the\nCFTC as a futures commission merchant and is a member\nof the National Futures Association.\nData, privacy and security regulation:\nThe Firm and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous\nU.S. federal, state and local as well as international\nlaws and regulations concerning data that are central\nto the Firm’s businesses, functions and operations.\nThese include laws and regulations relating to data\nprotection, privacy, data use, confidentiality,\nsecrecy, cybersecurity, technology, artificial\nintelligence, data localization and storage, data\nretention and destruction, disclosure, transfer,\navailability, integrity and other similar matters. The\napplication, interpretation and enforcement of these\nlaws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly\nin light of new and rapidly evolving data-driven\ntechnologies and significant increase in computing\npower. These laws and regulations are evolving at a\nrapid pace, remain a focus of regulators globally, may\nbe enforced by private parties or government bodies,\nand will continue to have a significant impact on all\nof the Firm’s businesses and operations. For example,\nthe EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”)\nincludes a complex range of obligations and\noperational requirements for companies that receive or\nprocess personal data of persons in the EU and\nprovides for significant penalties for non-compliance.\nIn addition, there are a number of legislative\nproposals in the EU, the U.S. (at both the federal and\nstate level) as well as other jurisdictions that could\nimpose new obligations or limitations in these areas\nthat could affect the Firm’s businesses.\nThe Bank Secrecy Act and Economic Sanctions:\nThe Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) requires all financial\ninstitutions, including banks and securities broker-\ndealers, to establish a risk-based system of internal\ncontrols reasonably designed to prevent money\nlaundering and the financing of\nterrorism. The BSA includes a variety of record-\nkeeping and reporting requirements, as well as due\ndiligence/know-your-customer documentation\nrequirements. The Firm is also subject to the\nregulations and economic sanctions programs\nadministered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign\nAssets Control (“OFAC”). In addition, the EU and the\nU.K. have adopted various economic sanctions programs\ntargeted at entities or individuals that are, or are\nlocated in countries that are, involved in terrorism,\nhostilities, embezzlement or human rights violations.\nAnti-Corruption:\nThe Firm is subject to laws and regulations relating\nto corrupt and illegal payments to government\nofficials and others in the jurisdictions in which it\noperates, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct and the U.K. Bribery Act.\nCompensation practices:\nThe Firm’s compensation practices are subject to\noversight by the Federal Reserve, as well as other\nagencies. The Federal Reserve has issued guidance\njointly with the FDIC and the OCC that is designed to\nensure that incentive compensation paid by banking\norganizations does not encourage imprudent risk-taking\nthat threatens the organizations’ safety and\nsoundness. The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) has\nalso established standards covering compensation\nprinciples for banks. The Firm’s compensation\npractices are also subject to regulation and oversight\nby regulators in other jurisdictions, notably the EU\nFourth Capital Requirements Directive (“CRD IV”),\nwhich includes compensation-related provisions. The\nEuropean Banking Authority has instituted guidelines\non compensation policies which in certain countries,\nsuch as the U.K. and Germany, are implemented or\nsupplemented by local regulations or guidelines. The\nFirm expects that the implementation of regulatory\nguidelines regarding compensation in the U.S. and\nother countries will continue to evolve, and may\naffect the manner in which the Firm structures its\ncompensation programs and practices.\nOther significant international regulatory\ninitiatives:\nThe U.K.’s transition period for its departure from\nthe EU, which is commonly referred to as “Brexit,”\nformally ended on December 31, 2020, and accordingly,\nfrom January 1, 2021, the U.K. is no longer obligated\nto implement EU laws.\nIn preparation for the completion of Brexit, numerous\nEU laws and regulations were separately adopted into\nU.K. domestic legislation in order to ensure\ncontinuity. However, the U.K. plans to evaluate the\nextent to which these EU-legacy laws and regulations\nshould change going forward and has already indicated\nsome areas where it may take a different approach from\nthe EU. For example, the U.K. announced it will\ndevelop a U.K. settlement discipline regime rather\nthan adopting the EU’s settlement discipline regime\nwhich will apply in the EU beginning in February 2022.\nAdditionally, the U.K. will not incorporate into U.K.\nlaw the reporting obligation of the EU’s Securities\nFinancing Transactions Regulation for non-financial\ncounterparties, which will apply in the EU beginning\nin January 2021. The\n6\nfull impact of these differences is not yet known as\nfurther details have not yet been published.\nIn the EU, policymakers continue to implement an\nextensive and complex program of regulatory\nenhancement relating to financial services, several\nkey elements of which are discussed below .\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in July 2020,\nthe European Commission (“EC”) published a legislative\nproposal amending the Markets in Financial Instruments\nDirective (“MiFID II”) . MiFID II requires the trading\nof shares and certain OTC derivatives to take place on\ntrading venues, and also significantly enhanced\nrequirements for pre- and post-trade transparency,\ntransaction reporting and investor protection, and\nintroduced a position limits and reporting regime for\ncommodities. The EC’s proposal included targeted\nchanges to the MiFID II framework intended to reduce\nthe compliance burden on financial services firms as\npart of the EC’s broader initiative to assist in the\nEU’s economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The\nproposed changes include amendments to the commodity\nderivatives regime, investor protection rules and\nrules relating to research on small and medium-sized\nEnterprises. The proposal is in the final stages of\nbecoming EU law and is expected to go into effect in\n2022.The EC has also begun a review of the broader\nMiFID II framework and is expected to publish a\nfurther legislative proposal for changes to MiFID II\nin 2021. The U.K. is also re-evaluating the MiFID II\nframework and how the U.K. version of MiFID II will\napply going forward.\nThe EU capital and liquidity legislation for banks and\ninvestment firms implemented many of the finalized\nBasel III capital and liquidity standards, including\nin relation to the leverage ratio, market risk\ncapital, and a net stable funding ratio. These\nrequirements will begin to take effect from June 2021.\nEU legislation also includes a requirement for certain\nnon-EU banks operating in the EU to establish an\nintermediate parent undertaking (“IPU”) located in the\nEU. The IPU rule will allow a second IPU to be\nestablished if a single IPU would conflict with “home\ncountry” bank separation rules or impede\nresolvability. The Firm will be required to establish\na legal entity structure that complies with the EU’s\nIPU rule. The U.K. Government has delayed the\neffective date of the U.K. version of the EU’s\nlegislation relating to changes in Basel III\nrequirements until January 1, 2022. The Basel\nCommittee recently finalized certain changes to the\nBasel III framework, including revisions to the credit\nrisk and operational risk calculation methods. The\nFirm’s banking entities in the U.K. and EU will be\nrequired to comply with these changes when they are\nimplemented in those jurisdictions.\nThe Prudential Regulatory Authority (“PRA”) and\nEuropean Central Bank (“ECB”) have published their\nsupervisory expectations applicable to U.K. and EU\nbanks, respectively, for management of financial risks\narising from climate change. The supervisory\nexpectations for managing these risks address bank\nstrategy, risk management, scenario analysis and\ndisclosure. U.K. banking entities, including J.P.\nMorgan Securities plc, will be expected to align their\npractices with PRA expectations by the end of 2021.\nJ.P. Morgan Securities plc is expanding its risk\nmanagement framework to comply with PRA expectations\nby the end of 2021.\n7",

The\nCOVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the\npandemic led to the institution of social distancing\nand shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of\nthe U.S. and other countries resulting in ongoing\nsevere impacts on global economic conditions,\nincluding:\nsignificant disruption and volatility in the\nfinancial markets\nsignificant disruption of global supply chains, and\nclosures of many businesses, leading to loss of\nrevenues and increased unemployment.\nA prolongation or worsening of the pandemic, or the\nemergence of other diseases that give rise to similar\neffects, could deepen the adverse impact on the global\neconomy.\nThe adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic\nhave had a negative impact on certain of JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses and results of operations,\nincluding:\nreduction in demand for certain products and\nservices from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers,\nresulting in lower revenue, and\nincreases in the allowance for credit losses.\nCertain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection\nwith the determination of the allowance for credit\nlosses have heightened performance risk in the\neconomic environment precipitated by the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. There\ncan be no assurance that, even after adjustments have\nbeen made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not\nrecognize unexpected losses arising from the model\nuncertainty that has resulted from these developments.\nA prolongation or worsening of the COVID-19 pandemic\nand the negative economic impacts of the pandemic\ncould have other significant adverse effects on\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of operations and\nfinancial condition, including:\nrecognition of credit losses and further increases\nin the allowance for credit losses, especially to the\nextent that businesses remain closed, unemployment\ncontinues at elevated levels, clients and customers\ndraw on their lines of credit or significant numbers\nof people relocate from metropolitan areas\nmaterial impacts on the value of securities,\nderivatives and other financial instruments which\nJPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets\ndowngrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings\nconstraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated\nlevels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets\n(“RWA”) related to supporting client activities,\ndowngrades in client credit ratings, regulatory\nactions or other factors, any or all of which could\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking\nactions that it otherwise would under its liquidity\nand capital management strategies, and\nthe possibility that significant portions of\nJPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work\neffectively, including because of illness,\nquarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government\nactions or other restrictions in connection with the\npandemic.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively\naffects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of\noperations and financial condition, as well as its\nregulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend\non future developments that are highly uncertain and\ncannot be predicted, including the ultimate scope and\nduration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of\nvaccination programs and actions taken by governmental\nauthorities and other third parties in response to the\npandemic. Those negative effects, including the\npossible recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed\n9",

To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic\nadversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results\nof operations and financial condition, it may also\nhave the effect of heightening many of the other risks\ndescribed below.\nRegulatory\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses are highly regulated, and\nexisting, new or changed laws, rules and regulations\nthat apply to JPMorgan Chase have a significant impact\non its business and operations.\nJPMorgan Chase is a financial services firm with\noperations worldwide. JPMorgan Chase must comply with\nthe laws, rules and regulations that apply to its\noperations in all of the jurisdictions around the\nworld in which it does business. Regulation of the\nfinancial services industry is extensive.\nThe regulation and supervision of financial services\nfirms has expanded significantly over an extended\nperiod of time. The increased regulation and\nsupervision of JPMorgan Chase has affected the way\nthat it conducts its business and structures its\noperations. JPMorgan Chase could be required to make\nfurther changes to its business and operations in\nresponse to expanded supervision, new laws, rules and\nregulations, and changes to existing laws, rules and\nregulations. These changes could result in JPMorgan\nChase incurring additional costs for complying with\nlaws, rules and regulations and could reduce its\nprofitability. In response to new and existing laws,\nrules and regulations and expanded supervision,\nJPMorgan Chase has in the past been and could in the\nfuture be, required to:\nlimit the products and services that it offers\nreduce the liquidity that it can provide through its\nmarket-making activities\nrefrain from engaging in business opportunities that\nit might otherwise pursue\npay higher taxes, assessments, levies or other\ngovernmental charges, including in connection with the\nresolution of tax examinations\ndispose of certain assets, and do so at times or\nprices that are disadvantageous\nimpose restrictions on certain business activities,\nor\nincrease the prices that it charges for products and\nservices, which could reduce the demand for them.\nIn particular, JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results\nof operations could be adversely impacted by changes\nin laws, rules and regulations, or changes in the\napplication, interpretation or enforcement of laws,\nrules and regulations, that:\nproscribe or institute more stringent restrictions\non certain financial services activities, or\nintroduce changes to antitrust or anti-competition\nlaws, rules and regulations that adversely affect the\nbusiness activities of JPMorgan Chase.\nDifferences in financial services regulation can be\ndisadvantageous for JPMorgan Chase’s business.\nThe content and application of laws, rules and\nregulations affecting financial services firms\nsometimes vary according to factors such as the size\nof the firm, the jurisdiction in which it is organized\nor operates, and other criteria. For example:\nlarger firms such as JPMorgan Chase are often\nsubject to more stringent supervision and regulation\nfinancial technology companies and other non-\ntraditional competitors may not be subject to banking\nregulation, or may be supervised by a national or\nstate regulatory agency that does not have the same\nresources or regulatory priorities as the regulatory\nagencies which supervise more diversified financial\nservices firms, or\nthe financial services regulatory framework in a\nparticular jurisdiction may favor financial\ninstitutions that are based in that jurisdiction.\nThese differences in the regulatory framework can\nresult in a firm such as JPMorgan Chase losing market\nshare to competitors that are less regulated or not\nsubject to regulation, especially with respect to\nunregulated financial products.\nThere can also be significant differences in the ways\nthat similar regulatory initiatives affecting the\nfinancial services industry are implemented in the\nU.S. and in other countries and regions in which\nJPMorgan Chase does business. For example, when\nadopting rules that are intended to implement a global\nregulatory standard, a national regulator may\nintroduce additional or more restrictive requirements,\nwhich can create competitive disadvantages for\nfinancial services firms, such as JPMorgan Chase, that\nmay be subject to those enhanced regulations.\nLegislative and regulatory initiatives outside the\nU.S. could require JPMorgan Chase to make significant\nmodifications to its operations and legal entity\nstructure in the relevant\n10\ncountries or regions in order to comply with those\nrequirements. These include laws, rules and\nregulations that have been adopted or proposed\nrelating to:\nthe establishment of locally-based intermediate\nholding companies or operating subsidiaries\nrequirements to maintain minimum amounts of capital\nor liquidity in locally-based subsidiaries\nthe separation (or “ring fencing”) of core banking\nproducts and services from markets activities\nthe resolution of financial institutions\nrequirements for executing or settling transactions\non exchanges or through central counterparties\n(“CCPs”)\nposition limits and reporting rules for derivatives\ngovernance and accountability regimes\nconduct of business and control requirements, and\nrestrictions on compensation.\nThese types of differences in financial services\nregulation, or inconsistencies or conflicts between\nlaws, rules and regulations between different\njurisdictions, have required and could in the future\nrequire JPMorgan Chase to:\ndivest assets or restructure its operations\nabsorb increased operational, capital and liquidity\ncosts\nchange the prices that it charges for its products\nand services\ncurtail the products and services that it offers to\nits customers and clients, or\nincur higher costs for complying with different\nlegal and regulatory frameworks.\nAny or all of these factors could harm JPMorgan\nChase’s ability to compete against other firms that\nare not subject to the same laws, rules and\nregulations or supervisory oversight, or harm JPMorgan\nChase’s businesses, results of operations and\nprofitability.\nHeightened regulatory scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses could result in higher compliance costs and\nrestrictions on its operations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations are subject to heightened\noversight and scrutiny from regulatory authorities in\nmany jurisdictions. JPMorgan Chase has paid\nsignificant fines, provided other monetary relief,\nincurred other penalties and experienced other\nrepercussions in connection with resolving\ninvestigations and enforcement actions by governmental\nagencies. JPMorgan Chase could become subject to\nsimilar regulatory resolutions or other actions in the\nfuture, and addressing the requirements of any such\nresolutions or actions could result in JPMorgan Chase\nincurring higher operational and compliance costs or\nneeding to comply with other restrictions.\nIn connection with resolving specific regulatory\ninvestigations or enforcement actions, certain\nregulators have required JPMorgan Chase and other\nfinancial institutions to admit wrongdoing with\nrespect to the activities that gave rise to the\nresolution. These types of admissions can lead to:\ngreater exposure in litigation\ndamage to reputation\ndisqualification from doing business with certain\nclients or customers, or in specific jurisdictions, or\nother direct and indirect adverse effects.\nFurthermore, U.S. government officials have\ndemonstrated a willingness to bring criminal actions\nagainst financial institutions and have required that\ninstitutions plead guilty to criminal offenses or\nadmit other wrongdoing in connection with resolving\nregulatory investigations or enforcement actions.\nResolutions of this type can have significant\ncollateral consequences for the subject financial\ninstitution, including:\nloss of clients, customers and business\nrestrictions on offering certain products or\nservices, and\nlosing permission to operate certain businesses,\neither temporarily or permanently.\nJPMorgan Chase expects that:\nit and other financial services firms will continue\nto be subject to heightened regulatory scrutiny and\ngovernmental investigations and enforcement actions\nregulators will continue to require that financial\ninstitutions be penalized for actual or deemed\nviolations of law with formal and punitive enforcement\nactions, including the imposition of significant\nmonetary and other sanctions, rather than resolving\nthese matters through informal supervisory actions;\nand\nregulators will be more likely to pursue formal\nenforcement actions and resolutions against JPMorgan\nChase to the extent that it has previously been\nsubject to other governmental investigations or\nenforcement actions.\nIf JPMorgan Chase fails to meet the requirements of\nany resolution of a governmental investigation or\nenforcement action, or to maintain risk and control\nprocesses that meet the heightened standards\nestablished by its regulators, it could be required\nto:\nenter into further resolutions of investigations or\nenforcement actions\npay additional regulatory fines, penalties or\njudgments, or\naccept material regulatory restrictions on, or\nchanges in the management of, its businesses.\n11",

          "content": "Part I\nIn these circumstances, JPMorgan Chase could also\nbecome subject to other sanctions, or to prosecution\nor civil litigation with respect to the conduct that\ngave rise to an investigation or enforcement action.\nComplying with economic sanctions and anti-corruption\nand anti-money laundering laws, rules and regulations\ncan increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and\ncompliance costs and risks.\nJPMorgan Chase must comply with economic sanctions and\nembargo programs administered by the Office of Foreign\nAssets Control (“OFAC”) and similar national and\nmulti-national bodies and governmental agencies\noutside the U.S., as well as anti-corruption and anti-\nmoney laundering laws, rules and regulations\nthroughout the world. JPMorgan Chase can incur higher\ncosts and face greater compliance risks in structuring\nand operating its businesses to comply with these\nrequirements. Certain governments have enacted laws,\nwhich are commonly referred to as “blocking laws,”\nthat are designed to prohibit compliance with some\nU.S. sanctions and may raise significant conflict of\nlaws issues. A violation of a sanction or embargo\nprogram or anti-corruption or anti-money laundering\nlaws, rules and regulations, or enforcement of\nblocking laws, could subject JPMorgan Chase, and\nindividual employees, to regulatory enforcement\nactions as well as significant civil and criminal\npenalties.\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations and financial results can\nbe negatively impacted in countries with less\npredictable legal and regulatory frameworks .\nJPMorgan Chase conducts business in certain countries\nin which the application of the rule of law is\ninconsistent or less predictable, including with\nrespect to:\nthe absence of a statutory or regulatory basis or\nguidance for engaging in specific types of business or\ntransactions\nconflicting or ambiguous laws, rules and\nregulations, or the inconsistent application or\ninterpretation of existing laws, rules and regulations\nuncertainty concerning the enforceability of\ncontractual, intellectual property or other\nobligations\ndifficulty in competing in economies in which the\ngovernment controls or protects all or a portion of\nthe local economy or specific businesses, or where\ngraft or corruption may be pervasive, and\nthe threat of arbitrary regulatory investigations,\ncivil litigations or criminal prosecutions, the\ntermination of licenses required to operate in the\nlocal market or the suspension of business\nrelationships with governmental bodies.\nIf the application of the laws, rules and regulations\nin a particular country is susceptible to producing\ninconsistent or unexpected outcomes, this can create a\nmore difficult environment in which JPMorgan Chase\nconducts its business and could negatively affect\nJPMorgan Chase’s operations\nand reduce its earnings with respect to that country.\nFor example, conducting business could require\nJPMorgan Chase to devote significant additional\nresources to understanding, and monitoring changes in,\nlocal laws, rules and regulations, as well as\nstructuring its operations to comply with local laws,\nrules and regulations and implementing and\nadministering related internal policies and\nprocedures.\nThere can be no assurance that JPMorgan Chase will\nalways be successful in its efforts to fully\nunderstand and to conduct its business in compliance\nwith the laws, rules and regulations of all of the\njurisdictions in which it operates, and the risk of\nnon-compliance can be greater in countries that have\nless predictable legal and regulatory systems.\nRequirements for the orderly resolution of JPMorgan\nChase could result in JPMorgan Chase having to\nrestructure or reorganize its businesses and could\nincrease its funding or operational costs or curtail\nits business.\nJPMorgan Chase is required under Federal Reserve and\nFDIC rules to prepare and submit periodically to those\nagencies a detailed plan for rapid and orderly\nresolution in bankruptcy, without extraordinary\ngovernment support, in the event of material financial\ndistress or failure. The agencies’ evaluation of\nJPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan may change, and the\nrequirements for resolution plans may be modified from\ntime to time. Any such determinations or modifications\ncould result in JPMorgan Chase needing to make changes\nto its legal entity structure or to certain internal\nor external activities, which could increase its\nfunding or operational costs, or hamper its ability to\nserve clients and customers.\nIf the Federal Reserve and the FDIC were both to\ndetermine that a resolution plan submitted by JPMorgan\nChase has deficiencies, they could jointly impose more\nstringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements\nor restrictions on JPMorgan Chase’s growth, activities\nor operations. The agencies could also require that\nJPMorgan Chase restructure, reorganize or divest\nassets or businesses in ways that could materially and\nadversely affect JPMorgan Chase’s operations and\nstrategy.\nHolders of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s debt and equity\nsecurities will absorb losses if it were to enter into\na resolution.\nFederal Reserve rules require that JPMorgan Chase &\nCo. (the “Parent Company”) maintain minimum levels of\nunsecured external long-term debt and other loss-\nabsorbing capacity with specific terms (“eligible\nLTD”) for purposes of recapitalizing JPMorgan Chase’s\noperating subsidiaries if the Parent Company were to\nenter into a resolution either:\nin a bankruptcy proceeding under Chapter 11 of the\nU.S. Bankruptcy Code, or\nin a receivership administered by the FDIC under\nTitle II of the Dodd-Frank Act (“Title II”).\n12\nIf the Parent Company were to enter into a resolution,\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company will absorb the\nlosses of the Parent Company and its subsidiaries.\nThe preferred “single point of entry” strategy under\nJPMorgan Chase’s resolution plan contemplates that\nonly the Parent Company would enter bankruptcy\nproceedings. JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries would be\nrecapitalized, as needed, so that they could continue\nnormal operations or subsequently be divested or wound\ndown in an orderly manner. As a result, the Parent\nCompany’s losses and any losses incurred by its\nsubsidiaries would be imposed first on holders of the\nParent Company’s equity securities and thereafter on\nits unsecured creditors, including holders of eligible\nLTD and other debt securities. Claims of holders of\nthose securities would have a junior position to the\nclaims of creditors of JPMorgan Chase’s subsidiaries\nand to the claims of priority (as determined by\nstatute) and secured creditors of the Parent Company.\nAccordingly, in a resolution of the Parent Company in\nbankruptcy, holders of eligible LTD and other debt\nsecurities of the Parent Company would realize value\nonly to the extent available to the Parent Company as\na shareholder of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and its\nother subsidiaries, and only after any claims of\npriority and secured creditors of the Parent Company\nhave been fully repaid.\nThe FDIC has similarly indicated that a single point\nof entry recapitalization model could be a desirable\nstrategy to resolve a systemically important financial\ninstitution, such as the Parent Company, under Title\nII. However, the FDIC has not formally adopted a\nsingle point of entry resolution strategy.\nIf the Parent Company were to approach, or enter into,\na resolution, none of the Parent Company, the Federal\nReserve or the FDIC is obligated to follow JPMorgan\nChase’s preferred resolution strategy, and losses to\nholders of eligible LTD and other debt and equity\nsecurities of the Parent Company, under whatever\nstrategy is ultimately followed, could be greater than\nthey might have been under JPMorgan Chase’s preferred\nstrategy.\nRegulatory uncertainties associated with the U.K.’s\ndeparture from the EU could negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s business, results of operations and operating\nmodel.\nThe U.K.’s departure from the EU, which is commonly\nreferred to as “Brexit,” was completed on December 31,\n2020. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement entered into\nbetween the U.K. and the EU in December 2020 included\nvery limited provisions relating to the conduct of\nfinancial services activities between the U.K. and the\nEU. Accordingly, unless or until the U.K. and the EU\nenter into further agreements relating to financial\nservices, the regulatory environment for financial\nservices in the aftermath of Brexit can be expected\nto:\nsignificantly limit the ability of U.K.-based\nfinancial services firms to conduct business in the\nEU, and vice versa\nprolong uncertainty concerning the levels of market\naccess for trading venues, which could result in a\nreduction or fragmentation of market liquidity, and\nprolong ongoing uncertainties concerning optimal\nbusiness models for firms providing financial\nservices, especially given that any changes in the\nregulation of such services by the U.K. may not\nbenefit from equivalence determinations by the EU.\nAs a result of these limitations and uncertainties,\nJPMorgan Chase:\nhas made and is continuing to make appropriate\nchanges to its legal entity structure and operations\nin the U.K. and the EU to address the regulatory\nenvironment\nis now maintaining, and expects that it will be\nrequired to sustain, a more fragmented operating model\nacross its U.K. and EU operating entities, and\nexpects that, due to considerations such as\noperating expenses, liquidity, leverage and capital,\nthis modified European operating framework will be\nmore complex, less efficient and more costly than\nwould otherwise have been the case.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and EU and U.K.\ngovernment responses to the pandemic, including travel\nrestrictions and lock-downs, have introduced delays\nand uncertainties into JPMorgan Chase’s implementation\nof its plans for maintaining continuity of service for\nits clients.\nAny or all of the above factors could have an adverse\neffect on the overall operation of the financial\nservices market across the U.K. and the EU as well as\nJPMorgan Chase’s business, operations and earnings in\nthe U.K., the EU and globally.\nPolitical\nEconomic uncertainty or instability caused by\npolitical developments can hurt JPMorgan Chase’s\nbusinesses.\nThe economic environment and market conditions in\nwhich JPMorgan Chase operates continue to be uncertain\ndue to political developments in the U.S. and other\ncountries. Certain monetary, fiscal and other policy\ninitiatives and proposals could cause a contraction in\nU.S. and global economic growth and higher volatility\nin the financial markets, including :\nmonetary policies and actions taken by the Federal\nReserve and other central banks or governmental\nauthorities, including any sustained large-scale asset\npurchases or any suspension or reversal of those\nactions\nfiscal policies, including with respect to taxation\n13",

and capital levels,\nand thereby constrain the growth of its businesses.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses can be negatively\naffected by adverse economic conditions.\nJPMorgan Chase’s consumer businesses are particularly\naffected by U.S. and global economic conditions,\nincluding:\npersonal and household income distribution\nunemployment or underemployment\nprolonged periods of

consumers are less able to service\ntheir debts. In addition, sustained low growth, low or\nnegative interest rates, inflationary pressures or\nrecessionary conditions could diminish customer demand\nfor the products and services offered by JPMorgan\nChase’s consumer businesses.\nAdverse economic conditions could also lead to an\nincrease in delinquencies, additions to the allowance\nfor credit losses and higher net charge-offs, which\ncan reduce JPMorgan Chase’s earnings. These\nconsequences could be significantly worse in certain\ngeographies and industry segments where economic\nrestrictions and shutdowns have occurred related to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, declining industrial or\nmanufacturing activity that has resulted in or could\nresult in higher levels of unemployment, or where high\nlevels of consumer debt, such as outstanding student\nloans, could impair the ability of customers to pay\ntheir other consumer loan obligations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its consumer businesses\ncould also be adversely affected by governmental\npolicies and actions that affect consumers, including:\npolicies and initiatives relating to medical\ninsurance, education, immigration, employment status\nand housing, and\npolicies aimed at the economy more broadly, such as\nhigher taxes and increased regulation which could\nresult in reductions in consumer disposable income.\nIn addition, governmental proposals to permit student\nloan obligations to be discharged in bankruptcy\nproceedings could, if enacted into law, encourage\ncertain of JPMorgan Chase’s customers to declare\npersonal bankruptcy and\nthereby trigger defaults and charge-offs of credit\ncard and other consumer loans extended to those\ncustomers.\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions can have an\nadverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale\nbusinesses.\nIn JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale businesses, market and\neconomic factors can affect the volume of transactions\nthat JPMorgan Chase executes for its clients or for\nwhich it advises clients, and, therefore, the revenue\nthat JPMorgan Chase receives from those transactions.\nThese factors can also influence the willingness of\nother financial institutions and investors to\nparticipate in capital markets transactions that\nJPMorgan Chase manages, such as loan syndications or\nsecurities underwritings. Furthermore, if a\nsignificant and sustained deterioration in market\nconditions were to occur, the profitability of\nJPMorgan Chase’s capital markets businesses, including\nits loan syndication, securities underwriting and\nleveraged lending activities, could be reduced to the\nextent that those businesses:\nearn less fee revenue due to lower transaction\nvolumes, including when clients are unwilling or\nunable to refinance their outstanding debt obligations\nin unfavorable market conditions, or\ndispose of portions of credit commitments at a loss,\nor hold larger residual positions in credit\ncommitments that cannot be sold at favorable prices.\nAn adverse change in market conditions in particular\nsegments of the economy, such as a sudden and severe\ndownturn in oil and gas prices or an increase in\ncommodity prices, could have a material adverse effect\non clients of JPMorgan Chase whose operations or\nfinancial condition are directly or indirectly\ndependent on the health or stability of those market\nsegments, as well as clients that are engaged in\nrelated businesses. JPMorgan Chase could incur losses\non its loans and other credit commitments to clients\nthat operate in, or are dependent on, any sector of\nthe economy that is under stress.\nThe fees that JPMorgan Chase earns from managing\nclient assets or holding assets under custody for\nclients could be diminished by declining asset values\nor other adverse macroeconomic conditions. For\nexample, higher interest rates or a downturn in\nfinancial markets could affect the valuations of\nclient assets that JPMorgan Chase manages or holds\nunder custody, which, in turn, could affect JPMorgan\nChase’s revenue from fees that are based on the amount\nof assets under management or custody. Similarly,\nadverse macroeconomic or market conditions could\nprompt outflows from JPMorgan Chase funds or accounts,\nor cause clients to invest in products that generate\nlower revenue. Substantial and unexpected withdrawals\nfrom a JPMorgan Chase fund can also hamper the\ninvestment performance of the fund, particularly if\nthe outflows create the need for the fund to dispose\nof fund assets at disadvantageous times or prices, and\ncould lead to further withdrawals based on the weaker\ninvestment performance.\n15",

          "content": "Part I\nAn economic downturn that results in lower consumer\nand business spending could also have a negative\nimpact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s wholesale\nclients, and thereby diminish JPMorgan Chase’s\nearnings from its wholesale operations. For example,\nthe businesses of certain of JPMorgan Chase’s\nwholesale clients are dependent on consistent streams\nof rental income from commercial real estate\nproperties which are owned or being built by those\nclients. Severe and sustained adverse economic\nconditions, including higher unemployment caused by\nthe COVID-19 pandemic and governmental actions taken\nin response to the pandemic, could result in\nreductions in the rental cash flows that owners or\ndevelopers receive from their tenants which, in turn,\ncould depress the values of the properties and impair\nthe ability of borrowers to service or refinance their\ncommercial real estate loans. These consequences could\nresult in JPMorgan Chase experiencing higher\ndelinquencies, defaults and write-offs within its\ncommercial real estate loan portfolio and incurring\nhigher costs for servicing a larger volume of\ndelinquent loans in that portfolio, thereby reducing\nJPMorgan Chase’s earnings from its wholesale\nbusinesses.\nChanges in interest rates and credit spreads can\nadversely affect certain of JPMorgan Chase’s revenue\nand income streams related to the Firm’s traditional\nbanking and funding activities.\nIn general, a low or negative interest rate\nenvironment may cause:\nnet interest margins to be compressed, which could\nreduce the amounts that JPMorgan Chase earns on its\ninvestment securities portfolio to the extent that it\nis unable to reinvest contemporaneously in higher-\nyielding instruments\nunanticipated or adverse changes in depositor\nbehavior, which could negatively affect JPMorgan\nChase’s broader asset and liability management\nstrategy\nJPMorgan Chase to reduce the amount of deposits that\nit accepts from customers and clients, which could\nresult in lower revenues, and\na reduction in the value of JPMorgan Chase’s\nmortgage servicing rights (“MSRs”) asset, thereby\ndecreasing revenues.\nWhen credit spreads widen, it becomes more expensive\nfor JPMorgan Chase to borrow. JPMorgan Chase’s credit\nspreads may widen or narrow not only in response to\nevents and circumstances that are specific to JPMorgan\nChase but also as a result of general economic and\ngeopolitical events and conditions. Changes in\nJPMorgan Chase’s credit spreads will affect,\npositively or negatively, JPMorgan Chase’s earnings on\ncertain liabilities, such as derivatives, that are\nrecorded at fair value.\nWhen interest rates are increasing, JPMorgan Chase can\ngenerally be expected to earn higher net interest\nincome. However, higher interest rates can also lead\nto:\nfewer originations of commercial and residential\nreal estate loans\nlosses on underwriting exposures\nthe loss of deposits, including in the event that\nJPMorgan Chase makes incorrect assumptions about\ndepositor behavior\nlower net interest income if central banks introduce\ninterest rate increases more quickly than anticipated\nand this results in a misalignment in the pricing of\nshort-term and long-term borrowings\nless liquidity in the financial markets, and\nhigher funding costs.\nAll of these outcomes could adversely affect JPMorgan\nChase’s revenues and its liquidity and capital levels.\nHigher interest rates can also negatively affect the\npayment performance on loans within JPMorgan Chase’s\nconsumer and wholesale loan portfolios that are linked\nto variable interest rates. If borrowers of variable\nrate loans are unable to afford higher interest\npayments, those borrowers may reduce or stop making\npayments, thereby causing JPMorgan Chase to incur\nlosses and increased operational costs related to\nservicing a higher volume of delinquent loans.\nJPMorgan Chase’s results may be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations and significant changes in the\nvalue of financial instruments.\nThe value of securities, derivatives and other\nfinancial instruments which JPMorgan Chase owns or in\nwhich it makes markets can be materially affected by\nmarket fluctuations. Market volatility, illiquid\nmarket conditions and other disruptions in the\nfinancial markets may make it extremely difficult to\nvalue certain financial instruments. Subsequent\nvaluations of financial instruments in future periods,\nin light of factors then prevailing, may result in\nsignificant changes in the value of these instruments.\nIn addition, at the time of any disposition of these\nfinancial instruments, the price that JPMorgan Chase\nultimately realizes will depend on the demand and\nliquidity in the market at that time and may be\nmaterially lower than their current fair value. Any of\nthese factors could cause a decline in the value of\nJPMorgan Chase’s financial instruments which may have\nan adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s results of\noperations.\nJPMorgan Chase’s risk management and monitoring\nprocesses, including its stress testing framework,\nseek to quantify and control JPMorgan Chase’s exposure\nto more extreme market moves. However, JPMorgan\nChase’s hedging and other risk management strategies\nmay not be effective, and it could incur significant\nlosses, if extreme market events were to occur.\n16\nCredit\nJPMorgan Chase can be negatively affected by adverse\nchanges in the financial condition of clients,\ncounterparties, custodians and CCPs.\nJPMorgan Chase routinely executes transactions with\nclients and counterparties such as corporations,\nfinancial institutions, asset managers, hedge funds,\nexchanges and government entities within and outside\nthe U.S. Many of these transactions expose JPMorgan\nChase to the credit risk of its clients and\ncounterparties, and can involve JPMorgan Chase in\ndisputes and litigation if a client or counterparty\ndefaults. JPMorgan Chase can also be subject to losses\nor liability where a financial institution that it has\nappointed to provide custodial services for client\nassets or funds becomes insolvent as a result of fraud\nor the failure to abide by existing laws and\nobligations, including under the EU Alternative\nInvestment Fund Managers Directive.\nA default by, or the financial or operational failure\nof, a CCP through which JPMorgan Chase executes\ncontracts would require JPMorgan Chase to replace\nthose contracts, thereby increasing its operational\ncosts and potentially resulting in losses. JPMorgan\nChase can also be exposed to losses if a member of a\nCCP in which JPMorgan Chase is also a member defaults\non its obligations to the CCP because of requirements\nthat each member of the CCP absorb a portion of those\nlosses. As part of its clearing services activities,\nJPMorgan Chase is also exposed to the risk of\nnonperformance by its clients, which it seeks to\nmitigate by requiring clients to provide adequate\ncollateral. JPMorgan Chase is also exposed to intra-\nday credit risk of its clients in connection with\nproviding cash management, clearing, custodial and\nother transaction services to those clients. If a\nclient for which JPMorgan Chase provides these\nservices becomes bankrupt or insolvent, JPMorgan Chase\nmay incur losses, become involved in disputes and\nlitigation with one or more CCPs, the client’s\nbankruptcy estate and other creditors, or be subject\nto regulatory investigations. All of the foregoing\nevents can increase JPMorgan Chase’s operational and\nlitigation costs, and JPMorgan Chase may suffer losses\nto the extent that any collateral that it has received\nis insufficient to cover those losses. JPMorgan Chase\ncan also be subject to bearing its share of non-\ndefault losses incurred by a CCP, including losses\nfrom custodial, settlement or investment activities or\ndue to cyber or other security breaches.\nTransactions with government entities, including\nnational, state, provincial, municipal and local\nauthorities, can expose JPMorgan Chase to enhanced\nsovereign, credit, operational and reputation risks.\nGovernment entities may, among other things, claim\nthat actions taken by government officials were beyond\nthe legal authority of those officials or repudiate\ntransactions authorized by a previous incumbent\ngovernment. These types of actions have in the past\ncaused, and could in the future cause, JPMorgan Chase\nto suffer losses or hamper its ability to conduct\nbusiness in the relevant jurisdiction.\nIn addition, local laws, rules and regulations could\nlimit JPMorgan Chase’s ability to resolve disputes and\nlitigation in the event of a counterparty default or\nunwillingness to make previously agreed-upon payments,\nwhich could subject JPMorgan Chase to losses.\nDisputes may arise with counterparties to derivatives\ncontracts with regard to the terms, the settlement\nprocedures or the value of underlying collateral. The\ndisposition of those disputes could cause JPMorgan\nChase to incur unexpected transaction, operational and\nlegal costs, or result in credit losses. These\nconsequences can also impair JPMorgan Chase’s ability\nto effectively manage its credit risk exposure from\nits market activities, or cause harm to JPMorgan\nChase’s reputation.\nThe financial or operational failure of a significant\nmarket participant, such as a major financial\ninstitution or a CCP, or concerns about the\ncreditworthiness of such a market participant, can\nhave a cascading effect within the financial markets.\nJPMorgan Chase’s businesses could be significantly\ndisrupted by such an event, particularly if it leads\nto other market participants incurring significant\nlosses, experiencing liquidity issues or defaulting,\nand JPMorgan Chase is likely to have significant\ninterrelationships with, and credit exposure to, such\na significant market participant.\nJPMorgan Chase may suffer losses if the value of\ncollateral declines in stressed market conditions.\nDuring periods of market stress or illiquidity,\nJPMorgan Chase’s credit risk may be further increased\nwhen:\nJPMorgan Chase cannot realize the fair value of the\ncollateral it holds\ncollateral is liquidated at prices that are not\nsufficient to recover the full amount owed to it, or\ncounterparties are unable to post collateral,\nwhether for operational or other reasons.\nFurthermore, disputes with counterparties concerning\nthe valuation of collateral may increase in times of\nsignificant market stress, volatility or illiquidity,\nand JPMorgan Chase could suffer losses during these\nperiods if it is unable to realize the fair value of\ncollateral or to manage declines in the value of\ncollateral.\nJPMorgan Chase could incur significant losses arising\nfrom concentrations of credit and market risk.\nJPMorgan Chase is exposed to greater credit and market\nrisk to the extent that groupings of its clients or\ncounterparties:\nengage in similar or related businesses, or in\nbusinesses in related industries\ndo business in the same geographic region, or\nhave business profiles, models or strategies that\ncould cause their ability to meet their obligations to\nbe similarly affected by changes in economic\nconditions.\n17",
