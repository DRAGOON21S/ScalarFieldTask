JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $9.4 billion for
the third quarter of 2020, or $2.92 per share, on net
revenue of $29.1 billion. The Firm reported ROE of 15%
and ROTCE of 19%. The Firm's results for the third
quarter of 2020 included firmwide legal expense of
$524 million.

• The Firm had net income of $9.4 billion, up 4%.

• Total net revenue was flat. Net interest income was
$13.0 billion, down 9%, predominantly driven by the
impact of lower rates largely offset by higher net
interest income in CIB Markets as well as balance
sheet growth. Noninterest revenue was $16.1 billion,
up 7%, predominantly driven by higher Investment
Banking fees, Markets revenue, and Credit Adjustments
& Other in the CIB, and higher net investment
securities gains in Corporate.

• Noninterest expense was $16.9 billion, up 3%,
primarily driven by higher legal expense predominantly
in CIB and an impairment on a legacy investment in
Corporate, partially offset by lower marketing expense
in CCB.
                                                         5                                                         
• The provision for credit losses was $611 million,
down $903 million from the prior year. Net charge-offs
of $1.2 billion were down $191 million from the prior
year, predominantly driven by Card, which reflected
lower charge-offs and higher recoveries, and benefited
from the effect of payment assistance and government
stimulus programs. The current quarter included a net
reduction to the allowance for credit losses that was
largely driven by paydowns in the Home Lending
portfolio and changes in wholesale loan balances,
partially offset by an addition to the allowance for
the investment securities portfolio due to the
transfer of certain securities from available-for-sale
to held-to-maturity. The prior year included net
additions to the allowance for credit losses across
both the Consumer and Wholesale portfolios.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $33.8
billion at September 30, 2020. The Firm had an
allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage
ratio of 3.26%, compared with 3.27% in the second
quarter of 2020, and 1.42% in the prior year; the
increase from the prior year was driven by the
additions to the allowance for credit losses and the
adoption of CECL.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $11.5
billion at September 30, 2020, an increase of $1.7
billion from the second quarter of 2020, driven by
customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral
programs and were 90 or more days past due in Home
Lending in CCB, and downgrades in the wholesale
portfolio across multiple industries on client credit
deterioration. Nonperforming assets increased from
$6.0 billion in the prior year due to downgrades in
the wholesale portfolio, as well as from the adoption
of CECL, as the purchased credit deteriorated loans in
the mortgage portfolio became subject to nonaccrual
loan treatment.

• Firmwide average loans of $991 billion were up 1%,
largely reflecting higher loan balances in AWM, as
well as loans originated under the Small Business
Administration’s (“SBA”) Paycheck Protection Program
(“PPP”), offset by lower loan balances in Home Lending
and Card.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.0 trillion were up
30%, reflecting significant inflows across the Firm,
primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the
related effect of certain government actions.

• As of September 30, 2020 the Firm had average High
Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately $670
billion and unencumbered marketable securities with a
fair value of approximately $660 billion, resulting in
approximately $1.3 trillion of liquidity sources.

• The Firm’s CET1 capital was $198 billion, and the
Standardized and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.1% and
13.8%, respectively.

• The Firm’s SLR was 7.0%. The SLR reflects the
temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, as required by the
Federal Reserve’s interim final rule issued on April
1, 2020. The Firm’s SLR excluding the temporary relief
was 5.8%.

• The Firm grew TBVPS, ending the third quarter of
2020 at $63.93, up 6% versus the prior year.

ROTCE and TBVPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer

These current expectations are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form
10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on
page 92 and Risk Factors on page 201 of this Form 10-Q
a nd pages 6–28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for
a further discussion of certain of those risks and
uncertainties and the other factors that could cause
JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially
because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no
assurance that actual results will be in line with the
outlook set forth below, and the Firm does not
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for the remainder of
2020 and for 2021 should be viewed against the
backdrop of the global and U.S. economies, the
COVID-19 pandemic, financial markets activity, the
geopolitical environment, the competitive environment,
client and customer activity levels, and regulatory
and legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm and
its LOBs. The Firm will continue to make appropriate
adjustments to its businesses and operations in
response to ongoing developments in the business,
economic, regulatory and legal environments in which
it operates. The outlook information contained in this
Form 10-Q supersedes all outlook information furnished
by the Firm in its periodic reports filed with the SEC
prior to the date of this Form 10-Q.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has
implemented strategies and procedures designed to help
it respond to increased market volatility, client
demand for credit and liquidity, distress in certain
industries/sectors and the ongoing impacts to
consumers and businesses.

The Firm remains focused on serving its customers,
clients and communities, as well as the well-being of
its employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm
continues to actively monitor the dynamic health and
safety situations at local and regional levels, and
plans remain flexible to adapt as these situations
evolve.

Supporting clients and customers

Since March 2020 the Firm has provided assistance to
clients and customers primarily in the form of payment
deferrals on loans and auto leases.

Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 for
information on assistance granted to customers and
clients. Refer to Consumer Credit portfolio on pages
62-66 and Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 67-76
for information on retained loans under payment
deferral.

The Firm has gradually re-opened its branches since
April, with nearly 90% of its branches returning to
full service as of the third quarter of 2020.
Additionally, the Firm continues to make a wide range
of banking services accessible to clients and
customers through mobile and other digital channels.

Protecting and supporting employees

At the onset of the pandemic, the Firm implemented
alternative work arrangements, with the vast majority
of its global workforce working from home.

While the majority of the Firm’s employees globally
continue to work from home, the Firm continues to
return employees to the office.

Supporting communities

Since March, the Firm has committed $250 million to
help address humanitarian needs and long-term economic
challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on the
communities in which the Firm operates. As of
September 30, 2020 nearly half of this commitment has
been funded.
                                                                                                                   
  Departure of the U.K. from the EU                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
The Firm continues to execute on its Firmwide Brexit
Implementation program and remains focused on the
following key areas to ensure continuation of service
to its EU clients: regulatory and legal entity
readiness; client readiness; and business and
operational readiness.

The Firm is preparing for the possibility that the
U.K. will complete its departure from the EU without
having agreed the terms of their future relationship,
which is commonly referred to as “hard Brexit.” The
Firm is therefore preparing to finalize and implement
the various components of its Brexit readiness plan by
year-end, including completion of the relocation of
approximately 200 front office roles from the U.K. to
EU locations, and the migration of remaining EU
clients and certain positions to EU entities by the
end of the year. A key factor in that plan will be to
secure client engagement; any delays may impact the
Firm’s ability to continue servicing EU clients, as
the Firm’s U.K.-based legal entities are expected to
lose their ability to transact business from the U.K.
with EU clients at the end of the year.

The COVID-19 pandemic has introduced additional risk
to the Firm’s Brexit Implementation program. Infection
rates and travel restrictions are increasing and lock-
downs have been introduced across various U.K. and EU
locations. As a result, the risk that clients may not
be operationally ready and that the Firm may not be
able to relocate employees by year-end is rising.
Unless some official-sector solution is forthcoming,
the Firm’s ability to continue servicing EU clients
may be adversely affected.

On March 12, 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (“FASB”) issued an accounting standards update
providing optional expedients and exceptions for
applying generally accepted accounting principles to
contracts and hedge accounting relationships affected
by reference rate reform. These optional expedients
are intended to simplify the operational impact of
applying U.S. GAAP to transactions impacted by
reference rate reform. The Firm elected to apply
certain of these expedients beginning in the third
quarter of 2020. On August 27, 2020, the International
Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) issued guidance
that provides similar relief for entities reporting
under International Financial Reporting Standards
("IFRS"). Refer to Accounting and Reporting
Developments on page 91 for additional information.
The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief
being considered by the U.S. Treasury Department
regarding the tax implications of reference rate
reform.

The Firm also continues to develop and implement plans
to appropriately mitigate the risks associated with
IBOR discontinuation. Refer to Business Developments
on page 47 of the 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the Firm’s initiatives to address the expected
discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) and other IBORs.

Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19
Pandemic

Since March 2020, the U.S. government as well as
central banks and banking authorities around the world
have taken and continue to take actions to help
individuals, households and businesses that have been
adversely affected by the economic disruption caused
by the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act, which was
signed into law on March 27, 2020, provides, among
other things, funding to support loan facilities to
assist consumers and businesses. Set forth below is a
summary as of the date of this Form 10-Q of U.S.
government actions currently impacting the Firm and
U.S. government programs in which the Firm is
participating to support individuals, businesses, and
the broader economy. The Firm will continue to assess
ongoing developments in government actions in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Eligible retained income definition . On March 17,
2020, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
(“OCC”), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve
System (“Federal Reserve”), and the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), collectively the
“federal banking agencies,” issued an interim final
rule that revised the definition of “eligible retained
income” in the regulatory capital rules that apply to
all U.S. banking organizations. On March 23, 2020, the
Federal Reserve issued an interim final rule that
revised the definition of “eligible retained income”
for purposes of the total loss-absorbing capacity
(“TLAC”) buffer requirements that apply to global
systemically important banking organizations. The
revised definition of eligible retained income makes
any automatic limitations on payout distributions that
could apply under the agencies’ capital rules or TLAC
rule take effect on a more graduated basis in the
event that a banking organization’s capital, leverage
and TLAC ratios were to decline below regulatory
requirements (including buffers). The March 17, 2020
interim final rule was issued, in conjunction with an
interagency statement encouraging banking
organizations to use their capital and liquidity
buffers, to further support banking organizations’
abilities to lend to households and businesses
affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. On August 26, 2020,
the federal banking agencies issued the final rule
consistent with the interim final rules published on
March 17, 2020 and March 23, 2020.

Reserve requirements . On March 26, 2020, the Federal
Reserve reduced reserve requirement ratios to zero
percent, effectively eliminating the reserve
requirement for all depository institutions, an action
that freed up liquidity in the banking system to
support lending to households and businesses.

Refer to Note 21 for additional information on the
reduction to the reserve requirement.

Regulatory Capital - Current Expected Credit Losses
(“CECL”) transition delay. On March 31, 2020, the
federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule
(issued as final on

August 26, 2020) that provided banking organizations
with the option to delay the effects of CECL on
regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-
year transition period (“CECL capital transition
provisions”). The Firm elected to apply the CECL
capital transition provisions.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 and
Note 22 on pages 177–178 for additional information on
the CECL capital transition provisions and the impact
to the Firm’s capital metrics.

Supplementary leverage ratio (“SLR”) temporary
revision. On April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued
an interim final rule that requires, on a temporary
basis, the calculation of total leverage exposure for
purposes of calculating the SLR for bank holding
companies, to exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of
U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal
Reserve Banks. These exclusions became effective April
1, 2020, and will remain in effect through March 31,
2021.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 and
Note 22 for additional information on the Firm’s SLR.

Loan modifications. On April 7, 2020, the federal
banking agencies along with the National Credit Union
Administration, and the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau, in consultation with the state financial
regulators, issued an interagency statement revising a
March 22, 2020 interagency statement on loan
modifications and the reporting for financial
institutions working with customers affected by the
COVID-19 pandemic (the “IA Statement”). The IA
Statement reconfirmed that efforts to work with
borrowers where the loans are prudently underwritten,
and not considered past due or carried on nonaccrual
status, should not result in the loans automatically
being considered modified in a troubled debt
restructuring (“TDR”) for accounting and financial
reporting purposes, or for purposes of their
respective risk-based capital rules, which would
otherwise require financial institutions subject to
the capital rules to hold more capital. The IA
Statement also clarified the interaction between its
previous guidance and Section 4013 of the CARES Act,
which provides certain financial institutions with the
option to suspend the application of accounting
guidance for TDRs for a limited period of time for
loan modifications made to address the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant
modifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19
related loan modifications have not been considered
TDRs as:

• they represent short-term or other insignificant
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan
modification assessments or the IA Statement guidance,
or

• the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend
the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as
provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act.
                                                        11                                                         
To the extent that certain modifications do not meet
any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them
as TDRs. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 and
Note 12 for additional information on the Firm’s loan
modification activities.

U.S. government facilities and programs . Beginning in
March 2020, the Federal Reserve announced a suite of
facilities using its emergency lending powers under
section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to support
the flow of credit to individuals, households and
businesses adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
and to support the broader economy. In addition,
beginning April 3, 2020, the PPP, established by the
CARES Act and administered by the SBA, authorized
eligible lenders to provide nonrecourse loans to
eligible borrowers until August 8, 2020 to provide an
incentive for these businesses to keep their workers
on their payroll. The Firm has participated and is
participating in certain of these facilities and
programs, as needed, to assist its clients and
customers or to support the broader economy.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54,
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55–59 and Note 22
for additional information on the Firm’s participation
in these facilities. Refer to Capital Risk Management
on pages 49-54, Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 and
Note 22 for additional information on the Firm’s
participation in the PPP.

current presentation.

(b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from
marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c) Included operating lease income of $1.4 billion for each of the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019,
and $4.2 billion and $4.0 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB,
reflecting:

• higher equity underwriting fees primarily in follow-
on offerings and IPO markets due to increased
industry-wide fees

• higher debt underwriting fees due to wallet share
gains despite decreased industry-wide fees,

partially offset by

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower number of
completed transactions associated in part with the
lower level of announced deal volumes in the first
half of the year.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 31-37 and Note 6
for additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, primarily in
CIB, reflecting:

• higher revenue in both Fixed Income and Equity
Markets driven by strong performance in Commodities
and Credit, as well as Cash Equities, respectively,
and

• a $169 million gain in Credit Adjustments & Other
largely driven by funding and credit spread tightening
on derivatives, compared with a $71 million loss in
the prior year.

The increase in principal transactions revenue also
reflected net gains on certain legacy private equity
investments in Corporate.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain
cases have offsets across other revenue lines,
including net interest income. The Firm assesses its
CIB Markets business performance on a total revenue
basis.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages
31-37 and pages 46-47, and Note 6 for additional
information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees was relatively flat
as the lower deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting
lower transaction activity and the impact of fee
refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic , was offset
by higher cash management fees, as well as higher
lending-related fees, in particular, loan commitment
fees in CIB and CB. Refer to CCB segment results on
pages 26-30, CIB on pages 31-37 and CB on pages 38-41,
respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased, reflecting higher asset management
fees as a result of cumulative net inflows into
liquidity and long-term products in AWM.

For information on asset management, administration
and commissions revenue, refer to CCB, CIB and AWM
segment results on pages 26-30, pages 31-37 and pages
42-45, respectively, and Note 6.

Investment securities gains increased due to the
repositioning of the investment securities portfolio,
including sales of U.S. GSE and government agency
mortgage-backed securities.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 46-47 and
Note 10 for information on investment securities
gains.

Mortgage fees and related income increased due to:

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting

– higher MSR risk management results driven by updates
to model inputs, and

– higher operating revenue reflecting the absence of
losses in the prior year from reclassifying certain
loans to held-for-sale, predominantly offset by lower
revenue on a lower level of third-party loans serviced

• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting
higher production margins and volumes; the prior year
included approximately $350 million of gains on the
sale of certain loans.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, Note 6
and 15 for further information.

Card income decreased due to lower net interchange
income reflecting lower card sales volumes as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, largely offset by lower
acquisition costs and higher annual fees.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, and Note
6 for further information.

Other income decreased, reflecting:

• net losses related to derivatives in Other
Corporate, as well as the costs of hedging certain
non-U.S. dollar-denominated net investment exposures
in Treasury and CIO

• losses related to the early termination of certain
of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and CIO

• increased amortization on higher levels of
alternative energy investments in CIB. The increased
amortization was more than offset by lower income tax
expense from the associated tax credits.

Net interest income decreased due to the impact of
lower rates, largely offset by higher net interest
income in CIB Markets, as well as balance sheet
growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.9
trillion, up $510 billion, and the yield was 2.05%,
down 151 basis points ("bps"), primarily due to lower
rates. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis,
was 1.82%, a decrease of 59 bps. The net yield
excluding CIB Markets was 2.05%, down 118 bps.

Net yield excluding CIB Markets is a non-GAAP
financial measure. Refer to the Consolidated average
balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on pages

  Year-to-date results                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Investment banking fees increased, driven by CIB,
reflecting:

• higher equity underwriting fees primarily in follow-
on offerings and convertible securities markets due to
increased industry-wide fees

• higher debt underwriting fees due to increased
industry-wide fees and wallet share gains in
investment-grade and high-yield bonds. The increased
activity resulted in part from clients seeking
liquidity in the first half of the year as a result of
the COVID-19 pandemic,

partially offset by

• lower advisory fees driven by a lower number of
completed transactions.

Principal transactions revenue increased, primarily in
CIB, reflecting:

• higher revenue in both Fixed Income and Equity
Markets driven by strong performance in Rates,
Currencies & Emerging Markets, Credit and Commodities,
as well as in Cash Equities and equity derivatives,
respectively,

partially offset by

• a $272 million net loss in Credit Adjustments &
Other driven by losses on certain components of fair
value option elected liabilities, as well as the
impact of funding spread widening on derivatives.

The increase in principal transactions revenue also
reflected net gains on certain legacy private equity
investments in Corporate, compared with net losses in
the prior year.

Lending- and deposit-related fees was relatively flat
as the lower deposit-related fees in CCB, reflecting
lower transaction activity and the impact of fee
refunds related to the COVID-19 pandemic , was offset
by higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, as well
as higher lending-related fees, in particular, loan
commitment fees in CIB.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased driven by:

• higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of
cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term
products, and in CCB related to a higher level of
investment assets

• higher brokerage commissions in CIB and AWM on
higher client-driven volume,

partially offset by

• lower volume of annuity sales in CCB.
                                                        14                                                         
Investment securities gains increased due to the
repositioning of the investment securities portfolio,
including sales of U.S. GSE and government agency
mortgage-backed securities in the first and third
quarters of 2020.

Mortgage fees and related income increased due to:

• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting
higher mortgage production volumes and margins; the
prior year included gains on the sales of certain
loans

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting

– higher MSR risk management results; the prior year
included losses resulting from updates to model
inputs,

partially offset by

– lower operating revenue reflecting a lower level of
third-party loans serviced; the prior year included
losses from reclassifying certain loans to held-for-
sale.

Card income decreased due to lower net interchange
income reflecting lower card sales volumes that began
in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
partially offset by higher annual fees and lower
acquisition costs.

Other income decreased reflecting:

• net losses related to derivatives in Other
Corporate, as well as the costs of hedging certain
non-U.S. dollar-denominated net investment exposures
in Treasury and CIO

• net losses on certain equity investments in CIB,
compared with net gains in the prior year

• increased amortization on higher levels of
alternative energy investments in CIB. The increased
amortization is more than offset by lower income tax
expense from the associated tax credits

• lower net valuation gains on certain investments in
AWM

• losses related to the early termination of certain
of the Firm's long-term debt in Treasury and CIO,

partially offset by

• higher operating lease income from growth in auto
operating lease volume in CCB.

Refer to Note 17 for further information.

Net interest income decreased due to the impact of
lower rates, predominantly offset by higher net
interest income in CIB Markets, as well as balance
sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $2.7
trillion, up $386 billion, and the yield was 2.47%,
down 123 bps, primarily due to lower rates. The net
yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.04%, a
decrease of 45 bps. The net yield excluding CIB
Markets was 2.41%, down 93 bps.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL,
the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card
portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the
allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for
further information.
                                                                                                                   
  Quarterly results                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
The provision for credit losses decreased driven by
both the consumer and wholesale portfolios.

The decrease in consumer reflected:

• a $300 million reduction in the allowance for credit
losses in Home Lending due to paydowns; a $100 million
reduction in the allowance in the Business Banking
consumer portfolio, which was offset by an addition to
the allowance in the Business Banking wholesale
portfolio; resulting in no change to CBB’s overall
allowance for credit losses, and

• lower net charge-offs in Card, which reflected lower
charge-offs and higher recoveries, and benefited from
the effect of payment assistance and government
stimulus programs.

The prior year included a $138 million net addition to
the allowance for credit losses.

The wholesale provision was a net benefit as a result
of reductions in the allowance for credit losses
across CIB, CB and AWM, driven by changes in loan
balances, partially offset by an addition to the
allowance in CCB Business Banking as noted above. The
prior year provision was largely driven by select
Commercial & Industrial ("C&I") client downgrades.

The investment securities provision was predominantly
driven by the transfer of certain securities from
available-for-sale ("AFS") to held-to-maturity
("HTM").

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 26-30, CIB on
pages 31-37, CB on pages 38-41, AWM on pages 42-45,
the Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 77–78, and
Note 10 and 13 for additional information on the
credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.
                                                                                                                   
  Year-to-date results                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
The provision for credit losses increased primarily
driven by the deterioration and uncertainty in the
macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic in consumer and wholesale.

The increase in consumer reflected:

• net additions of $8.3 billion to the allowance for
credit losses, consisting of $6.6 billion for Card,
$900 million for Home Lending, $520 million for Auto,
and $252 million for Business Banking,

partially offset by

• lower net charge-offs largely in Card, which
reflected higher recoveries, and in Home Lending,
reflecting higher recoveries on a loan sale in the
first quarter of 2020.

The prior year included an $83 million net reduction
in the allowance for credit losses.

The increase in wholesale reflected a net addition of
$6.7 billion to the allowance for credit losses across
the LOBs impacting multiple industry sectors.

The investment securities provision was predominantly
driven by the transfer of certain securities from AFS
to HTM.

(a) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from
marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) Included Firmwide legal expense/(benefit) of $524 million and $10 million for the three months ended September
30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $839 million and $(2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and
2019, respectively.

(c) Included FDIC-related expense of $186 million and $114 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020
and 2019, respectively, and $503 million and $378 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

Compensation expense increased driven by investments
in new hires, predominantly offset by lower revenue-
related expense in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher legal expense predominantly in CIB

• an impairment on a legacy investment in Corporate

• higher volume-related expense, in particular
brokerage expense in CIB,

partially offset by

• lower marketing expense in CCB as a result of lower
investments in marketing campaigns and travel-related
benefits, and

• lower structural expense, including lower travel and
entertainment across the businesses.

Compensation expense increased driven by higher
revenue-related expense in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher legal expense predominantly in CIB and from a
lower net legal benefit in Corporate

• higher volume-related expense, in particular
brokerage expense in CIB and depreciation from growth
in auto lease assets in CCB

• an impairment on a legacy investment in Corporate,

partially offset by

• lower marketing expense in CCB as a result of lower
investments in marketing campaigns and travel-related
benefits, and

• lower structural expense, including lower travel and
entertainment across the businesses.

The effective tax rate decreased due to changes in the
level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S.
federal, and state and local taxes, as well as prior-
year adjustments. The decrease was partially offset by
the absence of tax benefits recorded in the prior year
related to the resolution of certain tax audits.

The effective tax rate decreased due to changes in the
level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S.
federal, and state and local taxes, as well as prior-
year adjustments and the more significant effect of
certain tax benefits on a lower level of pre-tax
income. The decrease was largely offset by the
recognition of $1.0 billion of tax benefits recorded
in the prior year related to the resolution of certain
tax audits.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm
reclassified certain fair value option elected
lending-related positions from trading assets to loans
and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
increased primarily as a result of significant deposit
inflows, which also funded asset growth across the
Firm, including in investment securities and
securities purchased under resale agreements. Deposits
with banks reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess
cash with various central banks, including the Federal
Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements increased predominantly as a result
of higher deployment of cash in Treasury and CIO, as
well as the impact of client activity and higher
demand for securities to cover short positions in CIB.
Refer to Liquidity Ri sk Management on pages 55–59 and
Note 11 for additional information.

Trading assets increased compared with lower levels at
year-end due to client-driven market-making activities
in debt and equity instruments in CIB Markets, as well
as higher derivative receivables as a result of market
movements, also in CIB. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for
additional information.

Investment securitie s increased, reflecting net
purchases of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS in the available-for-sale
(“AFS”) portfolio, driven by interest rate risk
management activities and cash deployment, partially
offset by a non-cash transfer of $100.5 billion of AFS
securities to the held-to-maturity (“HTM”) portfolio,
resulting in a comparable increase in HTM; the
transfer was made for capital management purposes.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 46-47,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 79, and

Notes 2 and 10 for additional information on
Investment securities.

Loans decreased, reflecting:

• lower loans in Card due to the decline in sales
volume that began in March as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic, as well as the impact of seasonality; and
lower loans in Home Lending primarily due to paydowns
and loan sales, net of originations,

partially offset by

• the impact of the PPP loans in CBB and CB, as well
as growth in wholesale loans and mortgages in AWM.

The allowance for loan losses increased primarily
reflecting the deterioration and uncertainty in the
macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of
the COVID-19 pandemic, consisting of:

• a net $8.3 billion addition in consumer,
predominantly in the credit card and residential real
estate portfolios

• a net $5.2 billion addition in wholesale, across the
LOBs impacting multiple industry sectors, and

• a net $4.2 billion addition as a result of the
adoption of CECL.

There were also additions to the allowance for
lending-related commitments, which is included in
other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets,
of $1.5 billion related to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, and $98 million related to the adoption of
CECL, resulting in total additions to the allowance
for credit losses of $15.0 billion and $4.3 billion,
respectively, as of September 30, 2020.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 60-79, and Notes 1, 2, 3, 12 and 13 for a more
detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for
loan losses.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles decreased
reflecting lower MSRs as a result of faster prepayment
speeds on lower rates and the realization of expected
cash flows, partially offset by net additions to the
MSRs. Refer to Note 15 for additional information.

Other assets increased reflecting higher cash
collateral placed with central counterparties in CIB.

additional information.

Deposits increased reflecting significant inflows
across the LOBs primarily driven by the COVID-19
pandemic and the related effect of certain government
actions

• in the wholesale businesses, the inflows principally
occurred in March as clients looked to remain liquid
as a result of market conditions; in general, balances
remained elevated through the third quarter, and

• in CCB, the increase was driven by lower spending
and higher cash balances across both consumer and
small business customers, as well as growth from
existing and new accounts.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55–59 and
Notes 2 and 16 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

• in CIB, higher secured financing of trading assets,
partially offset by a decline in client-driven market-
making activities, and the Firm's nonparticipation in
the Federal Reserve's open market operations, and

• in Treasury and CIO, higher secured financing of AFS
investment securities. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 55–59 and Note 11 for additional
information.

For information on short-term borrowings, refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 55–59 .

Trading liabilities increased as a result of client-
driven market-making activities in CIB, which resulted
in higher levels of short positions predominantly in
debt instruments in Fixed Income Markets, as well as
higher derivative payables as a result of market
movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional
information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased
reflecting higher client payables related to client-
driven activities in CIB.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
increased primarily reflecting higher levels of Firm-
administered multi-seller conduit commercial paper
held by third parties.

Refer to Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements on page 21 and
Notes 14 and 23 for further information on Firm-
sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt decreased as a result of maturities of
FHLB advances; net maturities of senior debt, which
included the early termination of certain of the
Firm's debt; partially offset by an issuance of
subordinated debt, and higher fair value hedge
accounting adjustments related to lower interest
rates. The decrease was also due to a lower level of
structured notes in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 55–59 for additional information
on the Firm’s long-term debt activities.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting the combined
impact of net income, capital actions, the adoption of
CECL and an increase in accumulated other
comprehensive income (“AOCI”). The increase in AOCI
was driven by net unrealized gains on AFS securities,
and higher valuation of interest rate cash flow
hedges. Refer to page 96 for information on changes in
stockholders’ equity, Capital actions on page 53, and
Note 20 for additional information on AOCI.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation. Operating activities • In 2020, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and other assets,
partially offset by higher trading liabilities, accounts payable and other liabilities, and net proceeds from loans
held for sale. • In 2019, cash used primarily resulted from higher trading assets and securities borrowed,
partially offset by increased accounts payable and other liabilities, trading liabilities, and net proceeds from
loans held-for-sale.

Investing activities • In 2020, cash used reflected net purchases of investment securities and higher securities
purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-
for-investment. • In 2019, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment securities, partially offset by
higher securities purchased under resale agreements, and net proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-
for-investment. Financing activities • In 2020, cash provided reflected higher deposits and securities loaned or
sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by net payments of long term borrowings. • In 2019, cash
provided resulted from higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements. • For both
periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. On March
15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common equity.
Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large bank holding companies, including the Firm, to discontinue net
share repurchases through the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets

  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
                                  
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual
obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while
others are disclosed as off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).
                                                                                                                   
  Special-purpose entities                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose
entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments
and guarantees).

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as
derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that
transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing.

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q a discussion of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet
arrangements can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 93-97.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis)

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense

• Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB
Markets

• Tangible common equity (“TCE”), ROTCE, and TBVPS

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 57–59 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

The following summary tables provide a reconciliation
from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed
basis.

  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
                            
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four
major reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In
addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 22-23 for a definition of managed
basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm’s LOBs also
provide various business metrics which are utilized by
the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing
performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products
and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating
business segments may agree to share revenue from
those transactions. Revenue and expense are generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related
product or service, with allocations to the other
segment(s)

involved in the transaction. The segment results
reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Business segment capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business is
referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions
and methodologies used to allocate capital are
assessed and as a result, the capital allocated to the
LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on
page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for
additional information on business segment capital
allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 60–61
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of those methodologies.

Business segment changes

In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting
a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB
following a realignment of the Firm’s wholesale
payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments business
comprises:

• Merchant Services, which was realigned from CCB to
CIB

• Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade
Finance was previously reported in Lending in CIB.

In connection with the alignment of Wholesale
Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount
associated with the Merchant Services business were
realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and
expenses of the Merchant Services business are
reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on
client relationships. Prior-period amounts have been

Wholesale Payments business. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and
commissions to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation.

(b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from
marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $1.0 billion for both of the three months ended September 30,
2020 and 2019, and $3.2 billion and $2.9 billion for nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(d) Included MSR risk management results of $145 million and $53 million for the three months ended September 30,
2020 and 2019, respectively, and $134 million and $(200) million for nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019,
respectively.

Net income was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 9%.

Net revenue was $12.8 billion, a decrease of 9%.

Net interest income was $8.0 billion, down 13%, driven
by:

• the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB and
lower loans in Card due to the decline in sales volume
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,

largely offset by

• growth in deposits in CBB, and loan margin expansion
in Card; the prior year included a charge for the
unwind of the internal funding from Treasury and CIO
associated with the sale of certain mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue was $4.8 billion, flat,
reflecting:

• lower deposit-related fees due to lower transaction
activity and the impact of fee refunds related to the
COVID-19 pandemic, and

• lower card income due to lower net interchange
income reflecting lower card sales volumes as a result
of the COVID-19 pandemic, offset by lower acquisition
costs and higher annual fees,

offset by

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting:

– higher MSR risk management results driven by updates
to model inputs, and

– higher operating revenue reflecting the absence of
losses in the prior year from reclassifying certain
loans to held-for-sale, predominantly offset by lower
revenue on a lower level of third-party loans serviced

• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting
higher production margins and volumes; the prior year
included approximately $350 million of gains on the
sale of certain mortgage loans.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding
changes in the value of the MSR asset and related
hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $6.8 billion, down 4%, driven
by lower marketing expense as a result of lower
investments in marketing campaigns and travel-related
benefits.

The provision for credit losses was $794 million, a
decrease of $517 million from the prior year, driven
by:

• a $300 million reduction in the allowance for credit
losses in Home Lending due to paydowns, and

• lower net charge-offs in Card, which reflected lower
charge-offs and higher recoveries, and benefited from
the effect of payment assistance and government
stimulus programs.

The prior year included a $50 million net addition in
the allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 60-79 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
77–78 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

Net income was $3.9 billion, a decrease of 69%,
predominantly driven by an increase in the provision
for credit losses.

Net revenue was $38.1 billion, a decrease of 7%.

Net interest income was $25.3 billion, down 10%,
driven by:

• the impact of deposit margin compression in CBB, and
lower loans in Home Lending predominantly due to prior
year loan sales,

partially offset by

• growth in deposits in CBB, and loan margin expansion
in Card; the prior year included charges for the
unwind of the internal funding from Treasury and CIO
associated with the sales of certain mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue was $12.8 billion, flat,
reflecting:

• lower deposit-related fees due to lower transaction
activity and the impact of fee refunds related to the
COVID-19 pandemic, and

• lower card income due to lower net interchange
income reflecting lower card sales volumes that began
in March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,
partially offset by higher annual fees and lower
acquisition costs,

offset by

• higher net mortgage production revenue reflecting
higher mortgage production volumes and margins; the
prior year included gains on the sales of certain
mortgage loans

• higher net mortgage servicing revenue driven by

– higher MSR risk management results; the prior year
included losses resulting from updates to model
inputs,

partially offset by

– lower operating revenue reflecting a lower level of
third-party loans serviced; the prior year included
losses from reclassifying certain loans to held-for-
sale

• higher auto lease volume.

Noninterest expense was $20.5 billion, down 1%,
compared to the prior year, reflecting:

• lower marketing expense as a result of lower
investments in marketing campaigns and travel-related
benefits, and

• lower structural expenses, including lower payment
processing costs,

largely offset by

• higher volume- and revenue-related expense,
including depreciation on auto lease assets, and
investments in the business.

The provision for credit losses was $12.4 billion, an
increase of $8.6 billion from the prior year, driven
by:

• additions to the allowance for credit losses as a
result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
consisting of: $6.6 billion for Card, $900 million for
Home Lending, $649 million for CBB, and $560 million
for Auto,

partially offset by

• lower net charge-offs largely in Card, which
reflected higher recoveries, and in Home Lending,
reflecting higher recoveries on a loan sale in the
first quarter of 2020.

The prior year included a $150 million net reduction
in the allowance for credit losses.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption resulted in a change in the
accounting for PCI loans, which are considered purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Refer to
Note 1 for further information.

(a) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL,
nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the
pools was performing.

(b) At September 30, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $851 million and $1.6 billion, respectively. Prior-period amount has been revised to
conform with the current presentation, refer to footnote (c) below for additional information. These amounts have
been excluded based upon the government guarantee.

(c) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d) At September 30, 2020, the 30+ day delinquency rates included PCD loans. The rate prior to January 1, 2020 was
revised to include the impact of PCI loans.

(e) At September 30, 2020 and 2019, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.1 billion and
$2.7 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with
the current presentation, refer to footnote (c) above for additional information. These amounts have been excluded
based upon the government guarantee.

(f) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity. Includes
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due,
predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(g) At September 30, 2020, included $20.3 billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. Given that PPP loans
are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. Refer to
Credit Portfolio on pages 60-61 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(h) At September 30, 2020, the principal balance of loans in Home Lending, Card and Auto under payment deferral
programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were $10.2 billion, $368 million and $411 million,
respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent.
Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 for further information on consumer payment assistance activity.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as part of the Firm’s
Wholesale Payments business. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) Includes credit valuation adjustments (“CVA”) managed centrally within CIB and funding valuation adjustments
(“FVA”) on derivatives and certain components of fair value option elected liabilities, which are primarily
reported in principal transactions revenue. Results are presented net of associated hedging activities and net of
CVA and FVA amounts allocated to Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.

Net income was $4.3 billion, up 52%.

Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 21%.

Banking revenue was $3.7 billion, up 6%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $2.1 billion, up 12%,
predominantly driven by higher Investment Banking
fees, up 9%, reflecting higher equity and debt
underwriting fees, partially offset by lower advisory
fees. The Firm maintained its #1 ranking for Global
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Equity underwriting fees were $732 million, up 42%,
primarily in the follow-on offerings and IPO markets
due to increased industry-wide fees.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, up 5%,
driven by wallet share gains despite decreased
industry-wide fees.

– Advisory fees were $428 million, down 15%, driven by
a lower number of completed transactions associated in
part with the lower level of announced deal volumes in
the first half of the year.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.3 billion, down
5%, predominantly driven by deposit margin compression
and a reporting reclassification for certain expenses
which are now reported as a reduction of revenue in
Merchant Services, largely offset by the impact of
higher deposit balances.

• Lending revenue was $333 million, up 32%,
predominantly driven by higher net interest income
reflecting overall spread widening and higher loan
balances.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $7.8
billion, up 29%. Markets revenue was $6.6 billion, up
30%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $4.6 billion, up
29%, driven by strong performance across products,
primarily in Commodities, Credit, and Securitized
Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.0 billion, up 32%,
driven by strong performance across products.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.0 billion, flat
compared to the prior year, as deposit margin
compression was offset by balance growth.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $169
million, largely driven by funding and credit spread
tightening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $5.8 billion, up 5%,
predominantly driven by higher legal expense and
volume-related expense, largely offset by lower
revenue-related compensation expense and structural
expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$81 million, driven by a reduction in the allowance
for credit losses across multiple sectors, compared
with an expense of $92 million in the prior year.

Net income was $11.8 billion, up 30%.

Net revenue was $37.8 billion, up 29%.

Banking revenue was $11.3 billion, up 10%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $6.4 billion, up 18%,
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 22%,
reflecting higher equity and debt underwriting fees,
partially offset by lower advisory fees. The Firm
maintained its #1 ranking for Global Investment
Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Equity underwriting fees were $2.0 billion, up 59%,
primarily in follow-on offerings and convertible
securities markets due to increased industry-wide
fees.

– Debt underwriting fees were $3.3 billion, up 23%,
driven by increased industry-wide fees and wallet
share gains in investment-grade and high-yield bonds.
The increased activity resulted in part from clients

– Advisory fees of $1.5 billion were down 8%, driven
by a lower number of completed transactions.

• Wholesale payments revenue was $4.0 billion, down
4%, predominantly driven by a reporting
reclassification for certain expenses which are now
reported as a reduction of revenue in Merchant
Services. In addition, the impact of deposit margin
compression was predominantly offset by higher deposit
balances.

• Lending revenue was $953 million, up 24%,
predominantly driven by higher net interest income
reflecting overall spread widening and higher loan
balances.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $26.5
billion, up 39%. Markets revenue was $23.5 billion, up
48%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $16.9 billion, up
54%, driven by strong client activity across products
primarily in Rates, Credit, Currencies & Emerging
Markets, and Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $6.6 billion, up 33%,
driven by strong client activity across products.

• Securities Services revenue was $3.2 billion, up 3%,
predominantly driven by deposit balance and fee growth
largely offset by deposit margin compression.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a net loss of $272
million, driven by losses on certain components of
fair value option elected liabilities, as well as the
impact of funding spread widening on derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $18.5 billion, up 10%,
predominantly driven by higher revenue-related
compensation expense and legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion,
compared with $179 million in the prior year. The
increase was driven by net additions to the allowance
for credit losses as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic across multiple industry sectors.

(a) Allowance for loan losses of $320 million and $207 million were held against these nonaccrual loans at
September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(c) At September 30, 2020 and 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $297 million and $116 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee.

(d) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate.

(e) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, a
non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

The following table summarizes select income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets
revenue comprises principal transactions, fees,
commissions and other income, as well as net interest
income. The Firm assesses its Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may
occur across revenue line items. For example,
securities that generate net interest income may be
risk-managed by derivatives that are

recorded in principal transactions revenue. Refer to
Notes 6 and 7 for a description of the composition of
these income statement line items. Refer to Markets
revenue on page 69 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K
for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant
source of principal transactions revenue was the
amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

CIB Markets had no loss days in the third quarter of 2020 and three loss days for the nine months ended September
30, 2020. Loss days represent the number of days for which CIB Markets, which consists of Fixed Income Markets and
Equity Markets, posted losses to total net revenue. The loss days determined under this measure differ from the
measure used to determine backtesting gains and losses. Daily backtesting gains and losses include positions in the
Firm’s Risk Management value-at-risk (“VaR”) measure and exclude select components of total net revenue, which may
more than offset backtesting gains or losses on a particular day. For more information on daily backtesting gains
and losses, refer to the VaR discussion on pages 80–82.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB and the revenue and
expense of the business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationship. In conjunction
with this realignment, treasury services product revenue has been renamed wholesale payments. Prior-period revenue
and expense amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fees from asset management, administration and
commissions (which are included in all other income) to lending- and deposit-related fees. Prior-period amounts
have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) Total net revenue included tax-equivalent adjustments from income tax credits related to equity investments in
designated community development entities and in entities established for rehabilitation of historic properties, as
well as tax-exempt income related to municipal financing activities of $82 million and $114 million for the three
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $243 million and $308 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Net income was $1.1 billion, up 15%.

Net revenue was $2.3 billion, flat compared to the
prior year. Net interest income was $1.5 billion, down
5%, driven by deposit margin compression,
predominantly offset by higher deposit balances and
lending revenue. Noninterest revenue was $761 million,
up 14%, driven by higher deposit related fees and
investment banking income.

Noninterest expense was $966 million, up 3%, driven by
higher compensation expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$147 million, driven by net reductions in the
allowance for credit losses across multiple sectors,
compared with an expense of $67 million in the prior
year.

Net income was $544 million, down 82%, driven by an
increase in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $6.9 billion, down 2%. Net interest
income was $4.7 billion, down 6%, driven by deposit
margin compression, largely offset by higher deposit
balances and lending revenue. Noninterest revenue was
$2.2 billion, up 9%, driven by higher deposit related
fees and a gain on a strategic investment. The
increase was partially offset by lower card income
primarily due to lower volumes as a result of the
COVID-19 pandemic and a $57 million markdown of a
held-for-sale position.

Noninterest expense was $2.9 billion, up 2%, driven by
higher compensation expense.

The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion,
compared with $186 million in the prior year. The
increase was driven by net additions to the allowance
for credit losses as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic across multiple industry sectors.

In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB and the revenue and
expense of the business is reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationship. In conjunction
with this realignment, treasury services product revenue has been renamed wholesale payments. Prior-period revenue
and expense amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) Includes CB’s share of revenue from investment banking products sold to CB clients through the CIB.

(b) Refer to Business Segment Results on page 24 for discussion of revenue sharing.

Net income was $877 million, up 31%.

Net revenue was $3.7 billion, up 5%. Net interest
income of $850 million was relatively flat, as deposit
margin compression was predominantly offset by growth
in average deposit and loan balances. Noninterest
revenue was $2.9 billion, up 6%, predominantly driven
by higher asset management fees due to strong
cumulative net inflows into liquidity and long-term
products and increased brokerage commissions on higher
client-driven volume.

Revenue from Asset Management was $1.9 billion, up 6%,
predominantly driven by asset management fees due to
strong cumulative net inflows into liquidity products.

Revenue from Wealth Management was $1.8 billion, up
3%, predominantly driven by higher deposit and loan
balances, increased brokerage commissions on higher
client-driven volume, and higher asset management fees
due to cumulative net inflows across all products,
largely offset by deposit margin compression.

Noninterest expense of $2.6 billion was flat.

The provision for credit losses was a benefit of $51
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for
credit losses.

pages 60-79 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
77–78 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

Net income was $2.2 billion, an increase of 7%.

Net revenue was $11.0 billion, an increase of 3%. Net
interest income of $2.6 billion, was flat reflecting
higher deposit and loan balances, offset by deposit
margin compression. Noninterest revenue was $8.3
billion, up 4%, predominantly driven by higher asset
management fees as a result of cumulative net inflows
into liquidity and long-term products as well as
increased brokerage commissions on higher client-
driven volume, partially offset by net valuation
losses on certain investments, compared with gains in
the prior year.

Revenue from Asset Management was $5.4 billion, up 2%,
driven by higher asset management fees as a result of
cumulative net inflows into liquidity products,
largely offset by lower investment valuation gains.

Revenue from Wealth Management was $5.5 billion, up
5%, predominantly driven by higher deposit and loan
balances as well as increased brokerage commissions on
higher client-driven volume and higher asset
management fees, largely offset by deposit margin
compression.

Noninterest expense was $7.8 billion, a decrease of
1%, driven by lower structural expense, predominantly
offset by higher investments, legal expense and
volume- and revenue-related expense.

The provision for credit losses was $266 million,
driven by additions to the allowance for credit losses
predominantly as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic.

Net loss was $699 million compared with net income of
$393 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $339 million, down $1.0
billion, driven by lower net interest income, largely
on lower rates, including the impact of faster
prepayments on mortgage-backed securities. The prior
year included income related to the unwind of the
internal funding provided to CCB upon the sale of
certain mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue increased, reflecting:

• higher investment securities gains due to the
repositioning of the investment securities portfolio,
including sales of U.S. GSE and government agency
mortgage-backed securities, and

• net gains on certain legacy private equity
investments,

largely offset by

• net losses related to derivatives in Other
Corporate, as well as the costs of hedging certain
non-U.S. dollar-denominated net investment exposures
in Treasury and CIO, and

• losses related to the early termination of certain
of the Firm’s long-term debt in Treasury and CIO.

Noninterest expense of $719 million was up $438
million predominantly driven by an impairment on a
legacy investment.

The provision for credit losses was predominantly
driven by the transfer of certain securities from AFS
to HTM.

Refer to Note 10 and Note 13 for additional
information on the investment securities portfolio and
the allowance for credit losses .

The current period income tax benefit was driven by
the change in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal, and state and local taxes as
well as the impact of the Firm’s estimated full-year
expected tax rate relative to the level of year-to-
date pretax income. The prior period included tax
benefits related to the resolution of certain tax
audits.

Net loss was $1.4 billion compared with net income of
$1.5 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $927 million, compared with
income of $1.4 billion in the prior year driven by
lower net interest income on lower rates. The prior
year included income related to the unwind of the
internal funding provided to CCB upon the sale of
certain mortgage loans.

Noninterest revenue increased primarily due to

• higher net investment securities gains due to the
repositioning of the investment securities portfolio,
including sales of U.S. GSE and government agency
mortgage-backed securities in the first and third
quarters of 2020, and

• net gains on certain legacy private equity
investments, compared with net losses in the prior
year,

largely offset by

• net losses related to derivatives in Other
Corporate, as well as the costs of hedging certain
non-U.S. dollar-denominated net investment exposures
in Treasury and CIO, and

• losses related to the early termination of certain
of the Firm’s long-term debt in Treasury and CIO.

Noninterest expense of $1.0 billion was up $288
million driven by an impairment on a legacy
investment, and a lower net legal benefit, partially
offset by lower structural expense.

The provision for credit losses was predominantly
driven by the transfer of certain securities from AFS
to HTM.

The current period income tax benefit was
predominantly driven by the change in the level and
mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal,
and state and local taxes. The prior period included
tax benefits of $957 million related to the resolution
of certain tax audits.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in
a manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors and protects the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risk issues, by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • Firmwide
structures for risk governance. The Firm strives for
continual improvement in its efforts to enhance
controls, ongoing employee training and development,
talent retention, and other measures. The Firm follows
a disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance and oversight
framework The Firm’s risk management governance and
oversight framework involves understanding drivers of
risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. Refer to
pages 79-83 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of Firmwide risk management
governance and oversight.

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient
level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s
business activities and associated risks during normal
economic environments and under stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 85–92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form

10-K, Note 22 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar
3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s Capital Risk Management,
including capital planning and stress testing.

COVID-19 Pandemic

The Firm has been impacted by recent market events as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, but remains well-
capitalized. However, the continuation or further
deterioration of the current macroeconomic environment
could result in impacts to the Firm’s capital and
leverage.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. bank holding
companies (“BHC”) and banks, including the Firm and
its insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held
by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-
weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted
according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-
based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm
is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches.

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios
are currently more binding than the Basel III
Advanced-risk-based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to
calculate the SLR. Refer to SLR on page 90 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments

Current Expected Credit Losses. As disclosed in the
Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, the Firm initially elected to
phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption
impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1
capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As
part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, on March 31, 2020, the federal banking
agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final
on August 26, 2020) that provided the option to delay
the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two
years, followed by a three-year transition period
(“CECL capital transition provisions”).

The final rule provides a uniform approach for
estimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy
incurred loss model during the first two years of the
transition period (the “day 2” transition amount),
whereby the Firm may exclude from CET1 capital 25% of
the change in the allowance for credit losses
(excluding allowances on PCD loans). The cumulative
day 2 transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that
is not recognized in CET1 capital as well as the $2.7
billion day 1 impact, will be phased into CET1 capital
at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. The Firm
has elected to apply the CECL capital transition
provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended
September 30, 2020, the capital metrics of the Firm
exclude $6.4 billion, which is the $2.7 billion day 1
impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $15.2
billion increase in the allowance for credit losses
(excluding allowances on PCD loans).

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions
on Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total
leverage exposure have also been incorporated into the
Firm’s capital metrics. Refer to Note 1 for further
information on the CECL accounting guidance.

Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility ("MMLF") .
On March 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve established the
MMLF facility, authorized through September 30, 2020,
to enhance the liquidity and functioning of money
markets. On July 28, 2020, the Federal Reserve
announced that it was extending the MMLF through
December 31, 2020. Under the MMLF, the FRBB makes
nonrecourse advances to participating financial
institutions to purchase certain types of assets from
eligible money market mutual fund clients. These
assets, which are reflected in other assets on the
Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets, are pledged to the
FRBB as collateral. On March 23, 2020, the federal
banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued
as final on September 29, 2020) to neutralize the
effects of purchasing assets through the program on
risk-based and leverage-based capital ratios. As of
September 30, 2020, the Firm excluded assets purchased
from money market mutual fund clients pursuant to
nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF in the
amount of $932 million from its RWA and $2.2 billion
from adjusted average assets and total leverage
exposure.

Supplementary leverage ratio temporary revision. On
April 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve issued an interim
final rule that requires, on a temporary basis, the
calculation of total leverage exposure for purposes of
calculating the SLR for bank holding companies, to
exclude the on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury
securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks.
These exclusions became effective April 1, 2020, and
will remain in effect through March 31, 2021.

On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC
issued an interim final rule that provides IDI
subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary
exclusion subject to certain
                                                        49                                                         
restrictions. As of September 30, 2020, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. has not elected to apply this exclusion.

Paycheck Protection Program. On April 13, 2020, the
federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule
(issued as final on September 29, 2020) to neutralize
the regulatory capital effects of participating in the
PPP on risk-based capital ratios by applying a zero
percent risk weight to loans originated under the
program. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the
SBA, the Firm does not expect to realize material
credit losses on these loans. As of September 30,
2020, the Firm had approximately $28 billion of loans
under the program.

The rule also provides that if the PPP loan is pledged
as collateral for a non-recourse loan under the
Federal Reserve’s Paycheck Protection Program Lending
(“PPPL”) Facility, the PPP loans can be excluded from
leverage-based capital ratios. As of September 30,
2020, the Firm had not participated in the PPPL
Facility.

COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 for additional
information on regulatory actions and significant
financing programs that the U.S. government and
regulators have introduced to address the effects of
the COVID-19 pandemic.

Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB"). On March 4, 2020, the
Federal Reserve issued the final rule introducing the
SCB framework

for the Basel III Standardized approach that is
designed to more closely integrate the results of the
quantitative assessment in the annual CCAR with the
ongoing minimum capital requirements for BHCs under
the U.S. Basel III rules. The final rule replaces the
static 2.5% CET1 capital conservation buffer in the
Standardized approach with a dynamic institution-
specific SCB. The final rule does not apply to the
Advanced approach capital requirements. The SCB
requirement for BHCs will be effective on October 1 of
each year and is expected to remain in effect until
September 30 of the following year.

TLAC Holdings rule . On October 20, 2020, the federal
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of TLAC debt
instruments by certain large banking organizations,
such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This
rule expands the scope of the existing capital
deductions rule around the holdings of capital
instruments of financial institutions to also include
TLAC debt instruments issued by systemically important
banking organizations. The rule is intended to limit
interconnectedness within the financial system and
reduce systemic risk. The final rule will become
effective on April 1, 2021.

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based and
leverage-based capital metrics under both the Basel
III Standardized and Advanced Approaches. Refer to
Capital Risk Management on pages 85–92 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
these capital metrics.

Capital planning and stress testing Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review On June 29, 2020, the Firm
announced that it had completed the 2020 CCAR stress
test process. On August 10, 2020, the Federal Reserve
affirmed the Firm's SCB requirement of 3.3% and the
Firm's minimum Standardized CET1 capital ratio of
11.3% (up from 10.5%). The SCB requirement became
effective on October 1, 2020. The Federal Reserve has
determined that changes in financial markets or the
macroeconomic outlook due to the COVID-19 pandemic
could have a material effect on a firm’s risk profile
and financial condition and therefore is requiring all
large bank holding companies, including the Firm, to
update and resubmit their capital plans by November 2,
2020. The Firm anticipates that the Federal Reserve
will disclose firm-specific results under the
additional scenarios before December 31, 2020. Refer
to Key Regulatory Developments on pages 49-50 of this
Form 10-Q and capital planning and stress testing on
pages 85-86 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for
additional information.

the Board of Directors’ approval on a quarterly basis.
Common equity On March 15, 2020, in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended
repurchases of its common equity. In June 2020, the
Federal Reserve directed all large bank holding
companies, including the Firm, to discontinue net
share repurchases, at least through the end of the
third quarter of 2020. As such, there were no shares
repurchased during the second and third quarters of
2020. On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve
directed all large bank holding companies, including
the Firm, to extend the discontinuation of net share
repurchases through the end of the fourth quarter of
2020. The following table sets forth the Firm’s
repurchases of common equity for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its contractual and contingent
financial obligations as they arise or that it does
not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor
of funding and liquidity to support its assets and
liabilities. Refer to pages 93–98 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2019 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website for
a further discussion of the Firm’s Liquidity Risk
Management. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires that
the Firm maintain an amount of unencumbered HQLA that
is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in
excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR
requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank
affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
HQLA. The LCR is required to be a minimum of 100%.
Refer to page 94 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K
and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for
additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.
The following table summarizes the Firm’s average LCR
for the three months ended September 30, 2020, June

assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess HQLA at
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR decreased during
the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared with the three-month period ended June 30, 2020, due to an
increase in net cash outflows largely due to market activities in the CIB. Liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
increased during the quarter primarily due to growth in deposits and a reduction in loans. Deposits continued to
increase in the third quarter primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effect of certain
government actions. However, these increases in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. are excluded from the
Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR rule.

The Firm's average LCR was negatively impacted during the three months ended September 30, 2020, compared with the
prior year period due to a significant increase in deposits impacting both HQLA and net cash outflows. However, the
average net excess HQLA has increased during the same period, primarily due to an increase in cash from unsecured
long-term debt issuances. The Firm’s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its HQLA and
estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources In addition to the
assets reported in the Firm’s HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity
securities and fixed income debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This
includes securities included as part of the excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to
non-bank affiliates, as described above. The fair value of these securities was approximately $660 billion and $315
billion as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could
be raised would be dependent on prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31,
2019, due to an increase in excess HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of increased
deposits as noted above. The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at FHLBs and the discount window at the
Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of approximately $295 billion and
$322 billion as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the
benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s HQLA or other unencumbered securities that are currently
pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central banks. Available borrowing capacity decreased
from December 31, 2019 primarily due to lower credit card receivable balances driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and a
decrease in pledged mortgage collateral as a result of paydown and maturity activity. Although available, the Firm
does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and the other central banks as a
primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity requirement for large
banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and “required” amounts of stable
funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued a final NSFR rule under
which large banking organizations such as the Firm will be required to maintain an NSFR of at least 100% on an
ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule will become effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be required to publicly
disclose its quarterly average NSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also
access funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-
term debt, or from borrowings from the

Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are
primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings
and short-term secured borrowings, primarily
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.
Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in
cash or other short-term liquid investments based on
their interest rate and liquidity risk
characteristics.

(a) In the first quarter of 2020, the Merchant
Services business was realigned from CCB to CIB as
part of the Firm’s Wholesale Payments business. The
prior- period amounts were revised to conform with the
current presentation.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce
the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets.
A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are
consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits,
which are both considered to be stable sources of
liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm. The table below
shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-
deposits ratios, and deposits as a percentage of total
liabilities, as of September 30, 2020 and December 31,
2019.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end
deposit balances, over time. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, reflecting significant inflows
across the LOBs primarily driven by the COVID-19 pandemic and the related effect of certain government actions. In
the wholesale businesses, the inflows principally occurred in March as clients looked to remain liquid as a result
of market conditions; in general, balances remained elevated through the third quarter. In CCB, the increase was
driven by lower spending and higher cash balances across both consumer and small business customers, as well as
growth from existing and new accounts. Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s Business Segment Results and the
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 24-47 and pages 18-19, respectively, for further information on
deposit and liability balance trends.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at September 30,
2020, compared with December 31, 2019, reflecting in
CIB, higher secured financing of trading assets,
partially offset by a decline in client-driven market-
making activities, and the Firm's nonparticipation in
the Federal Reserve's open market operations, and in
Treasury and CIO, higher secured financing of AFS
investment securities.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to customers’ investment and financing activities, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

As of September 30, 2020, the Firm participated in the
MMLF government facility. The secured nonrecourse
advances under the MMLF are included in other borrowed

funds. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54
for additional information on the MMLF.

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility ("PDCF") was
established by the Federal Reserve on March 20, 2020.
Under the PDCF, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York
(“FRBNY”) provides collateralized financing on a term
basis to primary dealers. These financing transactions
were reported as securities sold under agreements to
repurchase. The Firm participated in the PDCF in the
first quarter of 2020, and ceased its participation in
May 2020 as the secured financing market normalized.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
consist of other borrowed funds and issuance of
wholesale commercial paper. The decrease in commercial
paper at September 30, 2020, from December 31, 2019
and for the average three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020 compared to the prior year period,
was due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term
liquidity management. The increase in other borrowed
funds at September 30, 2020 from December 31, 2019 is
primarily driven by an increase in financing
activities in CIB Equity Markets.
                                                        57                                                         
                                                                                                                   
  Long-term funding and issuance                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Long-term funding provides additional sources of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory
requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market
access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating
its optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of both bank and non-bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external
counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 93–98 and Note
20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

(a) Includes long-term structured notes which are
secured.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans
for client-driven transactions; those client-driven
loan securitizations are not considered to be a source
of funding for the Firm and are not included in the
table above. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019
Form 10-K for further description of the client-driven
loan securitizations.

  Credit ratings                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs
on page 21, and liquidity risk and credit-related
contingent features in Note 5 for additional
information on the impact of a credit ratings
downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on
derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2020 were as follows:

(a) On April 18, 2020, Fitch affirmed the credit ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and
non-bank subsidiaries but revised the outlook on the credit ratings from stable to negative given expectations that
credit fundamentals will deteriorate as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of the factors that could affect credit
ratings of the Parent Company and the Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries.
                                                        59                                                         
                                         
  CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                         
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with
the default or change in credit profile of a client,
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a
reduction in expected returns on investments,
including consumer credit risk,

wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
Refer to pages 60-78 for a further discussion of
Credit Risk.

Refer to page 79 for a further discussion of
Investment Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and
Investment Risk Management on pages 100–118 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s Credit and Investment Risk
Management framework.
                    
  CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                    
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or
change in credit pr ofile of a client, counterparty or
customer.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL
accounting guidance. The adoption resulted in a change
in the accounting for PCI loans, which are considered
PCD loans under CECL. In conjunction with the adoption
of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and
lending-related commitments from the consumer,
excluding credit card portfolio segment to the
wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the
methodology applied when determining the allowance.
Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with
the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further
information.

The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19
pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant
modifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19
related loan modifications have not been considered t
roubled debt restructurings ( “ TDRs ” ) as:

• they represent short-term or other insignificant
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan
modification assessments or the IA Statement guidance,
or

• the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend
the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as
provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act.

To the extent that certain modifications do not meet
any of the above criteria, the Firm accounts for them
as TDRs. The Firm considers expected losses of
principal and accrued interest associated with all
COVID-19 related loan modifications in its allowance
for credit losses. Refer to Business Developments on
pages 9-10 for more information on customer and client
assistance granted. Refer to Notes 12 and 13 for
further information on the Firm’s accounting policies
on loan modifications and the allowance for credit
losses.

The effectiveness of the Firm’s actions in helping
borrowers recover and in mitigating the Firm’s credit
losses remains uncertain in light of the unpredictable
nature and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19
pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies,
nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those
customers and clients who would have otherwise moved
into past due or nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer
Credit Portfolio on pages 62-66 and Wholesale Credit
Portfolio on pages 67-76 for information on loan
modifications as of September 30, 2020.

In the following tables, reported loans include loans
retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-
sale; and certain loans accounted for at fair value.
The following tables do not include loans which the
Firm accounts for at fair value and classifies as
trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further
information regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12,
23, and 5 for additional information on the Firm’s
loans, lending-related commit ments and derivative
receivables, including the Firm’s accounting policies.

Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit
risk inherent in the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio; and refer to Note 11 for information
regarding the credit risk inherent in the securities
financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer Credit
Portfolio on pages 62-66 and Note 12 for further
discussions of the consumer credit environment and
consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on
pages 67-76 and Note 12 for further discussions of the
wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (b)
Receivables from customers and other reflect brokerage-related held-for-investment customer receivables. (c)
Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold through credit derivatives used to manage both
performing and nonperforming wholesale credit exposures; these derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting
under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Credit derivatives on page 76 and Note 5 for additional information. (d) Prior-period
amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. (e) Includes collateral related to derivative
instruments where appropriate legal opinions have not been either sought or obtained with respect to master netting
agreements. (f) At both September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90
or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.1 billion. Prior-period amount has been revised
to conform with the current presentation, refer to footnote (a) above for additional information. At September 30,
2020, and December 31, 2019, nonperforming assets also excluded real estate owned (“REO”) insured by U.S.
government agencies of $10 million and $41 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on
nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination
Council (“FFIEC”). (g) At September 30, 2020, nonperforming loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans on nonaccrual
status. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income
on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools was performing.

Paycheck Protection Program The PPP, established by the CARES Act and implemented by the SBA, provided the Firm
with delegated authority to process and originate PPP loans until the program closed in early August 2020. When
certain criteria are met, PPP loans are subject to forgiveness and the Firm will receive payment of the forgiveness
amount from the SBA. PPP loans have a contractual term of two or five years and provide borrowers with an automatic
payment deferral of principal and interest. Given that PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA, the Firm does not
expect to realize material credit losses on these loans. PPP processing fees are deferred and accreted into
interest income over the contractual life of the loans, but may be accelerated upon forgiveness or prepayment. The
impact on interest income related to PPP loans was not material for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2020. At September 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $28 billion of loans under the PPP, of which $20 billion
and $8 billion are in Consumer and Wholesale, respectively.

  CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                             
The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans,
scored auto and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on
serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. Refer to Note 12 for further information on
consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note 23 for further
information on lending-related commitments.

Weakness in the macroeconomic environment driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in an increase
in the allowance for credit losses in the first half of 2020. The continuation or worsening of the effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment and the extent to which customer assistance and government
stimulus efforts are effective could result in further impacts to credit quality metrics, including delinquencies,
nonaccrual loans and charge-offs.

The following table presents consumer credit-related information with respect to the scored credit portfolios held
in CCB, AWM, CIB and Corporate.

equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 23 for further
information.

(h) Includes billed interest and fees.

(i) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.

(j) At both September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past
due and insured by U.S. government agencies of $1.1 billion. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with
the current presentation, refer to footnote (e) above for additional information. These amounts have been excluded
from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt
credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance issued by the FFIEC.

(k) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.5 billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL,
nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the
pools was performing.

(l) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due,
predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $16.0 billion and $24.8 billion for the three
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and were $18.2 billion and $18.8 billion for the nine
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation, refer to footnote (e) above for additional information. These amounts were excluded when
calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly
in the form of payment deferrals.

As of September 30, 2020, the Firm had $12.3 billion of loans under payment deferral programs, which represented a
decrease of approximately $16.0 billion from June 30, 2020. During the third quarter of 2020, there were
approximately $2.2 billion of new enrollments in payment deferral programs largely in the residential real estate
loan class. Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment deferral programs are current. The Firm continues to
monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an
ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected
losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

The following table presents information related to the $12.3 billion and $28.3 billion unpaid principal balance of
retained loans under payment deferral programs as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and those
that have exited payment deferral programs as of September 30, 2020.

(a) Excludes $17.1 billion and $34.0 billion of third-party mortgage loans serviced at September 30, 2020 and June
30, 2020, respectively.

(b) Excludes risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans held in CCB and auto operating lease assets that
were still under payment deferral programs as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020. Auto operating lease asset
payment assistance is currently offering one month payment deferral (initially offered three month payment
deferral). Deferrals do not extend the term of the lease and all deferred payments are due at the end of the lease
term.

(c) Includes $3.8 billion and $5.7 billion of loans that were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral as of
September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively.

(d) Represents the unpaid principal balance of retained loans which were still under payment deferral programs,
divided by the total unpaid principal balance of the respective loan classes retained loans.

Of the $12.3 billion of loans still under payment deferral programs as of September 30, 2020, approximately $3.9
billion were accounted for as TDRs, either because they were accounted for as TDRs prior to payment deferral, or
because they did not qualify for or the Firm did not elect the option to suspend TDR accounting guidance provided
under section 4013 of the CARES Act. All or a portion of the remaining $8.4 billion of loans could become TDRs in
future periods, depending on the nature and timing of further modifications or payment arrangements offered to
these borrowers. If the remaining $8.4 billion of loans were considered TDRs, the Firm estimates that it would
result in an increase in standardized RWA of as much as $4.1 billion.

Predominantly all borrowers were current upon enrollment in payment deferral programs and are expected to exit
payment deferral programs in a current status, either because no payments are contractually due during the deferral
period or because payments originally contractually due during the deferral period will be modified to be due at
maturity upon exit. For those borrowers that are not modified upon exit from payment deferral programs and are
unable to resume making payments in accordance with the contractual terms of their agreements, they will be placed
on nonaccrual status in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual policy, except for credit cards as permitted by regulatory
guidance, and charged off in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies. Refer to Note 12 for additional
information on the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies.

Portfolio analysis Loan balances increased from
December 31, 2019 due predominantly to PPP loan
originations in Business Banking, partially offset by
lower residential real estate loans, reflecting
paydowns and loan sales. Residential real estate: The
residential real estate portfolio, including loans
held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly
consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines
of credit. The portfolio decreased from December 31,
2019 driven by paydowns and loan sales in Home
Lending, largely offset by originations of prime
mortgage loans that have been retained on the balance
sheet. Retained nonaccrual loans increased from
December 31, 2019 due predominantly to the inclusion
of PCD loans, which prior to the adoption of CECL were
considered performing PCI loans and customers that
have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are
90 or more days past due. Net charge-offs for the
three months ended September 30, 2020 were higher when
compared with the same period in the prior year as the
current quarter included losses associated with the
PCD portfolio, as well as loans charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell related to
certain customers that have exited COVID-19 payment
deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due.
Net recoveries for the nine months ended September 30,
2020 were higher when compared with the same period in
the prior year as the current year benefited from a
recovery on a loan sale. The carrying value of home
equity lines of credit outstanding was $25.8 billion
at September 30, 2020. This amount included $9.1
billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only
to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and
$8.1 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which
primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk
of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or
reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by
law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile. At
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the
carrying value of interest-only residential mortgage
loans were $24.8 billion and $22.5 billion,
respectively. These loans have an interest-only
payment period generally followed by an adjustable-
rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to
maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers,
predominantly in AWM. Performance of this portfolio
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020
was in line with the performance of the broader
residential mortgage portfolio for the same period.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, including
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

(a) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, $6
million and $14 million, respectively, of loans
modified subsequent to repurchase from Ginnie Mae in
accordance with the standards of the appropriate
government agency (i.e., Federal Housing
Administration (“FHA”), U.S. Department of Veterans
Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing Service of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture (“RHS”)) are not included in
the table above. When such loans perform subsequent to
modification in accordance with Ginnie Mae guidelines,
they are generally sold back into Ginnie Mae loan
pools. Modified loans that do not re-perform become
subject to foreclosure. Refer to Note 14 for
additional information about sales of loans in
securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae. (b) At
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, nonaccrual
loans included $2.5 billion and $1.9 billion,
respectively, of TDRs for which the borrowers were
less than 90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 for
additional information about loans modified in a TDR
that are on nonaccrual status. (c) At September 30,
2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.2 billion of PCD
loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL, nonaccrual loans
excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest
income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the pools
was performing. (d) Amount represents the unpaid
principal balance of modified PCI loans at December
31, 2019, which were moved to retained loans upon the

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio
predominantly consists of prime-quality scored auto
and business banking loans, as well as overdrafts. The
portfolio increased when compared with December 31,
2019, predominantly due to PPP loan originations of
$21.9 billion in Business Banking of which $20.3
billion remained outstanding at September 30, 2020 as
well as from growth in the auto portfolio from loan
originations, partially offset by paydowns and charge-
offs or liquidation of delinquent loans. The scored
auto portfolio net charge-off rates were 0.04% and
0.41% for the three months ended September 30, 2020
and 2019, respectively, and 0.28% and 0.42% for the
nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019,
respectively. Auto charge-offs for the three months
ended September 30, 2020 benefited from payment
assistance programs and high vehicle collateral
values. Nonperforming assets The following table

(a) At both September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,
nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or
more days past due and insured by U.S. government
agencies of $1.1 billion. Prior-period amount has been
revised to conform with the current presentation,
refer to footnote (b) below for additional
information. At September 30, 2020, and December 31,
2019, nonperforming assets also excluded REO insured
by U.S. government agencies of $10 million and $41
million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded based upon the government guarantee. (b) In
the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified
certain fair value option elected lending-related
positions from trading assets to loans. Prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation. (c) Generally excludes loans under
payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Includes loans to customers that
have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are
90 or more days past due, predominantly all of which
were considered collateral-dependent and charged down
to the lower of amortized cost or fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. (d) At
September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $1.5
billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL,
nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm
recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans
as each of the pools was performing. (e) Prior-period
amount has been revised to conform with the current
presentation.

(a) At September 30, 2020, loans under payment

Total credit card loans decreased from December 31,
2019 reflecting a decline in sales volume beginning in
March as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the
impact of seasonality. The September 30, 2020 30+ and
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.57% and 0.69%,
respectively, decreased compared to the December 31,
2019 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.87% and
0.95%, respectively. The delinquency rates were
positively impacted by borrowers who received payment
assistance and government stimulus. Net charge-offs
decreased for the three months ended September 30,
2020 compared with the same period in the prior year
reflecting lower charge-offs and higher recoveries,
and benefited from the effect of payment assistance
and government stimulus programs. Net charge-offs
decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2020
compared with the same period in the prior year
reflecting higher recoveries.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 12 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.
                                                                                                                   
  Modifications of credit card loans                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
At September 30, 2020 the Firm had $1.4 billion of
credit card loans outstanding that have been modified
in TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered TDRs, compared to $1.5 billion at December
31, 2019. Refer to Note 12 for additional information
about loan modification programs to borrowers.
                                                        66                                                         
                              
  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 69-73 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated business banking and auto dealer
exposures held in CCB for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for credit
losses. The macroeconomic environment, driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in broad-based
credit deterioration and an increase in the allowance for credit losses. In the nine months ended September 30,
2020, the investment-grade percentage of the portfolio decreased from 74% to 71%, and criticized exposure increased
$22.3 billion from $15.1 billion to $37.4 billion, primarily driven by downgrade activity in the first half of the
year. The increase in criticized exposure was largely driven by downgrades in Consumer & Retail and Oil & Gas. The
continuation or worsening of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the macroeconomic environment could result in
further impacts to credit quality metrics, including investment-grade percentages, as well as to criticized and
nonperforming exposures and charge-offs. Lending-related commitments and retained loans increased by $23.7 billion
and $19.2 billion, respectively, in the nine months ended September 30, 2020, driven by increases across CB, AWM
and CIB, including loans under the PPP. Outstanding loan balances under committed revolving credit facilities as of
September 30, 2020 have returned to near the levels that existed before the increased drawdown activity in March as
a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm
reclassified certain fair value option elected
lending-related positions from trading assets to
loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to
conform with the current presentation. (b) Receivables
from customers and other reflect brokerage-related
held-for-investment customer receivables to clients in
CIB and AWM; these are classified in accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance
sheets. (c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to
conform with the current presentation. (d) Represents
the net notional amount of protection purchased and
sold through credit derivatives used to manage both
performing and nonperforming wholesale credit
exposures; these derivatives do not qualify for hedge
accounting under U.S. GAAP. Refer to Credit

information. (e) Loans that were modified in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be risk-rated in
accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk
management framework. As of September 30, 2020,
predominantly all of these loans were considered
performing.

In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly
in the form of payment deferrals and covenant modifications.

As of September 30, 2020, the Firm had approximately $6.3 billion of retained loans still under payment deferral,
which has decreased approximately $10.5 billion from the second quarter, predominantly driven by $8.8 billion of
loans to performing auto dealer clients where the deferral period ended on June 30, 2020. Predominantly all clients
coming out of deferral are current, and the Firm has not experienced significant new payment deferral requests. The
remaining deferrals are largely concentrated in Real Estate, predominantly within multifamily and retail, nearly
all of which are scheduled to resume payments in the fourth quarter. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk
associated with loans subject to deferrals throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the
borrowers are required to resume making regularly scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and
accrued interest on these loans in its allowance for credit losses.

(a) Represents the balance of the retained loans which were still under payment deferral, divided by the respective
industry total retained loans balance.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both
payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications
were insignificant or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as
provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act. These loans continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s
overall credit risk management framework. As of September 30, 2020, predominantly all of these loans were
considered performing.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(b) Represents loans held-for-sale, primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio, and loans at fair value.

(c) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(d) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties.

(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(f) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is based on the
remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at September 30, 2020, may

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification
of its industry exposures, and pays particular
attention to industries with actual or potential
credit concerns. Exposures deemed criticized align
with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of
criticized exposures, which consist of the special
mention, substandard and doubtful categories.

Total criticized exposure excluding loans held-for-
sale and loans at fair value, was $37.4 billion at
September 30, 2020, compared with $15.1 billion at
December 31, 2019, representing approximately 3.5% and
1.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively.
The increase in total criticized exposure was largely
driven by downgrades in Consumer & Retail and Oil &
Gas due to impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Predominantly all of the $37.4 billion was performing
and approximately half was undrawn.

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans
to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate
and institutional clients to high-net-worth
individuals. Refer to Note 12 for a further discussion
on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality
indicators. The following table presents the change in
the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the nine months
ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The increase was
driven by downgrades across multiple industries on
client credit deterioration, with the largest
concentration in Real Estate, predominantly within
retail and lodging.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 23 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments. Receivables from Customers Receivables
from customers reflect held-for-investment margin
loans to brokerage clients in CIB and AWM that are
collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’
brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities), as such
generally no allowance for credit losses is held
against these receivables. To manage its credit risk
the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors
the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets. Derivative contracts Derivatives
enable clients and counterparties to manage risks
including credit risk and risks arising from
fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange,
equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses
derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making
activities, including the counterparty credit risk
arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also
uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit
risk and other market risk exposure. Refer to Note 5
for a further discussion of derivative contracts. The
following table summarizes the net derivative
receivables for the periods presented.

(a) Includes collateral related to derivative instruments where appropriate legal opinions have not been either
sought or obtained with respect to master netting agreements.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on the Consolidated balance sheets were $76.6 billion and $49.8
billion at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively, with increases in CIB resulting from market
movements. Derivative receivables represent the fair value of the derivative contracts after giving effect to
legally enforceable master netting agreements and cash collateral held by the Firm. However, in management’s view,
the appropriate measure of current credit risk should also take into consideration additional liquid securities
(primarily U.S. government and agency securities and other Group of Seven nations (“G7”) government securities) and
other collateral held by the Firm aggregating $20.4 billion and $16.0 billion at September 30, 2020, and December
31, 2019, respectively, that may be used as security when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s
favor. The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily cash, G7 government securities, other liquid government
agency and guaranteed securities, and corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by clients at the initiation
of transactions, as well as collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily call frequency and collateral
that the Firm has agreed to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting date. Although this collateral does
not reduce the balances and is not included in the table above, it is available as security against potential
exposure that could arise should the fair value of the client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor.
Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements.

As previously noted, the Firm uses collateral
agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The
percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter derivative
contracts subject to collateral agreements — excluding
foreign exchange spot trades, which are not typically
covered by collateral agreements due to their short
maturity and centrally cleared trades that are settled
daily — was approximately 87% and 90% at September 30,
2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Credit
derivatives The Firm uses credit derivatives for two
primary purposes: first, in its capacity as a market-
maker, and second, as an end-user, to manage the
Firm’s own credit risk associated with various
exposures.

Credit portfolio management activities Included in the
Firm’s end-user activities are credit derivatives used
to mitigate the credit risk associated with
traditional lending activities (loans and lending-
related commitments) and derivatives counterparty
exposure in the Firm’s wholesale businesses
(collectively, “credit portfolio management”
activities). Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL
accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance
established a single allowance framework for all
financial assets measured at amortized cost and
certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This
framework requires that management’s estimate reflects
credit losses over the instrument’s remaining expected
life and considers expected future changes in
macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further
information. The Firm’s allowance for credit losses
comprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which
covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and
risk-rated) and is presented separately on the balance
sheet, • the allowance for lending-related
commitments, which is presented on the balance sheet
in accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is
recognized within Investment Securities on the balance
sheet. Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 for a description
of the policies, methodologies and judgments used to
determine the Firm’s allowances for credit losses on
loans, lending-related commitments, and investment
securities. The allowance for credit losses increased
compared with December 31, 2019, primarily reflecting
the deterioration and uncertainty in the macroeconomic
environment as a result of the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic, consisting of: • a net $8.3 billion addition
in consumer, predominantly in the credit card and
residential real estate portfolios • a net $6.7
billion addition in wholesale, across the LOBs
impacting multiple industry sectors, and • a net $4.3
billion addition as a result of the adoption of CECL.
Discussion of changes in the allowance during 2020 The
increase in the allowance for loan losses and lending
related commitments was primarily driven by an
increase in the provision for credit losses,
reflecting the deterioration in and uncertainty around
the future macroeconomic environment as a result of
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. – In the first
quarter of 2020, management’s macroeconomic forecast
included a decline in the U.S. real GDP of
approximately 25% and an increase in the U.S.
unemployment rate to above 10%, for the first half of
2020, followed by a solid recovery in the second half
of 2020. – In the second quarter of 2020, based on the
increased uncertainty around the duration and depth of
the downturn and speed of economic recovery, the
Firm’s central case assumptions reflected a more
protracted downturn with the slower recovery of U.S.
real GDP. – In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm’s
central case assumptions reflected some near term
improvement in economic trends, however there is
elevated uncertainty around potential impacts to
medium and longer term macroeconomic conditions .

In the first, second and third quarters of 2020, the
Firm’s central case assumptions reflected forecasted
U.S. unemployment rates and cumulative changes in U.S.
real GDP as follows:

(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted reported
U.S. unemployment rate. As a result of elevated
macroeconomic uncertainty beyond the central case, the
Firm continued to place significant weighting on its
adverse scenarios, which incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions outlined above, resulting in weighted
average U.S. unemployment rates, remaining above ten
percent into the fourth quarter of 2021. Subsequent
changes to this forecast and related estimates will be
reflected in the provision for credit losses in future
periods. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates Used
by the Firm on pages 88–90 for further information on
the allowance for credit losses and related management
judgments. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages
62-66, Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages 67-76 and
Note 12 for additional information on the consumer and
wholesale credit portfolios.
                                                        77                                                         
The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are
considered PCD loans under CECL. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans
and lending-related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale
portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have
been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a) Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against the allowance for loan losses when
actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the
time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was removed from a pool.

(b) Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a
TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment.
The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR is
calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty
rates.

(c) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted
by regulatory guidance.

(d) Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $120 million and a provision for credit
losses of $110 million as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet or asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
                                                                                                                   
  Investment securities risk                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Investment securities risk includes the exposure
associated with a default in the payment of principal
and interest. This risk is mitigated given that the
investment securities portfolio held by Treasury and
CIO is predominantly invested in high-quality
securities. At September 30, 2020, the Treasury and
CIO investment securities portfolio, net of allowance
for credit losses, was $529.2 billion, and the average
credit rating of the securities comprising the
portfolio was AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available and where not available, based primarily
upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Corporate
segment results on pages 46-47 and Note 10 for further
information on the investment securities portfolio and
internal risk ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management
on pages 80–84 for further information on the market
risk inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity
Risk Management on pages 55–59 for further information
on related liquidity risk.
                                                                                                                   
  Principal investment risk                                                                                        
                                                                                                                   
Principal investments are typically private non-traded
financial instruments representing ownership or other
forms of junior capital and span multiple asset
classes. These investments are made by dedicated
investing businesses or as part of a broader business
strategy. In general, new principal investments
include tax-oriented investments, as well as
investments made to enhance or accelerate LOB and
Corporate strategic business initiatives. The Firm’s
principal investments are managed by the LOBs and
Corporate and are reflected within their respective
financial results. The aggregate carrying values of
the principal investment portfolios have not been
significantly affected by recent market events as a
result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the duration
and severity of adverse macroeconomic conditions could
subject certain principal investments to impairments,
write-downs, or other negative impacts.

As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the
aggregate carrying values of the principal investment

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
119–126 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

COVID-19 Pandemic

Market Risk Management is actively monitoring the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk
exposures by leveraging existing risk measures and
controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and may be limited in their ability to
measure certain risks or to predict losses. This
imprecision may be heightened when sudden or severe
shifts in market conditions occur, such as those
observed at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. For
additional discussion on model uncertainty refer to
Estimations and Model Risk Management on page 87.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time. This is increasingly important in periods
of sustained, heightened market volatility.
                                                                                                                   
  Value-at-risk                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 135 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 121 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference
between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its
individual components. This reflects the non-additive
nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across
LOBs, Corporate, and risk types.

(b) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may
have occurred on different trading days than the
components and consequently diversification benefit is
not meaningful.

Quarter over quarter results Average total VaR
decreased by $40 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2020 when compared with the prior
quarter. This decrease was driven by the fixed income
risk type, reflecting an overall risk reduction, as
well as the scope refinement described below.
Effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of
VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option
elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-
based measures to more effectively measure the risk
from these loans. In the absence of this refinement,
the average Total VaR and each of the components would
have been different by the amounts reported in the
following table:

Year over year results Average total VaR increased by
$51 million for the three months ended September 30,
2020 when compared with the same period in the prior
year. This increase was driven by the substantial
increase in volatility in the one-year historical
look-back period as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The most significant impacts were reflected in the
fixed income and commodities risk types. Effective
January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to
exclude positions related to the risk management of
interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own
credit spread on fair value option elected
liabilities, and included these positions in other
sensitivity-based measures. Additionally, effective
July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to
exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected
loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based
measures. In the absence of these refinements, the

The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses in the chart below do not
reflect the Firm’s revenue results as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those associated
with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk management
activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded components of
total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The definition of
backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel III capital
rules.

The following chart compares Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses with the Firm’s Risk Management VaR for
the 12 months ended September 30, 2020. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting
disclosed in the Market Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which
are based on Regulatory VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

For the 12 months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 151 of the 260 days, and observed
13 VaR backtesting exceptions, which were predominantly driven by volatility at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic
that was materially higher than the levels realized in the historical data used for the VaR calculation. For the
three months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 44 of the 66 days, and did not observe
any VaR backtesting exceptions as the higher volatility is fully embedded in the look-back period used for the VaR
calculation. Firmwide backtesting loss days can differ from the loss days for which Fixed Income Markets and Equity
Markets posted losses, as disclosed in the CIB Markets revenue results, as the population of positions which
compose each metric are different and due to the exclusion of select components of total net revenue in backtesting
gains and losses as described above. For more information on CIB Markets revenue results, refer to page 36 .

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities but also from the Firm’s traditional
banking activities, which include extension of loans
and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing
debt as well as from the investment securities
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 120 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-
at-risk. One way the Firm evaluates its structural
interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.
Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate
exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest
rates and in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes
to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets
and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other
currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These
simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities,
long term debt and any related interest rate hedges,
and exclude other positions in risk management VaR and
other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
120 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-
risk scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both
short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and
holding long-term rates constant. These scenarios
consider many different factors, including: • The
impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates. •
Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but do not
include assumptions about actions that could be taken
by the Firm in response to any such instantaneous rate
changes. Mortgage prepayment assumptions are based on
the interest rates used in the scenarios compared with
underlying contractual rates, the time since
origination, and other factors which are updated
periodically based on historical experience. • The
pricing sensitivity of deposits, using normalized
deposit betas which represent the amount by which
deposit rates paid could change upon a given change in
market interest rates over the cycle. The deposit
rates paid in these scenarios may differ from actual
deposit rates paid, particularly for retail deposits,
due to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure
of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings at
risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the
Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 8
for additional information). The Firm’s U.S. dollar
sensitivities are presented in the table below.

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as
of September 30, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019
reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for lower
short-term and long-term rates as well as the impact
of changes in the Firm’s balance sheet. The Firm’s
sensitivity to rates is primarily a result of assets
repricing at a faster pace than deposits. Based upon
current and implied market rates as of September 30,
2020, scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in
negative interest rates. The U.S. has never
experienced an interest rate environment where the
Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy.
While the impact of negative interest rates on the
Firm's earnings-at-risk would vary by scenario, a
parallel shift downward of up to 100bps would
negatively impact net interest income. In a negative
interest rate environment, the modeling assumptions
used for certain assets and liabilities require
additional management judgment and therefore, the
actual outcomes may differ from these assumptions. The
Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in
the table below.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate
scenario involving a steeper yield curve with long-
term rates rising by 100 basis points and short-term
rates staying at current levels were not material to
the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019.

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential
impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market
variables. Refer to the table Predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 120 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2020 and December
31, 2019, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply
management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

alternative. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

(b) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(c) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm refined the approach for risk management of certain deferred
compensation, which is recognized through noninterest expense. As a result, certain deferred compensation and
related hedges are now included in other sensitivity-based measures.

(d) Impact recognized through OCI.

(e) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation. In the absence of the scope
refinement, Other debt and equity would have been $(213) million and $(192) million for the periods ending
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively. Refer to Total VaR on page 81 for additional information.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 127–128 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. COVID-19 Pandemic Country Risk Management
continues to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on countries to which the Firm has exposure, leveraging
tailored analysis and existing stress testing, exposure reporting and controls. Risk Reporting The following table
presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2020 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2019. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by
country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the Firm’s view of
any actual or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to
client activity and market flows. The overall increase in top 20 exposures was predominantly driven by client
activity and demand for liquidity, relative to the period ending December 31, 2019. This resulted in an increase in
cash placements primarily with the central banks of Germany, the United Kingdom and Australia.

  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                               
Operational risk is the risk associated with an
adverse outcome resulting from inadequate or failed
internal processes or systems; human factors; or
external events impacting the Firm’s processes or
systems; it includes compliance, conduct, legal, and
estimations and model risk. Operational risk is
inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest
itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business interruptions, cybersecurity attacks,
inappropriate employee behavior, failure to comply
with applicable laws and regulations or failure of
vendors to perform in accordance with their
agreements. Operational Risk Management attempts to
manage operational risk at appropriate levels in light
of the Firm’s financial position, the characteristics
of its businesses, and the markets and regulatory
environments in which it operates. Refer to
Operational Risk Management on pages 129-131 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the Firm’s Operational Risk Management.

Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways.
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance
risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and
Model risk as well as other operational risks, can
lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s

Business and Technology Resiliency Risk

Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond
the Firm’s control such as severe weather, power or
telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third
party to provide expected services, cyberattack,
flooding, transit strikes, terrorism, health
emergencies, the spread of infectious diseases or
pandemics. The Firmwide resiliency program is intended
to enable the Firm to recover its critical business
functions and supporting assets (i.e., staff,
technology and facilities) in the event of a business
interruption, while prioritizing the health and safety

of employees and customers. The program includes
governance, awareness training, and testing of
recovery strategies, as well as strategic and tactical
initiatives to identify, assess, and manage business
interruption and public safety risks. The strength and
proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency program has
played an integral role in maintaining the Firm’s
business operations during and after various events.

  ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                         
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of
operational risk, is the potential for adverse
consequences from decisions based on incorrect or
misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and judgment
based estimations across various businesses and
functions. The estimation methods are of varying
levels of sophistication and are used for many
purposes, such as the valuation of positions,
measurement of risk, sizing the allowance for credit
losses, assessing regulatory capital requirements,
conducting stress testing, and making business
decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the
market or economic environment. This is particularly
true when the current and forecasted environment is
significantly different from the historical
macroeconomic environments upon which the models were
calibrated, as the Firm has experienced during the
COVID-19 pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a
greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform
adjustments to model outputs than in typical periods.

Firm on pages 88–90 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS
securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 for further information on these
judgments as well as the Firm’s policies and
methodologies used to determine the Firm’s allowance
for credit losses.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables (“MEVs”) that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses
being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty
variables. The specific variables that have the
greatest effect on the modeled losses of each
portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, house price index (“HPI”) and U.S. real
gross domestic product (“GDP”).

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices,
corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real
estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a weak labor
market and weak overall economic conditions that will
continue to affect borrowers across the Firm’s
consumer and wholesale lending portfolios. Significant
judgment is required to estimate the severity and
duration of the current economic downturn, as well as
its potential impact on borrower defaults and loss
severities. In particular, macroeconomic conditions
and forecasts regarding the duration and severity of
the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic
have been rapidly changing and remain highly
uncertain. It is difficult to predict exactly how
borrower behavior will be impacted by these changes in
economic conditions. The effectiveness of government
support, customer assistance and enhanced unemployment
benefits should act as mitigants to credit losses, but
the extent of the mitigation impact remains uncertain.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
described on page 77 and in Note 13, the Firm’s
relative adverse scenario assumes a significantly
elevated U.S. unemployment rate through the first half
of 2021, averaging 3.0% higher over the eight-quarter
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 4.3%
in the first quarter of 2021; lower U.S. real GDP with
a slower recovery, remaining nearly 3% lower at the
end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak
difference of nearly 6.8% in the
                                                        88                                                         
fourth quarter of 2020; and an 11.5% further
deterioration in the national HPI with a trough in the
first quarter of 2022. This analysis is not intended
to estimate expected future changes in the allowance
for credit losses, for a number of reasons, including:
• the Firm has placed significant weight on its
adverse scenarios in estimating its allowance for
credit losses as of September 30, 2020, and
accordingly, the existing allowance already reflects
credit losses beyond those estimated under the central
scenario • the impacts of changes in many MEVs are
both interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of
this analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more
severe changes in macroeconomic variables • the
COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs at a speed
and to degrees not seen in recent history, adding
significantly higher degrees of uncertainty around
modeled credit loss estimations which use scenarios
outside of historical experience • significant changes
in the expected severity and duration of the economic
downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the effects
of government support and customer assistance, and the
speed of the subsequent recovery could significantly
affect the Firm’s estimate of expected credit losses
irrespective of the estimated sensitivities described
below. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss
estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of September
30, 2020, the Firm compared the modeled estimates
under its relative adverse scenario to its central
scenario. Without considering the additional weight
the Firm has placed on its adverse scenarios or any
other offsetting or correlated effects in other
qualitative components of the Firm’s allowance for
credit losses for these lending exposures, the
difference between these two scenarios would result in
the following: • An increase of approximately $1
billion for residential real estate loans and lending-
related commitments • An increase of approximately $5
billion for credit card loans • An increase of
approximately $4 billion for wholesale loans and
lending-related commitments This analysis relates only
to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not
intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance
for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential
changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the
judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime
loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and
imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates
based on then-current circumstances and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions
are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the
recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its
process to

consider the available information and associated
risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and
that its estimates of expected credit losses were
reasonable and appropriate for the period ended
September 30, 2020. Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries
a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value.
The majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis,
including, derivatives, structured note products and
certain securities financing agreements. Certain
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home
equity and other loans, where the carrying value is
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.

netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to
a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to
the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would
be reduced if netting were applied, including the
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.
Valuation Estimating fair value requires the
application of judgment. The type and level of
judgment required is largely dependent on the amount
of observable market information available to the
Firm. For instruments valued using internally
developed valuation models and other valuation
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs
and are therefore classified within level 3 of the
valuation hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair
value are more
                                                        89                                                         
significant than those required when estimating the
fair value of instruments classified within levels 1
and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation technique to use.
Second, the lack of observability of certain
significant inputs requires management to assess all
relevant empirical data in deriving valuation inputs
including, for example, transaction details, yield
curves, interest rates, prepayment rates, default
rates, volatilities, correlations, equity or debt
prices, valuations of comparable instruments, foreign
exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to Note 2 for
a further discussion of the valuation of level 3
instruments, including unobservable inputs used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there
is no assurance that any list of risks and
uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to
differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

• Economic, financial, reputational and other impacts
of the COVID-19 pandemic;

• Local, regional and global business, economic and
political conditions and geopolitical events;

• Changes in laws and regulatory requirements,
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting
the Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to
address those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and
scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices,
including dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and
laws;

• Changes in income tax laws and regulations;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including
changes in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending
or savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its
capital and liquidity, including approval of its
capital plans by banking regulators;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or
its subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social
and environmental and sustainability concerns that may
arise, including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an
economic slowdown or other economic or market
disruption, including, but not limited to, in the
interest rate environment;

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its
counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
(including but not limited to mortgages and asset-
backed securities) require the Firm to incur
liabilities or absorb losses not contemplated at their
initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified
employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,
customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Changes in applicable accounting policies, including
the introduction of new accounting standards;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of
certain assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, pandemics or outbreaks of
hostilities, or the effects of climate change, and the
Firm’s ability to deal effectively with disruptions
caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational
systems or those of third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself
against cyberattacks and other attempts by
unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm
or its customers or to disrupt the Firm’s systems; and

• The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part
II,

Item 1A: Risk Factors in this form 10-Q and Part I,
Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form
10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and
JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements. The reader should,
however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent
Form 10-Ks, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Qs, or
Current Reports on Form 8-K.

Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.

(b) The following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs that are consolidated by the
Firm at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The assets of the consolidated VIEs are used to settle the
liabilities of those entities. The holders of the beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the
general credit of JPMorgan Chase. The assets and liabilities in the table below include third-party assets and
liabilities of consolidated VIEs and exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation. Refer to Note
14 for a further discussion.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or “the Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading global financial services firm and one of the largest banking institutions in the U.S., with
operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial services for consumers and small
businesses, commercial banking, financial transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 26 for a
further discussion of the Firm’s business segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan
Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the
accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal,
recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. These
unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial
Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in
prior periods have been reclassified to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated
Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling
financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for
clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by
first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and
14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding
consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and
derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also
permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances when the

Accounting standard adopted January 1, 2020
Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (“CECL”)
The adoption of this guidance established a single
allowance framework for all financial assets measured
at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet credit
exposures. This framework requires that management’s
estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s
remaining expected life and considers expected future
changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 13
for further information.
The following table presents the impacts to the
allowance for credit losses and retained earnings upon
adoption of this guidance on January 1, 2020:

(a) In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm
reclassified risk-rated business banking and auto
dealer loans and lending-related commitments held in
CCB from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio
segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align
with the methodology applied when determining the
allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to
conform with the current presentation. Accordingly, $
0.6billion of the allowance for credit losses at
December 31, 2019 and $( 0.2) billion of the CECL
adoption impact were reclassified.
(b) Represents the recognition of the nonaccretable
difference on purchased credit deteriorated loans and
the Firm's election to recognize the reserve for
uncollectible accrued interest on credit card loans in
the allowance, both of which resulted in a
corresponding increase to loans.
Securities Financing Agreements
As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected the
fair value option for certain securities financing
agreements. The difference between their carrying
amount and fair value was immaterial and was recorded
as part of the Firm’s cumulative-effect adjustment.
Refer to Note 11 for further information.
Investment securities
Upon adoption, HTM securities are presented net of an
allowance for credit losses. The guidance also amended
the previous other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”)
model for AFS securities to incorporate an allowance.
Refer to Note 10 for further information.
Credit quality disclosures As a result of the adoption of this guidance, the Firm expanded credit quality
disclosures for financial assets measured at amortized cost particularly within the retained loan portfolios. Refer
to Note 12 for further information. PCD loans The adoption resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans,
which are considered purchased credit deteriorated (“PCD”) loans under CECL. Upon adoption, the Firm recognized the
nonaccretable difference on PCD loans in the allowance, which resulted in a corresponding increase to loans. PCD
loans are subject to the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies and are now reported in the consumer, excluding
credit card portfolio’s residential real estate loan class. Refer to Note 12 for further information. Changes in
credit portfolio segments and classes In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated
loans and lending-related commitments from the consumer excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale
portfolio segment, to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. The Firm also revised its
loan classes. Prior- period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 12
for further information. Accrued interest receivables As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to continue
classifying accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest on credit card loans, and investment
securities in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit card loans,
accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance recorded in the
allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on credit card loans
are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing interest income. For
other loans and securities, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued
interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing
interest income. Capital transition provisions As disclosed in the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, the Firm initially
elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020 (“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to retained earnings of $2.7 billion to CET1
capital, at 25% per year in each of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
on March 31, 2020, the federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule (issued as final on August 26, 2020)
that provided the option to delay the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-year
transition period (“CECL capital transition provisions”). Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(a) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 109.5billion and $
104.5billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.

(c) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities
                                                        102                                                        
approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost basis is adjusted for changes in fair
value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide consistent
fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each period
presented.

(d) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(e) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2020, and
December 31, 2019, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds,
real estate and other funds, were $ 661million and $ 684million, respectively. Included in these balances at
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, were trading assets of $ 52million and $ 54million, respectively, and
other assets of $ 609million and $ 630million, respectively.

(f) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included within loans were $ 15.6billion and $ 19.8billion,
respectively, of residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 5.2billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively, of commercial
first-lien mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to
sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of $ 8.6billion and $ 13.6billion, respectively.

(g) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 507million, nonagency securities of $ 25million and
non-trading loans of $ 717million.

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 2million, trading loans of $ 44million and non-trading loans of $
405million.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 686million and non-trading loans of $ 684million.

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes level 3 assets and liabilities that are insignificant both individually and in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as
well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range
of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)
for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within
level 3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value
measurement. However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3
components, observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the observable
components of level 3 financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within
level 1 or 2 of the fair value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included
below, the gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management
activities related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes Level 3 assets at fair value, including assets measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis, were 0.6% of total Firm assets at September 30, 2020. The following describes
significant changes to level 3 assets since December 31, 2019, for those items measured at fair value on a
recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 112 for
further information on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020 Level 3 assets were $ 16.4billion at September 30, 2020, reflecting a decrease of $
980million from June 30, 2020 with no movements that were significant and an increase of $ 2.9billion from December
31, 2019. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 was driven by: • $ 2.0billion increase in gross
equity derivative receivables due to gains and purchases net of settlements. • $ 1.3billion increase in non-trading
loans due to net transfers. largely offset by • $ 1.7billion decrease in MSRs due to losses. Refer to the sections
below for additional information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring
basis For the three months ended September 30, 2020, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the
following: • $ 2.2billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $ 2.7billion of gross equity derivative
payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $
2.3billion of non-trading loans, driven by a decrease in observability. • $ 1.1billion of long-term debt driven by
a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured
notes. For the three months ended September 30, 2020, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the
following: • $ 965million of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase in observability and a
decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020, significant
transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 1.7billion of gross equity derivative receivables
and $ 1.9billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in
the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 1.1billion of long-term debt driven by an increase in observability
and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. For the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2019, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2019, significant transfers from level 3 to level 2 included $ 906million and $
927million, respectively of gross commodities derivative payables as a result of an increase in observability. All
transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to
occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.

for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring
basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude
any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities
where the financial instruments are classified as
level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
rollforward tables on pages 105-111 for further
information on these instruments. Three months ended
September 30, 2020 • $ 744million of net losses on
assets, driven by market movements in net equity
derivative receivables. • $ 763million of net losses
on liabilities, driven by market movements in long-
term debt. Three months ended September 30, 2019 • $
1.6billion of net losses on assets, predominantly
driven by net derivative receivables due to market
movements and MSRs largely reflecting faster
prepayment speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 15 for
information on MSRs. • $ 205million of net losses on
liabilities, none of which were significant. Nine
months ended September 30, 2020 • $ 374million of net
gains on assets, driven by gains in net interest rate
derivative receivables due to market movements largely
offset by losses in MSRs reflecting faster prepayment
speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note 15 for additional
information on MSRs. • $ 845million of net gains on
liabilities, predominantly driven by market movements
in long-term debt. Nine months ended September 30,
2019 • $ 2.5billion of net losses on assets, driven by
net derivative receivables due to market movements and
MSRs reflecting faster prepayment speeds on lower
rates. Refer to Note 15 for additional information on
MSRs. • $ 2.3billion of net losses on liabilities,
predominantly driven by market movements in long-term
debt.

observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer
(measurement alternative). Of the $ 945million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as
of September 30, 2020, $ 377million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative.
These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the
restrictions on the shares.
(b) Represents at September 30, 2020 the net markdowns associated with $ 556million of held-for-sale positions
related to unfunded commitments in the bridge financing portfolio. There were noliabilities measured at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis at September 30, 2019.
(c) Primarily includes certain mortgage loans that were reclassified to held-for-sale.
(d) Of the $ 788million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2020,
$ 471million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying
collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using
information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the
Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 14% to 46% with a weighted average of
30%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such
changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values still
held as of September 30, 2020 and 2019 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related
adjustments recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These
securities are included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by
law, without notice. Refer to page 156 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation
of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial
assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives, that are
issued as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The
profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be
measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are
not included in the table.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.

(b) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were $ 1million and $ 20million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The amounts
were not material for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019.

(c) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.

(d) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(e) Reported in other income.

(f) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than hybrid financial instruments. Refer to Note 7 for further information regarding
interest income and interest expense.

Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding
The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining
contractual principal balance outstanding as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, for loans, long-term
debt and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.
(b) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(c) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of September 30, 2020, and December 31,
2019, respectively.
(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the
fair value option was elected was $ 13.2billion and $ 8.6billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of
$( 115) million and $( 120) million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K, and Note 23
of this Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments. Prior-
period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

  Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in similar
business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic
conditions. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit
risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s
agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels
are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the
portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting
policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the
Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by
industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty
basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales,
securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.
Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular
loan product or industry segment (e.g., real estate), or its exposure to residential real estate loans with high
LTV ratios, results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and collateral coverage
are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for loan losses.
                                                        119                                                        
The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale-related credit exposure
by the Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019. The wholesale
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.
In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments
from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the
methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(b) The industry rankings presented in the table as of December 31, 2019, are based on the industry rankings of the
corresponding exposures at September 30, 2020, not actual rankings of such exposures at December 31, 2019.
(c) Individuals and Individual Entities predominantly consists of Wealth Management clients within AWM and includes
exposure to personal investment companies and personal and testamentary trusts.
(d) In addition to the credit risk exposure to states and municipal governments (both U.S. and non-U.S.) at
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, noted above, the Firm held: $ 7.5billion and $ 6.5billion ,
respectively, of trading assets; $ 20.9billion and $ 29.8billion, respectively, of AFS securities; and $
12.8billion and $ 4.8billion, respectively, of HTM securities, issued by U.S. state and municipal governments.
Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 for further information.
(e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 91% and 9% ,
respectively, at September 30, 2020, and 90% and 10%, respectively, at December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 14 for more
information on exposures to SPEs.
(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB and AWM that
are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities), as such generally no allowance for credit losses is held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors the required
margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other collateral, or to
reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable
on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $ 478.4billion and $ 254.0billion, at September 30, 2020, and December 31,
2019, respectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.
(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit
portfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other
collateral held against derivative receivables.
(i) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
(j) At September 30, 2020, included $ 20.3billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP. PPP loans are
guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-
offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance for loan losses on these loans.
(k) Represents lending-related financial instruments.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page
131 for more information on volumes and types of
credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        123                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, gross and net derivative receivables
and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of non-cash financial instruments (generally U.S. government and agency securities and
other G7 government securities) and cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are shown separately as
“Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the fair value exposure
amount;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.

(b) Represents liquid security collateral as well as cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to
derivative instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the
collateral amounts of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances.
Where this is the case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative
payables balances with that counterparty.

(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.

(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $ 80.1billion and $ 65.9billion at September 30,
2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $ 71.9billion
and $ 54.4billion at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to
OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-
related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared
derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings
downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at September 30,
2020, and December 31, 2019.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2020, and
December 31, 2019, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination
features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional
collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A
downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating
provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain
instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments
requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current
rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”)) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the
hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact
of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged
items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

As of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance
sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the
income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 9.5billion and $ 6.5billion at September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September
30, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 14.4billion and $ 14.9billion,
respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 6.4billion and $ 2.8billion, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost.
(d) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.
(e) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net
interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair
value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Firm includes the gain/(loss) on the hedging derivative in the same
line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of LIBOR-indexed floating-rate assets and floating-rate liabilities. Gains and
losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2019.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $ 709million (after-tax) of net gains recorded in AOCI
at September 30, 2020, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized
in earnings is approximately nine years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash
flows.

For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in
fair value of these amounts directly in other income.
(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. During the
nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm reclassified pre-tax (losses) of $( 8) million to other income
related to the liquidation of certain legal entities and the amount was not material for the three months ended
September 30, 2020. During the nine months ended September 30, 2019, the Firm reclassified net pre-tax gains of $
5million to other income related to the liquidation of certain legal entities. Refer to Note 20 for further
information.
Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified
risk management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not
designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are
used to manage risks associated with certain specified
assets and liabilities, including certain risks
arising from mortgage commitments, warehouse loans,
MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign
currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives
used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in
mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as
well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in
mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate
credit risk associated with lending exposures in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not
include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative
receivables, which is included in gains and losses on
derivatives related to market-making activities and
other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate
foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses
were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.
(c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.
(d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.
(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives and credit-related notes as of September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, where JPMorgan Chase
is the seller of protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit
derivative contracts. The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit
derivative contract is based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives and credit-related notes where
JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Principal transactions
The following table presents all realized and
unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal
transactions revenue. This table excludes interest
income and interest expense on trading assets and
liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall
performance of the Firm’s client-driven market-making
activities in CIB and cash deployment activities in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further
information on interest income and interest expense.
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument
type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making
businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument
types in connection with their market-making and
related risk-management activities; accordingly, the
trading revenue presented in the table below is not
representative of the total revenue of any individual
LOB.

In the first quarter of 2020, in connection with its

Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury
and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019
Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio. Effective January 1, 2020, the
Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance, which also amended the AFS securities impairment guidance. Refer to Note
1 for further information. During the nine months ended September 30, 2020, the Firm transferred $ 100.5billion of
investment securities, consisting of $ 74.4billion in the third quarter of 2020 and $ 26.1billion in the first
quarter of 2020, from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax unrealized gains of $
2.9billion and $ 1.0billion on the securities at the dates of transfer for the quarters ended September 30, 2020,
and March 31, 2020, respectively. Unrealized gains or losses at the date of transfer of these securities continue
to be reported in AOCI and are amortized into interest income on a level-yield basis over the remaining life of the
securities. This amortization will offset the effect on interest income of the amortization of the premium or
discount resulting from the transfer recorded at fair value. Transfers of securities from AFS to HTM are non-cash
transactions and are recorded at fair value.
The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates
indicated.

At September 30, 2020, the investment securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit
rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal
risk ratings). Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of securities and differentiate risk within the
portfolio. The Firm’s internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower
capacity to meet financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and
Moody’s, however the quantitative characteristics (e.g., probability of default (“PD”) and loss given default
(“LGD”)) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and assumptions. Risk ratings are assigned at
acquisition, are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as necessary
over the life of the investment for updated information affecting the issuer’s ability to fulfill its obligations.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 206million and $ 264million, at September 30, 2020
and December 31, 2019, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in
interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by
the U.S. government.

As a result of the adoption of the amended AFS securities impairment guidance, an allowance for credit losses on
AFS securities is required for impaired securities if a credit loss exists. AFS securities are considered impaired
if the fair value is less than the amortized cost (excluding accrued interest receivable). The Firm recognizes
impairment losses in earnings if the Firm has the intent to sell the debt security, or if it is more likely than
not that the Firm will be required to sell the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost. In these
circumstances the impairment loss recognized in earnings is equal to the full difference between the amortized cost
(excluding accrued interest receivable and net of allowance if applicable) and the fair value of the securities.
For impaired debt securities that the Firm has the intent and ability to hold, the securities are evaluated to
determine if a credit loss exists. If it is determined that a credit loss exists, that loss is recognized as an
allowance for credit losses through the provision for credit losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income,
limited by the amount of impairment. Any impairment not due to credit losses is recorded in OCI. Factors considered
in evaluating credit losses include adverse conditions specifically related to the industry, geographic area or
financial condition of the issuer or underlying collateral of a security; and payment structure of the security.
When assessing securities issued in a securitization for credit losses, the Firm estimates cash flows considering
relevant market and economic data, underlying loan-level data, and structural features of the securitization, such
as subordination, excess spread, overcollateralization or other forms of credit enhancement, and compares the
losses projected for the underlying collateral (“pool losses”) against the level of credit enhancement in the
securitization structure to determine whether these features are sufficient to absorb the pool losses, or whether a
credit loss exists. For beneficial interests in securitizations that are rated below “AA” at their acquisition, or
that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in such a way that the Firm would not recover substantially
all of its recorded investment, the Firm evaluates impairment for credit losses when there is an adverse change in
expected cash flows. Allowance for credit losses Based on its assessment, the Firm did not recognize an allowance
for credit losses on impaired AFS securities as of January 1, 2020 or September 30, 2020.

HTM securities – credit risk The adoption of the CECL
accounting guidance requires management to estimate
expected credit losses on HTM securities over the
remaining expected life and recognize this estimate as
an allowance for credit losses. As a result of the
adoption of this guidance, the Firm recognized an
allowance for credit losses on HTM obligations of U.S.
states and municipalities of $ 10million as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as
of January 1, 2020. Credit quality indicator The
primary credit quality indicator for HTM securities is
the risk rating assigned to each security. At
September 30, 2020, all HTM securities were rated
investment grade and were current and accruing, with
approximately 93% rated AAA. Allowance for credit
losses The allowance for credit losses on HTM
obligations of U.S. states and municipalities and
commercial mortgage-backed securities is calculated by
applying statistical credit loss factors (estimated PD
and LGD) to the amortized cost (excluding accrued
interest receivable). The credit loss factors are
derived using a weighted average of five internally
developed eight-quarter macroeconomic scenarios,
followed by a single year straight-line interpolation
to revert to long run historical information for
periods beyond the forecast period. Refer to Note 13
for further information on the eight-quarter
macroeconomic forecast. The allowance for credit
losses on HTM collateralized loan obligations and U.S.
residential mortgage-backed securities is calculated
as the difference between the amortized cost
(excluding accrued interest receivable) and the
present value of the cash flows expected to be
collected, discounted at the security’s effective
interest rate. These cash flow estimates are developed
based on expectations of underlying collateral
performance derived using the eight-quarter
macroeconomic forecast and the single year straight-
line interpolation, as well as considering the
structural features of the security. The application
of different inputs and assumptions into the
calculation of the allowance for credit losses is
subject to significant management judgment, and
emphasizing one input or assumption over another, or
considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect
the estimate of the allowance for credit losses on HTM
securities. The allowance for credit losses on HTM
securities was $ 120million as of September 30, 2020,
reflecting $ 97million and $ 110million recognized in
the provision for credit losses for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020, respectively.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are
used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be
prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately 4years for agency residential MBS, 3years for agency residential collateralized
mortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

JPMorgan Chase enters into resale, repurchase, securities borrowed and securities loaned agreements (collectively,
“securities financing agreements”) primarily to finance the Firm’s inventory positions, acquire securities to cover
short sales, accommodate customers’ financing needs, settle other securities obligations and to deploy the Firm’s
excess cash. Securities financing agreements are treated as collateralized financings on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets. Where appropriate under applicable accounting guidance, securities financing agreements with the
same counterparty are reported on a net basis. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion of the offsetting of assets
and liabilities. Fees received and paid in connection with securities financing agreements are recorded over the
life of the agreement in interest income and interest expense on the Consolidated statements of income. The Firm
has elected the fair value option for certain securities financing agreements. Refer to Note 3 for further
information regarding the fair value option. The securities financing agreements for which the fair value option
has been elected are reported within securities purchased under resale agreements, securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and securities borrowed on the Consolidated balance sheets. Generally, for agreements
carried at fair value, current-period interest accruals are recorded within interest income and interest expense,
with changes in fair value reported in principal transactions revenue. However, for financial instruments
containing embedded derivatives that would be separately accounted for in accordance with accounting guidance for
hybrid instruments, all changes in fair value, including any interest elements, are reported in principal
transactions revenue. Securities financing agreements not elected under the fair value option are measured at
amortized cost. As a result of the Firm’s credit risk mitigation practices described below, the Firm did not hold
any allowance for credit losses with respect to resale and securities borrowed arrangements as of September 30,
2020 and December 31, 2019. Credit risk mitigation practices Securities financing agreements expose the Firm
primarily to credit and liquidity risk. To manage these risks, the Firm monitors the value of the underlying
securities (predominantly high-quality securities collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S. GSEs and
government agencies MBS) that it has received from or provided to its counterparties compared to the value of cash
proceeds and exchanged collateral, and either requests additional collateral or returns securities or collateral
when appropriate. Margin levels are initially established based upon the counterparty, the type of underlying
securities, and the permissible collateral, and are monitored on an ongoing basis. In resale and securities
borrowed agreements, the Firm is exposed to credit risk to the extent that the value of the securities received is
less than initial cash principal advanced and any collateral amounts exchanged. In repurchase and securities loaned
agreements, credit risk exposure arises to the extent that the value of underlying securities advanced exceeds the
value of the initial cash principal received, and any collateral amounts exchanged. Additionally, the Firm
typically enters into master netting agreements and other similar arrangements with its counterparties, which
provide for the right to liquidate the underlying securities and any collateral amounts exchanged in the event of a
counterparty default. It is also the Firm’s policy to take possession, where possible, of the securities underlying
resale and securities borrowed agreements. Refer to Note 24 for further information regarding assets pledged and
collateral received in securities financing agreements.

The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of September
30, 2020 and December 31, 2019. When the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master
netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm
nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with
the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to
reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated
balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the
counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet
all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on
the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been
either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the Firm held $ 526million and $ 743million, respectively, of
financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not
qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing
transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities
are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

  Note 12 – Loans                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
Loan accounting framework
The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories: • Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”) • Loans held-for-sale
• Loans at fair value Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for
further information. The following provides a detailed accounting discussion of these loan categories: Loans held-
for-investment Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment are recorded at the principal amount outstanding,
net of the following: charge-offs; interest applied to principal (for loans accounted for on the cost recovery
method); unamortized discounts and premiums; and net deferred loan fees or costs. Credit card loans also include
billed finance charges and fees. Interest income Interest income on performing loans held-for-investment is accrued
and recognized as interest income at the contractual rate of interest. Purchase price discounts or premiums, as
well as net deferred loan fees or costs, are amortized into interest income over the contractual life of the loan
as an adjustment of yield. The Firm classifies accrued interest on loans, including accrued but unbilled interest
on credit card loans, in accrued interest and accounts receivables on the Consolidated balance sheets. For credit
card loans, accrued interest once billed is then recognized in the loan balances, with the related allowance
recorded in the allowance for credit losses. Changes in the allowance for credit losses on accrued interest on
credit card loans are recognized in the provision for credit losses and charge-offs are recognized by reversing
interest income. For other loans, the Firm generally does not recognize an allowance for credit losses on accrued
interest receivables, consistent with its policy to write them off no later than 90 days past due by reversing
interest income. Nonaccrual loans Nonaccrual loans are those on which the accrual of interest has been suspended.
Loans (other than credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured by U.S. government agencies) are placed on
nonaccrual status and considered nonperforming when full payment of principal and interest is not expected,
regardless of delinquency status, or when principal and interest has been in default for a period of 90days or
more, unless the loan is both well-secured and in the process of collection. A loan is determined to be past due
when the minimum payment is not received from the borrower by the contractually specified due date or for certain
loans (e.g., residential real estate loans), when a monthly payment is due and unpaid for 30days or more. Finally,
collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on nonaccrual status. On the date a loan is placed on
nonaccrual status, all interest accrued but not collected is reversed against interest income. In addition, the
amortization of deferred amounts is suspended. Interest income on nonaccrual loans may be recognized as cash
interest payments are received (i.e., on a cash basis) if the recorded loan balance is deemed fully collectible;
however, if there is doubt regarding the ultimate collectibility of the recorded loan balance, all interest cash
receipts are applied to reduce the carrying value of the loan (the cost recovery method). For consumer loans,
application of this policy typically results in the Firm recognizing interest income on nonaccrual consumer loans
on a cash basis. A loan may be returned to accrual status when repayment is reasonably assured and there has been
demonstrated performance under the terms of the loan or, if applicable, the terms of the restructured loan. As
permitted by regulatory guidance, credit card loans are generally exempt from being placed on nonaccrual status;
accordingly, interest and fees related to credit card loans continue to accrue until the loan is charged off or
paid in full. Allowance for loan losses The allowance for loan losses represents the estimated expected credit
losses in the held-for-investment loan portfolio at the balance sheet date and is recognized on the balance sheet
as a contra asset, which brings the amortized cost to the net carrying value. Changes in the allowance for loan
losses are recorded in the provision for credit losses on the Firm’s Consolidated statements of income. Refer to
Note 13 for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for the allowance for loan losses. Charge-offs
Consumer loans are generally charged off or charged down to the net realizable value of the underlying collateral
(i.e., fair value less estimated costs to sell), with an offset to the allowance for loan losses, upon reaching
specified stages of delinquency in accordance with standards established by the FFIEC. Residential real estate
loans, unmodified credit card loans and scored business banking loans are generally charged off no later than
180days past due. Scored auto and modified credit card loans are charged off no later than 120days past due.
Certain consumer loans are charged off or charged down to their net realizable value earlier than the FFIEC charge-
off standards in certain circumstances as follows: • Loans modified in a TDR that are determined to be collateral-
dependent.
                                                        144                                                        
• Loans to borrowers who have experienced an event that suggests a loss is either known or highly certain are
subject to accelerated charge-off standards (e.g., residential real estate and auto loans are charged off or
charged down within 60days of receiving notification of a bankruptcy filing). • Auto loans upon repossession of the
automobile. Other than in certain limited circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs on the
government-guaranteed portion of loans. Wholesale loans are charged off when it is highly certain that a loss has
been realized. The determination of whether to recognize a charge-off includes many factors, including the
prioritization of the Firm’s claim in bankruptcy, expectations of the workout/restructuring of the loan and
valuation of the borrower’s equity or the loan collateral. When a loan is charged down to the estimated net
realizable value, the determination of the fair value of the collateral depends on the type of collateral (e.g.,
securities, real estate). In cases where the collateral is in the form of liquid securities, the fair value is
based on quoted market prices or broker quotes. For illiquid securities or other financial assets, the fair value
of the collateral is generally estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For residential real estate loans,
collateral values are based upon external valuation sources. When it becomes likely that a borrower is either
unable or unwilling to pay, the Firm utilizes a broker’s price opinion, appraisal and/or an automated valuation
model of the home based on an exterior-only valuation (“exterior opinions”), which is then updated at least every
twelve months, or more frequently depending on various market factors. As soon as practicable after the Firm
receives the property in satisfaction of a debt (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession), the Firm
generally obtains an appraisal based on an inspection that includes the interior of the home (“interior
appraisals”). Exterior opinions and interior appraisals are discounted based upon the Firm’s experience with actual
liquidation values as compared with the estimated values provided by exterior opinions and interior appraisals,
considering state-specific factors. For commercial real estate loans, collateral values are generally based on
appraisals from internal and external valuation sources. Collateral values are typically updated every sixto twelve
months, either by obtaining a new appraisal or by performing an internal analysis, in accordance with the Firm’s
policies. The Firm also considers both borrower- and market-specific factors, which may result in obtaining
appraisal updates or broker price opinions at more frequent intervals. Loans held-for-sale Loans held-for-sale are
measured at the lower of cost or fair value, with valuation changes recorded in noninterest revenue. For consumer
loans, the valuation is performed on a portfolio basis. For wholesale loans, the valuation is performed on an
individual loan basis. Interest income on loans held-for-sale is accrued and recognized based on the contractual
rate of interest. Loan origination fees or costs and purchase price discounts or premiums are deferred in a contra
loan account until the related loan is sold. The deferred fees or costs and discounts or premiums are an adjustment
to the basis of the loan and therefore are included in the periodic determination of the lower of cost or fair
value adjustments and/or the gain or loss recognized at the time of sale. Because these loans are recognized at the
lower of cost or fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off policies do not apply to these
loans. However, loans held-for-sale are subject to the nonaccrual policies described above. Loans at fair value
Loans for which the fair value option has been elected are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value
recorded in noninterest revenue. Interest income on these loans is accrued and recognized based on the contractual
rate of interest. Changes in fair value are recognized in noninterest revenue. Loan origination fees are recognized
upfront in noninterest revenue. Loan origination costs are recognized in the associated expense category as
incurred. Because these loans are recognized at fair value, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses and charge-off
policies do not apply to these loans. However, loans at fair value are subject to the nonaccrual policies described
above. Refer to Note 3 for further information on the Firm’s elections of fair value accounting under the fair
value option. Refer to Note 2 and Note 3 for further information on loans carried at fair value and classified as
trading assets.

Loan classification changes Loans in the held-for-investment portfolio that management decides to sell are
transferred to the held-for-sale portfolio at the lower of cost or fair value on the date of transfer. Credit-
related losses are charged against the allowance for loan losses; non-credit related losses such as those due to
changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates are recognized in noninterest revenue. In the event
that management decides to retain a loan in the held-for-sale portfolio, the loan is transferred to the held-for-
investment portfolio at amortized cost on the date of transfer. These loans are subsequently assessed for
impairment based on the Firm’s allowance methodology. Refer to Note 13 for a further discussion of the
methodologies used in establishing the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. Loan modifications The Firm seeks to
modify certain loans in conjunction with its loss mitigation activities. Through the modification, JPMorgan Chase
grants one or more concessions to a borrower who is experiencing financial difficulty in order to minimize the
Firm’s economic loss and avoid foreclosure or repossession of the collateral, and to ultimately maximize payments
received by the Firm from the borrower. The concessions granted vary by program and by borrower-specific
characteristics, and may include interest rate reductions, term extensions, payment delays, principal forgiveness,
or the acceptance of equity or other assets in lieu of payments. Such modifications are accounted for and reported
as TDRs. Loans with short-term and other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not
TDRs. Loans, except for credit card loans, modified in a TDR are generally placed on nonaccrual status, although in
many cases such loans were already on nonaccrual status prior to modification. These loans may be returned to
performing status (the accrual of interest is resumed) if the following criteria are met: (i) the borrower has
performed under the modified terms for a minimum of six monthsand/or sixpayments, and (ii) the Firm has an
expectation that repayment of the modified loan is reasonably assured based on, for example, the borrower’s debt
capacity and level of future earnings, collateral values, LTV ratios, and other current market considerations. In
certain limited and well-defined circumstances in which the loan is current at the modification date, such loans
are not placed on nonaccrual status at the time of modification. Loans modified in TDRs are generally measured for
impairment using the Firm’s established asset-specific allowance methodology, which considers the expected re-
default rates for the modified loans. A loan modified in a TDR generally remains subject to the asset-specific
component of the allowance throughout its remaining life, regardless of whether the loan is performing and has been
returned to accrual status. Refer to Note 13 for further discussion of the methodology used to estimate the Firm’s
asset-specific allowance. The Firm has granted various forms of assistance to customers and clients impacted by the
COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications. The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19
related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs as: • they represent short-term or other insignificant
modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification assessments or as permitted by regulatory
guidance, or • the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs
as provided under section 4013 of the CARES Act. To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the
above criteria, the Firm accounts for them as TDRs. As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place
loans with deferrals granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as
nonaccrual. The Firm considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19
related loan modifications in its allowance for credit losses. Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19
pandemic could delay the recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers
who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Foreclosed property The Firm acquires property
from borrowers through loan restructurings, workouts, and foreclosures. Property acquired may include real property
(e.g., residential real estate, land, and buildings) and commercial and personal property (e.g., automobiles,
aircraft, railcars, and ships). The Firm recognizes foreclosed property upon receiving assets in satisfaction of a
loan (e.g., by taking legal title or physical possession). For loans collateralized by real property, the Firm
generally recognizes the asset received at foreclosure sale or upon the execution of a deed in lieu of foreclosure
transaction with the borrower. Foreclosed assets are reported in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets
and initially recognized at fair value less estimated costs to sell. Each quarter the fair value of the acquired
property is reviewed and adjusted, if necessary, to the lower of cost or fair value. Subsequent adjustments to fair
value are charged/credited to noninterest revenue. Operating expense, such as real estate taxes and maintenance,
are charged to other expense.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.
In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm revised its loan classes. Prior-period amounts have been revised
to conform with the current presentation:
• The consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment’s residential mortgage and home equity loans and lending-
related commitments have been combined into a residential real estate class.
• Upon adoption of CECL, the Firm elected to discontinue the pool-level accounting for PCI loans and to account for
these loans on an individual loan basis. PCI loans are considered PCD loans under CECL and are subject to the
Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off policies. PCD loans are now reported in the consumer, excluding credit card
portfolio segment’s residential real estate class.
• Risk-rated business banking and auto dealer loans and lending-related commitments held in CCB were reclassified
from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment, to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the
methodology applied when determining the allowance. The remaining scored auto and business banking loans and
lending-related commitments have been combined into an auto and other class.
• The wholesale portfolio segment’s classes, previously based on the borrower’s primary business activity, have
been revised to align with the loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory agencies, based on the loan’s
collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.

(a) Reclassifications of loans to held-for-sale are non-cash transactions.
(b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm’s voluntary repurchases
of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”)
guidelines for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. The Firm typically elects to repurchase
these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with
applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.
(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten in
accordance with the Firm’s standards. Such purchases were $ 3.1billion and $ 4.7billion for the three months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 10.5billion and $ 12.2billion for the nine months ended September
30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Gains and losses on sales of loans

Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including adjustments to record loans and
lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value) recognized in noninterest revenue
were $ 113million and $( 75) million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively, of which
$ 24million and $( 76) million, respectively, were related to loans. Net gains on sales of loans were $ 254million
and $ 433million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2019, respectively. In addition, the sale of
loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance recognized in the provision for credit
losses.

Delinquency rates are the primary credit quality indicator for consumer loans. Loans that are more than 30 days
past due provide an early warning of borrowers who may be experiencing financial difficulties and/or who may be
unable or unwilling to repay the loan. As the loan continues to age, it becomes more clear whether the borrower is
likely either unable or unwilling to pay. In the case of residential real estate loans, late-stage delinquencies
(greater than 150 days past due) are a strong indicator of loans that will ultimately result in a foreclosure or
similar liquidation transaction. In addition to delinquency rates, other credit quality indicators for consumer
loans vary based on the class of loan, as follows: • For residential real estate loans, the current estimated LTV
ratio, or the combined LTV ratio in the case of junior lien loans, is an indicator of the potential loss severity
in the event of default. Additionally, LTV or combined LTV ratios can provide insight into a borrower’s continued
willingness to pay, as the delinquency rate of high-LTV loans tends to be greater than that for loans where the
borrower has equity in the collateral. The geographic distribution of the loan collateral also provides insight as
to the credit quality of the portfolio, as factors such as the regional economy, home price changes and specific
events such as natural disasters, will affect credit quality. The borrower’s current or “refreshed” FICO score is a
secondary credit quality indicator for certain loans, as FICO scores are an indication of the borrower’s credit
payment history. Thus, a loan to a borrower with a low FICO score (less than 660 ) is considered to be of higher
risk than a loan to a borrower with a higher FICO score. Further, a loan to a borrower with a high LTV ratio and a
low FICO score is at greater risk of default than a loan to a borrower that has both a high LTV ratio and a high
FICO score. • For scored auto and business banking loans, geographic distribution is an indicator of the credit
performance of the portfolio. Similar to residential real estate loans, geographic distribution provides insights
into the portfolio performance based on regional economic activity and events.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows:
current included $ 10million and $ 17million; 30–149 days past due included $ 29million and $ 20million; and 150 or
more days past due included $ 31million and $ 26million at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.
(b) At September 30, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic which
are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are generally not
considered delinquent.
(c) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by
U.S. government agencies of $ 60million and $ 46million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
Approximately 34% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At September 30, 2020,
approximately 8% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due, respectively.

(b) At September 30, 2020, nonaccrual loans included $ 1.5billion of PCD loans. Prior to the adoption of CECL,
nonaccrual loans excluded PCI loans as the Firm recognized interest income on each pool of PCI loans as each of the
pools was performing.

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the fair value of their
underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral has subsequently improved, the
related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 39million and $ 40million for the three
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 119million and $ 124million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due ,
predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent and charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
fair value of the underlying collateral less costs to sell.

(f) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies.
Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement
rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, these
balances included $ 55million and $ 34million, respectively, of loans that are no longer accruing interest based on
the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. For the remaining balance, interest is being accrued at the guaranteed
reimbursement rate. There were noloans that were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more
days past due and still accruing interest at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019.

(g) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(h) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at September 30, 2020.

(k) At September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $
70million and $ 63million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented
based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The carrying value of new
TDRs was $ 199million and $ 112million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $
537million and $ 386million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were no
additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Nature
and extent of modifications The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including
U.S. GSE programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not
limited to, interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments
that would otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides
information about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs
described above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted
is the discharge of debt and loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered
concessions.

(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently
modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than
one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on
permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the
definition of a TDR for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults
The following table provides information about the financial effects of the various concessions granted in
modifications of residential real estate loans under the loss mitigation programs described above and about
redefaults of certain loans modified in TDRs for the periods presented. The following table presents only the
financial effects of permanent modifications and do not include temporary concessions offered through trial
modifications. This table also excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the discharge of debt.

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and
for which the payment default occurred within one yearof the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real
estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or
another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not
be representative of ultimate redefault levels.

At September 30, 2020, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently
modified in TDRs were 6years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both
voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations). Active and suspended foreclosure At
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by
U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $ 904million and $ 1.2billion, respectively, that were not
included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at September 30, 2020.

Loan modifications Certain other consumer loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various
concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new
TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019. Additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2020 and December 31,
2019 were not material.

Credit card loan portfolio

The credit card portfolio segment includes credit card loans originated and purchased by the Firm. Delinquency
rates are the primary credit quality indicator for credit card loans as they provide an early warning that
borrowers may be experiencing difficulties (30 days past due); information on those borrowers that have been
delinquent for a longer period of time (90 days past due) is also considered. In addition to delinquency rates, the
geographic distribution of the loans provides insight as to the credit quality of the portfolio based on the
regional economy. While the borrower’s credit score is another general indicator of credit quality, the Firm does
not view credit scores as a primary indicator of credit quality because the borrower’s credit score tends to be a
lagging indicator. The distribution of such scores provides a general indicator of credit quality trends within the
portfolio; however, the score does not capture all factors that would be predictive of future credit performance.
Refreshed FICO score information, which is obtained at least quarterly, for a statistically significant random
sample of the credit card portfolio is indicated in the following table. FICO is considered to be the industry
benchmark for credit scores. The Firm generally originates new card accounts to prime consumer borrowers. However,
certain cardholders’ FICO scores may decrease over time, depending on the performance of the cardholder and changes
in the credit score calculation.

The following table provides information on delinquency, which is the primary credit quality indicator for retained
credit card loans.

Loan modifications The Firm may offer one of a number
of loan modification programs granting concessions to
credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial
difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.
Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-
term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that
are not considered concessions are not TDRs.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

The following table provides information about the
financial effects of the concessions granted on credit
card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the
periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new
enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit
card loans.

For credit card loans modified in TDRs, payment
default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower
misses twoconsecutive contractual payments. Defaulted
modified credit card loans remain in the modification
program and continue to be charged off in accordance
with the Firm’s standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients
to high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the internal risk rating
assigned to each loan. Risk ratings are used to identify the credit quality of loans and differentiate risk within
the portfolio. Risk ratings on loans consider the PD and the LGD. The PD is the likelihood that a loan will
default. The LGD is the estimated loss on the loan that would be realized upon the default of the borrower and
takes into consideration collateral and structural support for each credit facility. Management considers several
factors to determine an appropriate internal risk rating, including the obligor’s debt capacity and financial
flexibility, the level of the obligor’s earnings, the amount and sources for repayment, the level and nature of
contingencies, management strength, and the industry and geography in which the obligor operates. The Firm’s
internal risk ratings generally align with the qualitative characteristics (e.g., borrower capacity to meet
financial commitments and vulnerability to changes in the economic environment) defined by S&P and Moody’s, however
the quantitative characteristics (e.g., PD and LGD) may differ as they reflect internal historical experiences and
assumptions. The Firm considers internal ratings equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and these
ratings have a lower PD and/or lower LGD than non-investment grade ratings. Noninvestment-grade ratings are further
classified as noncriticized and criticized, and the criticized portion is further subdivided into performing and
nonaccrual loans, representing management’s assessment of the collectibility of principal and interest. Criticized
loans have a higher PD than noncriticized loans. The Firm’s definition of criticized aligns with the U.S. banking
regulatory definition of criticized exposures, which consist of special mention, substandard and doubtful
categories . Risk ratings are reviewed on a regular and ongoing basis by Credit Risk Management and are adjusted as
necessary for updated information affecting the obligor’s ability to fulfill its obligations. As noted above, the
risk rating of a loan considers the industry in which the obligor conducts its operations. As part of the overall
credit risk management framework, the Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry and client
exposures, with particular attention paid to industries with actual or potential credit concern. Refer to Note 4
for further detail on industry concentrations.

(a) The U.S. and non-U.S. distribution is determined based predominantly on the domicile of the borrower.

(b) The credit quality of wholesale loans is assessed primarily through ongoing review and monitoring of an
obligor’s ability to meet contractual obligations rather than relying on the past due status, which is generally a
lagging indicator of credit quality. Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(c) Represents loans that are considered well-collateralized and therefore still accruing interest.

(a) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the
Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of September 30, 2020, predominantly all of these loans were
considered performing.
(b) When the discounted cash flows, collateral value or market price equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the
loan, the loan does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off
and/or there have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.
(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis were not material for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.
Loan modifications

Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are
experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new TDRs, were not material to
the Firm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019.

  Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm adopted the CECL accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance established
a single allowance framework for all financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-balance sheet
credit exposures. This framework requires that management’s estimate reflects credit losses over the instrument’s
remaining expected life and considers expected future changes in macroeconomic conditions. Refer to Note 1 for
further information. JPMorgan Chase’s allowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance for loan losses, which
covers the Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented separately on the balance
sheet, • the allowance for lending-related commitments, which is presented on the balance sheet in accounts payable
and other liabilities, and • the allowance for credit losses on investment securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM
and AFS securities and is recognized within Investment Securities on the balance sheet. The income statement effect
of all changes in the allowance for credit losses is recognized in the provision for credit losses. Determining the
appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses is complex and requires significant judgment by management about
the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. At least quarterly, the allowance for credit losses is
reviewed by the CRO, the CFO and the Controller of the Firm. Subsequent evaluations of credit exposures,
considering the macroeconomic conditions, forecasts and other factors then prevailing, may result in significant
changes in the allowance for credit losses in future periods. The Firm’s policies used to determine its allowance
for loan losses and its allowance for lending-related commitments are described in the following paragraphs. Refer
to Note 10 for a description of the policies used to determine the allowance for credit losses on investment
securities. Methodology for allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments The allowance for loan
losses and allowance for lending-related commitments represents expected credit losses over the remaining expected
life of retained loans and lending-related commitments that are not unconditionally cancellable. The Firm does not
record an allowance for future draws on unconditionally cancellable lending-related commitments (e.g., credit
cards). Expected losses related to accrued interest on credit card loans and certain performing, modified loans to
borrowers impacted by COVID-19 are included in the Firm’s allowance for loan losses. However, the Firm does not
record an allowance on other accrued interest receivables, due to its policy to write them off no later than 90
days past due by reversing interest income. The expected life of each instrument is determined by considering its
contractual term, expected prepayments, cancellation features, and certain extension and call options. The expected
life of funded credit card loans is generally estimated by considering expected future payments on the credit card
account, and determining how much of those amounts should be allocated to repayments of the funded loan balance (as
of the balance sheet date) versus other account activity. This allocation is made using an approach that
incorporates the payment application requirements of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure
Act of 2009, generally paying down the highest interest rate balances first. The estimate of expected credit losses
includes expected recoveries of amounts previously charged off or expected to be charged off, even if such
recoveries result in a negative allowance. Collective and Individual Assessments When calculating the allowance for
loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments, the Firm assesses whether exposures share similar
risk characteristics. If similar risk characteristics exist, the Firm estimates expected credit losses
collectively, considering the risk associated with a particular pool and the probability that the exposures within
the pool will deteriorate or default. The assessment of risk characteristics is subject to significant management
judgement. Emphasizing one characteristic over another or considering additional characteristics could affect the
allowance. • Relevant risk characteristics for the consumer portfolio include product type, delinquency status,
current FICO scores, geographic distribution, and, for collateralized loans, current LTV ratios. • Relevant risk
characteristics for the wholesale portfolio include LOB, geography, risk rating, delinquency status, level and type
of collateral, industry, credit enhancement, product type, facility purpose, tenor, and payment terms. The majority
of the Firm’s credit exposures share risk characteristics with other similar exposures, and as a result are
collectively assessed for impairment (“portfolio-based component”). The portfolio-based component covers consumer
loans, performing risk-rated loans and certain lending-related commitments. If an exposure does not share risk
characteristics with other exposures, the Firm generally estimates expected credit losses on an individual basis,
considering expected repayment and conditions impacting that individual exposure (“asset-specific component”). The
asset-specific component covers modified PCD loans, loans modified or reasonably expected to be modified in a TDR,
collateral-dependent loans, as well as, risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status. Portfolio-
based component The portfolio-based component begins with a quantitative calculation that considers the likelihood
of the borrower changing delinquency status or moving from one risk rating to another. The quantitative calculation
covers expected credit losses over an instrument’s expected life and is estimated by applying credit loss factors
to the Firm’s estimated exposure at default. The credit loss factors incorporate the probability of borrower
default as well as loss severity in the event of default. They are derived using a weighted average of five
internally developed macroeconomic scenarios over an eight-quarter forecast period, followed by a single year
straight-line interpolation to revert to long run historical information for periods beyond the eight-quarter
forecast period. The five
                                                        159                                                        
macroeconomic scenarios consist of a central, relative adverse, extreme adverse, relative upside and extreme upside
scenario, and are updated by the Firm’s central forecasting team. The scenarios take into consideration the Firm’s
overarching economic outlook, internal perspectives from subject matter experts across the Firm , and market
consensus and involve a governed process that incorporates feedback from senior management across LOBs, Corporate
Finance and Risk Management. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs to degrees not experienced in recent
history, which creates additional challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates and increases the reliance
on management judgment. During the second and third quarters, certain MEVs were outside the range of historical
experience on which the Firm’s models had been calibrated and therefore adjustments were required to appropriately
address these economic circumstances. For example, while forecasted U.S. employment rates in certain of the Firm’s
scenarios are higher than historical experience, such rates are developed on a reported basis and do not reflect
the significant mitigating impact of current government unemployment benefits and other stimulus programs.
Consequently, management considered such mitigating impact to arrive at an effective unemployment rate, which
informed modeled credit loss estimates, particularly in the consumer portfolio. In addition, for the wholesale
portfolio, management used the historical relationship between credit spreads and portfolio default rates to inform
the adjustment of the Firm’s modeled loss estimates. The quantitative calculation is further adjusted to take into
consideration model imprecision, emerging risk assessments, trends and other subjective factors that are not yet
reflected in the calculation. These adjustments are accomplished in part by analyzing the historical loss
experience, including during stressed periods, for each major product or model. Management applies judgement in
making this adjustment, including taking into account uncertainties associated with the economic and political
conditions, quality of underwriting standards, borrower behavior, credit concentrations or deterioration within an
industry, product or portfolio, as well as other relevant internal and external factors affecting the credit
quality of the portfolio. In certain instances, the interrelationships between these factors create further
uncertainties. In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm continued to make qualitative adjustments which placed
significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, as a result of continued uncertainty related to the COVID-19
pandemic. The application of different inputs into the quantitative calculation, and the assumptions used by
management to adjust the quantitative calculation, are subject to significant management judgment, and emphasizing
one input or assumption over another, or considering other inputs or assumptions, could affect the estimate of the
allowance for loan losses and the allowance for lending-related commitments. Asset-specific component To determine
the asset-specific component of the allowance, collateral-dependent loans (including those loans for which
foreclosure is probable) and larger, nonaccrual risk-rated loans in the wholesale portfolio segment are generally
evaluated individually, while smaller loans (both scored and risk-rated) are aggregated for evaluation using
factors relevant for the respective class of assets. The Firm generally measures the asset-specific allowance as
the difference between the amortized cost of the loan and the present value of the cash flows expected to be
collected, discounted at the loan’s original effective interest rate. Subsequent changes in impairment are
generally recognized as an adjustment to the allowance for loan losses. For collateral-dependent loans, the fair
value of collateral less estimated costs to sell is used to determine the charge-off amount for declines in value
(to reduce the amortized cost of the loan to the fair value of collateral) or the amount of negative allowance that
should be recognized (for recoveries of prior charge-offs associated with improvements in the fair value of
collateral). The asset-specific component of the allowance for loan losses that have been or are expected to be
modified in TDRs incorporates the effect of the modification on the loan’s expected cash flows (including forgone
interest, principal forgiveness, as well as other concessions), and also the potential for redefault. For
residential real estate loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, the Firm develops product-specific
probability of default estimates, which are applied at a loan level to compute expected losses. In developing these
probabilities of default, the Firm considers the relationship between the credit quality characteristics of the
underlying loans and certain assumptions about housing prices and unemployment, based upon industry-wide data. The
Firm also considers its own historical loss experience to-date based on actual redefaulted modified loans. For
credit card loans modified in or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate projected
delinquencies and charge-offs based on the Firm’s historical experience by type of modification program. For
wholesale loans modified or expected to be modified in TDRs, expected losses incorporate management’s expectation
of the borrower’s ability to repay under the modified terms. Estimating the timing and amounts of future cash flows
is highly judgmental as these cash flow projections rely upon estimates such as loss severities, asset valuations,
default rates (including redefault rates on modified loans), the amounts and timing of interest or principal
payments (including any expected prepayments) or other factors that are reflective of current and expected market
conditions. These estimates are, in turn, dependent on factors such as the duration of current overall economic
conditions, industry-, portfolio-, or borrower-specific factors, the expected outcome of insolvency proceedings as
well as, in certain circumstances, other economic factors. All of these estimates and assumptions require
significant management judgment and certain assumptions are highly subjective.

Allowance for credit losses and related information
The table below summarizes information about the allowances for loan losses and lending-related commitments, and
includes a breakdown of loans and lending-related commitments by impairment methodology. Refer to Note 10 for
further information on the allowance for credit losses on investment securities.
The adoption of the CECL accounting guidance resulted in a change in the accounting for PCI loans, which are
considered PCD loans. In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-
related commitments from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment,
to align with the methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to
conform with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(a) Prior to the adoption of CECL, write-offs of PCI loans were recorded against the allowance for loan losses when
actual losses for a pool exceeded estimated losses that were recorded as purchase accounting adjustments at the
time of acquisition. A write-off of a PCI loan was recognized when the underlying loan was removed from a pool.

(b) Includes modified PCD loans and loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected to be modified in a
TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the wholesale portfolio segment.
The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to be modified, in a TDR is
calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider any incremental penalty
rates.

(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.

(d) At September 30, 2020 and 2019, lending-related commitments excluded $ 10.8billion and $ 9.4billion,
respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 662.9billion and $ 645.9billion,
respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 23.2billion and $ 24.2billion. respectively, for the
wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

(e) Excludes HTM securities, which had an allowance for credit losses of $ 120million and a provision for credit
losses of $ 110million as of and for the nine months ended September 30, 2020.

Discussion of changes in the allowance during 2020 The increase in the allowance for loan losses and lending
related commitments was primarily driven by an increase in the provision for credit losses, reflecting the
deterioration in and uncertainty around the future macroeconomic environment as a result of the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic. – In the first quarter of 2020, management’s macroeconomic forecast included a decline in the
U.S. real GDP of approximately 25% and an increase in the U.S. unemployment rate to above 10%, for the first half
of 2020, followed by a solid recovery in the second half of 2020. – In the second quarter of 2020, based on the
increased uncertainty around the duration and depth of the downturn and speed of economic recovery, the Firm’s
central case assumptions reflected a more protracted downturn with the slower recovery of U.S. real GDP. – In the
third quarter of 2020, the Firm’s central case assumptions reflected some near term improvement in economic trends,
however there is elevated uncertainty around potential impacts to medium and longer term macroeconomic conditions .
In the first, second and third quarters of 2020, the
Firm’s central case assumptions reflected forecasted
U.S. unemployment rates and cumulative changes in U.S.
real GDP as follows :

(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted reported
U.S. unemployment rate.
As a result of elevated macroeconomic uncertainty
beyond the central case, the Firm continued to place
significant weighting on its adverse scenarios, which
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than
the central case assumptions outlined above, resulting
in weighted average U.S. unemployment rates, remaining
above ten percent into the fourth quarter of 2021.

Subsequent changes to this forecast and related
estimates will be reflected in the provision for
credit losses in future periods.

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of
JPMorgan Chase’s involvement with credit card securitizations. As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement,
the Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the
Chase Issuance Trust. Refer to the table on page 166 of this Note for further information on consolidated VIE
assets and liabilities. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has
securitized) originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans
primarily in its CCB and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective
business involved, the Firm may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the
securitization trusts. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of the Firm’s
involvement with Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts, as well as the accounting treatment
relating to such trusts.

The following table presents the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests. Refer to Securitization activity on page 167 of this Note for further information regarding the
Firm’s cash flows associated with and interests retained in nonconsolidated VIEs, and pages 167-168 of this Note
for information on the Firm’s loan sales and securitization activity related to U.S. GSEs and government agencies.

Multi-seller conduits Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a more detailed description
of JPMorgan Chase’s principal involvement with Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits. In the normal
course of business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in
and invests in commercial paper issued by the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $
11.4billion and $ 16.3billion of the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits
at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,
respectively, which have been eliminated in
consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the
Firm’s funding needs and capacity and were not driven
by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required
to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules,
the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to
purchase the commercial paper issued by the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific
liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been
eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits provide lending-
related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-
administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded
commitments were $ 10.7billion and $ 8.9billion at
September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019,
respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments in other unfunded
commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 23 for
more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond
vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow
institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third
party, refer to pages 166-167 of this Note for further
information. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-
customer TOB transactions. Refer to Note 14 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a more detailed
description of JPMorgan Chase’s Municipal bond
vehicles.

(a) Includes residential and commercial mortgage securitizations.
(b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line
item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated variable interest
entities.” The holders of these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of
JPMorgan Chase. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for conduits program-wide credit enhancements.
Included in beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.2billion and $ 6.7billion
at September 30, 2020, and December 31, 2019, respectively.
(e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or
custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does
not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate
the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would
record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds
investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and
operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party
is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated
to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $
21.5billion and $ 19.1billion, of which $ 7.8billion and $ 5.5billion was unfunded at September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, respectively. In order to reduce the risk of loss, the Firm assesses each project and withholds
varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits. Refer to Note 23 of this Form
10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
                                                        166                                                        
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2019 was $
6.4billion and $ 5.5billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, was $ 9.9billion and $ 8.6billion, respectively. Refer to Note 23 for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of
loans, including residential mortgage, credit card, and commercial mortgage.Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2019 Form 10-K for a further description of the Firm’s accounting policies regarding securitizations.

Securitization activity
The following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to

Ginnie Mae guidelines

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or
guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying
these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated
to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 23 of this
Form 10-Q, and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales-
and securitization-related indemnifications. Refer to Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the
Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to
the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due
to material breaches of representations and warranties
as discussed in Note 23, the Firm also has the option
to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for

Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S.
government agencies under certain arrangements. The
Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans
from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service
them and/or manage the foreclosure process in
accordance with the applicable requirements, and such
loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the
Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such
loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance
sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer
to Note 12 for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2020

loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies.

goodwill impairment testing. The adoption of the
guidance requires recognition of an impairment loss
when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
falls below its carrying value. It eliminated the
requirement that an impairment loss be recognized only
if the estimated implied fair value of the goodwill is
below its carrying value. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the
primary method used to estimate the fair value of the
reporting units and the assumptions used in the
goodwill impairment test. Goodwill is tested for
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
year, or more often if events or circumstances, such
as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate
that there may be an impairment. Unanticipated
declines in business performance, increases in credit
losses, increases in capital requirements, as well as
deterioration in economic or market conditions,
adverse regulatory or legislative changes or increases
in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause
the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting
units to decline in the future, which could result in
a material impairment charge to earnings in a future
period related to some portion of the associated
goodwill. As of September 30, 2020, the Firm reviewed
current economic conditions, including the potential
impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on business
performance, estimated market cost of equity, as well
as actuals and projections of business performance for
all its reporting units. The Firm has concluded that
the goodwill allocated to its reporting units was not
impaired as of September 30, 2020, or December 31,
2019, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment
during the nine months ended September 30, 2020 or
2019.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.

(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities
(“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the
Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.
(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.
(e) The decrease in projected cash flows was largely related to default servicing assumption updates.

regulatory capital.
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

Note 22 – Regulatory capital

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized standards, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) establishes
similar minimum capital requirements and standards for
the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI
subsidiaries are also subject to these capital
requirements established by their respective primary
regulators.
The following table presents the minimum and well-
capitalized ratios to which the Firm and its IDI
subsidiaries were subject as of September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019.

Note: The table above is as defined by the regulations
issued by the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC and to
which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries are subject.
(a) Represents the minimum capital ratios applicable
to the Firm under Basel III. The CET1, Tier 1 and
Total capital minimum capital ratios include a capital
conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% and GSIB
surcharge of 3.5% as calculated under Method 2.
(b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI
subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital
minimum capital ratios include a capital conservation
buffer requirement of 2.5% that is applicable to the
IDI subsidiaries. The IDI subsidiaries are not subject
to the GSIB surcharge.
(c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies
pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.
(d) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries
pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC
Improvement Act.
(e) Represents minimum SLR requirement of 3.0%, as
well as supplementary leverage buffer requirements of
2.0% and 3.0% for BHC and IDI, respectively.

Current Expected Credit Losses

As disclosed in the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, the Firm
initially elected to phase-in the January 1, 2020
(“day 1”) CECL adoption impact to retained earnings of
$2.7 billion to CET1 capital, at 25% per year in each
of 2020 to 2023. As part of their response to the
impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 31, 2020,
the federal banking agencies issued an interim final
rule (issued as final on August 26, 2020) that
provided the option to delay the effects of CECL on
regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-
year transition period.
                                                        177                                                        
The final rule provides a uniform approach for estimating the effects of CECL compared to the legacy incurred loss
model during the first two years of the transition period (the “day 2” transition amount), whereby the Firm may
exclude from CET1 capital 25% of the change in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD loans).
The cumulative day 2 transition amount as at December 31, 2021 that is not recognized in CET1 capital as well as
the $ 2.7billion day 1 impact, will be phased into CET1 capital at 25% per year beginning January 1, 2022. The Firm
has elected to apply the CECL capital transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period ended September 30,
2020, the capital metrics of the Firm exclude $ 6.4billion, which is the $ 2.7billion day 1 impact to retained
earnings and 25% of the $ 15.2billion increase in the allowance for credit losses (excluding allowances on PCD
loans). The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions on Tier 2 capital, adjusted average assets, and total
leverage exposure have also been incorporated into the Firm’s capital metrics. Refer to Note 1 for further
information on the CECL accounting guidance.

The following tables present the risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics for JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. under both the Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced Approaches. As of September 30, 2020,
the capital metrics are presented applying the CECL capital transition provisions. As of September 30, 2020 and
December 31, 2019, JPMorgan Chase and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were well-capitalized and met all capital

(a) The capital adequacy of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is evaluated against the lower of the two ratios
as calculated under Basel III approaches (Standardized or Advanced).

(b) Adjusted average assets, for purposes of calculating the leverage ratio, includes total quarterly average
assets adjusted for on-balance sheet assets that are subject to deduction from Tier 1 capital, predominantly
goodwill and other intangible assets.

(c) As of September 30, 2020, JPMorgan Chase’s total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating the SLR,
excludes on-balance sheet amounts of U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve Banks, as provided by
the interim final rule issued by the Federal Reserve on April 1, 2020. On June 1, 2020, the Federal Reserve, OCC
and FDIC issued an interim final rule that provides IDI subsidiaries with an option to apply this temporary
exclusion subject to certain restrictions. As of September 30, 2020, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has not elected to
apply this exclusion.

(d) As of September 30, 2020, the capital metrics for the Firm reflect the exclusion of assets purchased from money
market mutual fund clients pursuant to nonrecourse advances provided under the MMLF. Additionally, loans originated
under the PPP in the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. receive a zero percent risk weight.

  Note 23 – Off–balance sheet lending-related                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments, including the impact of the Firm’s adoption of the CECL accounting
guidance on January 1, 2020. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying values of off-
balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at September 30, 2020, and
December 31, 2019. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business banking
lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced,
and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at the same time.
The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by providing the
borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm typically closes
credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close HELOCs when there are
significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a demonstrable decline in the
creditworthiness of the borrower.
                                                        179                                                        
In conjunction with the adoption of CECL, the Firm reclassified risk-rated loans and lending-related commitments
from the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment to the wholesale portfolio segment, to align with the
methodology applied when determining the allowance. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the
current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of
commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper

Derivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm
transacts in certain derivative contracts that have
the characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.
Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a
contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the
merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s
issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant.
If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for
the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs.
The carrying value of the valuation allowance was $ 14million and $ 11million at September 30, 2020 and December
31, 2019, respectively.

Loan sales- and securitization-related
indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s
mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with
GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties
that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and
that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans
and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such
representations and warranties are breached by the
Firm. Further, although the Firm’s securitizations are
predominantly nonrecourse, the Firm does provide
recourse servicing in certain limited cases where it
agrees to share credit risk with the owner of the
mortgage loans. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2019 Form 10-K for additional information. The
liability related to repurchase demands associated
with private label securitizations is separately
evaluated by the Firm in establishing its litigation
reserves. Refer to Note 25 of this Form 10-Q and Note
30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional
information regarding litigation. Sponsored member
repo program The Firm acts as a sponsoring member to
clear eligible overnight resale and repurchase
agreements through the Government Securities Division
of the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on
behalf of clients that become sponsored members under
the FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC
the prompt and full payment and performance of its
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under
the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability
under these overnight guarantees by obtaining a
security interest in the cash or high-quality
securities collateral that the clients place with the
clearing house therefore the Firm expects the risk of
loss to be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible
exposure, without taking into consideration the
associated collateral, is included in the Exchange &
clearing house guarantees and commitments line on page
180. Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form
10-K for additional information on credit risk
mitigation practices on resale agreements and the
types of collateral pledged under repurchase
agreements. Guarantees of subsidiaries The Parent
Company has guaranteed certain long-term debt and
structured notes of its subsidiaries, including
JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a
100%-owned finance subsidiary. All securities issued
by JPMFC are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by
the Parent Company. These guarantees, which rank on
parity with the Firm’s unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness, are not included in the table on page
180 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2019 Form 10-K for additional information.

Note 24 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.

information on the Firm’s securities financing
activities. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019
Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.

Contingencies

As of September 30, 2020, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants, putative defendants or
respondents in numerous legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations and regulatory/government
investigations. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits
with potentially millions of class members. Investigations involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both
governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of
adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several
geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust,
securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the
estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal
proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.7billion at September 30, 2020. This estimated aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the
Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not
believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of
multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous
yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of
many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,
including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about
the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be
incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into
account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the
Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual
losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Advisory
and Other Activities . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. has been advised by one of its U.S. regulators of a potential
civil money penalty action against the Bank related to historical deficiencies in internal controls and internal
audit over certain advisory and other activities. The Bank already has controls in place to address the
deficiencies related to the proposed penalty. The Firm is currently engaged in resolution discussions with the U.S.
regulator. There is no assurance that such discussions will result in resolution. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement
Directorate (“ED”) is investigating JPMorgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and
2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed
by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali including
petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home
buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India since 2017 pursuant to its jurisdiction over
public interest litigation. In July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings
that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had
invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to
conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management
Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the Enforcement Directorate issued a provisional attachment order as part of the
criminal PMLA proceedings freezing approximately $ 25million held by JPMorgan India Private Limited. In June 2020,
the funds were transferred to an account held by the Supreme Court of India. A separate civil proceeding relating
to alleged FEMA violations is ongoing. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the investigation. Federal
Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated an escrow and depository account for the Federal
Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil companies. The account held approximately $
1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights to an oil field. Following the settlement of
the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with
directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim
in the English High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to
be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. was or should have been on notice that the payments
may be fraudulent. JPMorgan

Chase Bank, N.A. applied for summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and no trial date has been
set. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain
government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to
those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal
antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment entered thereafter and a term of probation
ending in January 2020. The term of probation has concluded, with the Firm remaining in good standing throughout
the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-yearexemption of disqualification that allows
the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the
Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need to reapply in due course
for a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-yeardisqualification period. A South Africa Competition
Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending before the South
Africa Competition Tribunal. In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs,
which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign
exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX futures and options on futures.
Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded from the class, and certain of
them filed a complaint against the Firm and a number of other foreign exchange dealers in November 2018. A number
of these actions remain pending. Further, putative class actions have been filed against the Firm and a number of
other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly
inflated rates and purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments; these actions also remain pending in the
District Court. In 2020, the Firm and 11other defendants agreed to settle the class action filed by purported
indirect purchasers for a total of $ 10million. That settlement remains subject to court approval. In addition,
some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed
outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel and Australia. Interchange Litigation. G roups of merchants and
retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain
banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation
of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of
credit card interchange, and modifications to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of
that settlement was reversed on appeal, the case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York for further proceedings consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was
divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive
relief. In September 2018, the parties to the class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which
amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively
contributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the
original settlement. In December 2019, the amended agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants
appealed the District Court’s approval order, and those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants
that opted out of the amended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the
settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief
continues separately. In addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations
against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from
various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s
London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm
and other banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the
Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an
appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been
named as a defendant along with other banks in a series of individual and putative class actions related to
benchmarks, including U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA and, in a separate
consolidated putative class action, during the period that it was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration.
These actions have been filed, or consolidated for pre-trial purposes, in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York. In these actions, plaintiffs make varying allegations that in various periods,
starting in 2000 or later, defendants either individually or collectively manipulated various benchmark rates by
submitting rates that were artificially low or high. Plaintiffs allege that they transacted in loans, derivatives
or other financial instruments whose values are affected by
                                                        184                                                        
changes in these rates and assert a variety of claims including antitrust claims seeking treble damages. In actions
related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has resolved certain
of these actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The District Court dismissed certain claims,
including antitrust claims brought by some plaintiffs whom the District Court found did not have standing to assert
such claims, and permitted certain claims to proceed, including antitrust, Commodity Exchange Act, Section 10(b) of
the Securities Exchange Act and common law claims. The plaintiffs whose antitrust claims were dismissed for lack of
standing have filed an appeal. The District Court granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds
and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants and denied class certification motions filed by other
plaintiffs. In the consolidated putative class action related to the time period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss plaintiffs’
complaint, and the plaintiffs have appealed. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to Swiss
franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate (“SIBOR”), the Australian Bank
Bill Swap Reference Rate, and one of the putative class actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR remain subject to
court approval. In the class actions related to SIBOR and Swiss franc LIBOR, the District Court concluded that the
Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiffs’ appeals of those decisions are pending. In addition to
the actions pending or consolidated in the Southern District of New York, in August 2020, a group of individual
plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of California, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set LIBOR and
conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. The complaint seeks injunctive
relief and monetary damages. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and Litigation and Related Inquiries. The
Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had entered into resolutions with the U.S.
Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’ respective investigations relating to
historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related
conduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it
agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase & Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and
agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, to certain terms and obligations as
set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be dismissed after three years,
provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC fully comply with all
of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC, JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary amount of approximately $ 920million. A
portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments. Several putative class action
complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York against the
Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options price manipulation scheme in
violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment and deceptive acts or
practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class
actions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through May 2021. In addition, several putative
class actions have been filed in the United States District Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and
Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and
bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions
in the Northern District of Illinois have been transferred to the Southern District of New York. A putative class
action complaint has also been filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders
who acquired shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially
false or misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the above-referenced
investigations . Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of
transactions entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004
through 2007 to restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided
financing for the transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase has cooperated with the
investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris
Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of
Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an
ordonnance de renvoi and in January 2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel. Court of Appeal hearings are scheduled in November and December
2020 to further consider JPMorgan Chase’s
                                                        185                                                        
status in this matter. A trial of the managers of Wendel is due to commence before the tribunal correctionnel in
January 2021. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In
addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it
intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance
with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is
probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm
evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments
in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense/(benefit) was $ 524million and $ 10million for the three months ended September
30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $ 839million and $( 2) million for the nine months ended September 30, 2020
and 2019, respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in
the future. In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where
the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve
a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be
the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual
losses, fines, penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current
knowledge and after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and
after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses,
that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the
Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in
such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed
the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a
result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular
period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan
Chase’s income for that period.

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for a further discussion concerning JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment
results The following tables provide a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the
reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and
each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax
credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments
and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s
managed basis. Business segment capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business is referred to
as equity. Periodically, the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are assessed and as a result,
the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2019
Form 10-K for additional information on business segment capital allocation. Business segment changes In the first
quarter of 2020, the Firm began reporting a Wholesale Payments business unit within CIB following a realignment of
the Firm’s wholesale payments businesses. The Wholesale Payments business comprises: • Merchant Services, which was
realigned from CCB to CIB • Treasury Services and Trade Finance in CIB. Trade Finance was previously reported in
Lending in CIB. In connection with the alignment of Wholesale Payments, the assets, liabilities and headcount
associated with the Merchant Services business were realigned to CIB from CCB, and the revenue and expenses of the
Merchant Services business are reported across CCB, CIB and CB based primarily on client relationships. Prior
period amounts have been revised to reflect this realignment and revised allocation methodology.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from
marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the second quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain spend-based credit card reward costs from
marketing expense to be a reduction of card income, with no effect on net income. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan

  Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements                                                                
                                                                                                                   
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of September 30, 2020, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2020 and 2019 and the consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2020 and 2019, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “interim financial
statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware
of any material modifications that should be made to
the accompanying interim financial statements for them
to be in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2019, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in
our report dated February 25, 2020, we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements. In our opinion, the information set forth
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
information as of December 31, 2019, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been
derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

(a) In the third quarter of 2020, the Firm reclassified certain fair value option elected lending-related positions
from trading assets to loans and other assets. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.

(b) Represents securities which are tax-exempt for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

Credit derivatives : Financial instruments whose value
is derived from the credit risk associated with the
debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity)
which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to
transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

the cash flows or the value of the instrument in a
manner similar to a derivative. An instrument
containing such terms or features is referred to as a
“hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-
derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.”
For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that
contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the
host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to
redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative).
However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid
composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest
rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real
estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a
percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and
the appraised value of the collateral (i.e.,
residential real estate) securing the loan.
                                                                                                                   
  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.
                                                                                                                   
  Current estimated LTV ratio                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.
                                                                                                                   
  Combined LTV ratio                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio considering all available lien
positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to
present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
Management also uses this financial measure at the
segment level, because it believes this provides
information to enable investors to understand the
underlying operational performance and trends of the
particular business segment and facilitates a
comparison of the business segment with the
performance of competitors.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions
governed by that agreement to be terminated or
accelerated and settled through a single payment in a
single currency in the event of a default (e.g.,
bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or
securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin
when due).

Measurement alternative : Measures equity securities
without readily determinable fair values at cost less
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price
changes from an identical or similar investment of the
same issuer.

Merchant Services: offers merchants payment processing
capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and
analytics, and other payments services. Through
Merchant Services, merchants of all sizes can accept
payments via credit and debit cards and payments in
multiple currencies.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior
month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added
to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans
are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan
to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting
specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MSA: Metropolitan statistical areas

MSR : Mortgage servicing rights

NA : Data is not applicable or available for the
period presented.

NAV : Net Asset Value

Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-
offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average
retained loans for the reporting period.
                                                        194                                                        
Net interchange income includes the following
components:

• Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit
card issuers on sales transactions.

• Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points
earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards
programs generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate
for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and interest has been in default for a
period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both
well-secured and in the process of collection.
Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on
nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

OCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

OCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)

OPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit

OTC : “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative
contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled
bilaterally between two derivative counterparties,
where one or both counterparties is a derivatives
dealer.

OTC cleared : “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”:
Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central
clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty
is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.

OTTI : Other-than-temporary impairment

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and

undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant
deterioration in credit quality since origination, as
determined by the Firm.

PCI : “Purchased credit-impaired” loans represented
certain loans that were acquired and deemed to be
credit-impaired on the acquisition date. The
superseded FASB guidance allowed purchasers to
aggregate credit-impaired loans acquired in the same
fiscal quarter into one or more pools, provided that
the loans had common risk characteristics (e.g.,
product type, LTV ratios, FICO scores, past due
status, geographic location). A pool was then
accounted for as a single asset with a single
composite interest rate and an aggregate expectation
of cash flows.

PD: Probability of default

PDCF: Primary Dealer Credit Facility

Phishing : a type of social engineering cyberattack
received through email or online messages.

PPP: Paycheck Protection Program

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in client-
driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven
market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities
(including physical commodities inventories and
financial instruments that reference commodities).
Principal transactions revenue also includes certain
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to
hedge accounting and specified risk-management
activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

Reported basis: Financial statements prepared under
U.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-
equivalent adjustments.

of investment banking fees generated across the
industry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment
banking transactions in M&A, equity and debt
underwriting, and loan syndications. Source: Dealogic,

ROU assets: Right-of-use assets

RSU(s) : Restricted stock units

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Scored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that
predominantly include residential real estate loans,
credit card loans, auto loans to individuals and
certain small business loans.

S&P : Standard and Poors

SAR(s) : Stock appreciation rights

SCB : Stress capital buffer

SEC : U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission

Seed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in
products, such as mutual funds, with the intention of
ensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a
viable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its
shares, and allowing the manager to develop a track
record. After these goals are achieved, the intent is
to remove the Firm’s capital from the investment.

Shelf Deals: Shelf offerings are SEC provisions that
allow issuers to register for new securities without
selling the entire issuance at once. Since these
issuances are filed with the SEC but are not yet
priced in the market, they are not included in the
league tables until the actual securities are issued.

Single-name : Single reference-entities

SLR : Supplementary leverage ratio

SMBS: Stripped mortgage-backed securities

SOFR: Secured Overnight Financing Rate

SPEs : Special purpose entities

SPV: Special purpose vehicle

Structural interest rate risk: represents interest
rate risk of the non-trading assets and liabilities of
the Firm.

Structured notes : Structured notes are financial
instruments whose cash flows are linked to the
movement in one or more indexes, interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, commodities prices, prepayment
rates, or other market variables. The notes typically
contain embedded (but not separable or detachable)
derivatives. Contractual cash flows for principal,
interest, or both can vary in amount and timing
throughout the life of the note based on non-
traditional indexes or non-traditional uses of
traditional interest rates or indexes.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but
are currently on hold, which could be due to
bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial
and non-judicial states.

Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed
results, the total net revenue for each of the
business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-
equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities is presented in the managed results on a
basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities; the corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income
tax expense.

TBVPS: Tangible book value per share

TCE: Tangible common equity

TDR : “Troubled debt restructuring” is deemed to occur
when the Firm modifies the original terms of a loan
agreement by granting a concession to a borrower that

interest by the full faith and credit of the U.S.
government in the event of a default.

U.S. GAAP : Accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services
rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance
over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide
ranked funds.

A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating represents the next
35% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked
funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating and
represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked
funds. The “overall Morningstar rating” is derived
from a weighted average of the performance associated
with a fund’s three-, five- and ten-year (if
applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.
domiciled funds, separate star ratings are given at
the individual share class level. The Nomura “star
rating” is based on three-year risk-adjusted
performance only. Funds with fewer than three years of
history are not rated and hence excluded from this
analysis. All ratings, the assigned peer categories
and the asset values used to derive this
                                                        199                                                        
analysis are sourced from these fund rating providers.
The data providers re-denominate the asset values into
U.S. dollars. This % of AUM is based on star ratings
at the share class level for U.S. domiciled funds, and
at a “primary share class” level to represent the star
rating of all other funds except for Japan where
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The
“primary share class”, as defined by Morningstar,
denotes the share class recommended as being the best
proxy for the portfolio and in most cases will be the
most retail version (based upon annual management
charge, minimum investment, currency and other
factors). The performance data could have been
different if all funds/accounts would have been
included. Past performance is not indicative of future
results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three,
and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive
this analysis are sourced from the fund ranking
providers. Quartile rankings are done on the net-of-
fee absolute return of each fund. The data providers
re-denominate the asset values into U.S. dollars. This
% of AUM is based on fund performance and associated
peer rankings at the share class level for U.S.
domiciled funds, at a “primary share class” level to
represent the quartile ranking of the U.K., Luxembourg
and Hong Kong funds and at the fund level for all
other funds. The “primary share class”, as defined by
Morningstar, denotes the share class recommended as
being the best proxy for the portfolio and in most
cases will be the most retail version (based upon
annual management charge, minimum investment, currency
and other factors). Where peer group rankings given
for a fund are in more than one “primary share class”
territory both rankings are included to reflect local
market competitiveness (applies to “Offshore
Territories” and “HK SFC Authorized” funds only). The
performance data could have been different if all
funds/accounts would have been included. Past
performance is not indicative of future results.

│  Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as    │
│  defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934). Based on that evaluation, the Chairman   │
│  and Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that these disclosure controls and       │
│  procedures were effective. Refer to Exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 for the Certifications furnished by the Chairman    │
│  and Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively.The Firm is committed to maintaining     │
│  high standards of internal control over financial reporting. Nevertheless, because of its inherent             │
│  limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. In addition,   │
│  in a firm as large and complex as JPMorgan Chase, lapses or deficiencies in internal controls may occur from   │
│  time to time, and there can be no assurance that any such deficiencies will not result in significant          │
│  deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control in the future and collateral consequences therefrom.   │
│  Refer to “Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting” on page 142 of JPMorgan Chase’s    │
│  2019 Form 10-K for further information. There was no change in the Firm’s internal control over financial      │
│  reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) that occurred during the    │
│  three months ended September 30, 2020, that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially     │

│  our businesses.On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a strain of novel     │
│  coronavirus disease, COVID-19, a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and governmental responses to the      │
│  pandemic have had, and continue to have, a severe impact on global economic conditions,                        │
│  including:•significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets•disruption of global supply          │
│  chains•closures of many businesses, leading to loss of revenues and increased unemployment, and•the            │
│  institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in the U.S. and other countries.If the   │
│  pandemic is prolonged, or other diseases emerge that give rise to similar effects, the adverse impact on the   │
│  global economy could deepen.The continuation of the adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic can be  │
│  expected to have a significant adverse effect on JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations,        │
│  including:•significantly reduced demand for products and services from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and            │
│  customers•possible recognition of credit losses and increases in the allowance for credit losses, especially   │
│  if businesses remain closed, unemployment continues to rise and clients and customers draw on their lines of   │
│  credit•possible material impacts on the value of securities, derivatives and other financial instruments       │

• possible constraints on liquidity and capital,
whether due to increases in risk-weighted assets
related to supporting client activities or to
regulatory actions, and

• the possibility that significant portions of
JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work
effectively, including because of illness,
quarantines, sheltering-in-place arrangements,
government actions or other restrictions in connection
with the pandemic.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively
affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of
operations and financial condition, as well as its
regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend
on future developments that are highly uncertain and
cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration
of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental
authorities and other third parties in response to the
pandemic. Those negative effects, including the
recognition of charge-offs, may be delayed because of
the impact of prior and potential future government
stimulus actions or payment assistance provided to
clients and customers. In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s
participation directly or on behalf of customers and
clients in U.S. government programs designed to
support individuals, households and businesses
impacted by the economic disruptions caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic could be

criticized and subject JPMorgan Chase to increased
governmental and regulatory scrutiny, negative
publicity or increased exposure to litigation, which
could increase its operational, legal and compliance
costs and damage its reputation. To the extent the
COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s
business, results of operations and financial
condition, it may also have the effect of heightening
many of the other risks described in Risk Factors in
the 2019 Form 10-K.

Item 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and

Repurchases under the common equity repurchase program

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of
this Form 10-Q and pages 85-92 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2019 Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases
under the Firm’s common equity repurchase program.

On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19
pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases
of its common equity. In June 2020, the Federal
Reserve directed all large bank holding companies,
including the Firm, to discontinue net share
repurchases, at least through the end of the third
quarter of 2020. As such, there were no shares
repurchased during the second and third quarters of
2020. On September 30, 2020, the Federal Reserve
directed all large bank holding companies, including
the Firm, to extend the discontinuation of net share
repurchases through the end of the fourth quarter of
2020. Through the date of the filing of this Form
10-Q, the Firm has not authorized a stock repurchase
program as part of its annual capital plan.
