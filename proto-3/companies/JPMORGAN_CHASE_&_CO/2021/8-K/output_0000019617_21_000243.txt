Item 5.03. Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in Fiscal Year.

JPMorgan Chase’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) has adopted amendments to the Firm’s By-laws, effective March 16,
2021 (as so amended, the “By-laws”), primarily to update them in line with developments in Delaware General
Corporation Law, adopt the title of Chair in place of Chairman while allowing flexibility to utilize the term of
choice, clarify the roles of Lead Independent Director and President at stockholder and Board meetings in the
absence of the Chair, and make additional clarifying and conforming revisions.

The foregoing description of the amendments to the By-laws is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full
text of the Bylaws, a copy of which (marked to show changes from the prior version) is attached as Exhibit 3.2 and
incorporated by reference herein.
