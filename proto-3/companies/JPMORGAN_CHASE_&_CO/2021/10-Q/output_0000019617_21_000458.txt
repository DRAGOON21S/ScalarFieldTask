JPMorgan Chase reported net income of $11.7 billion
for the third quarter of 2021, or $3.74 per share, on
net revenue of $29.6 billion. The Firm reported ROE of
18% and ROTCE of 22%. The Firm's results for the third
quarter of 2021 included a reduction in the allowance
for credit losses of $2.1 billion and an income tax
benefit of $566 million related to finalizing the
Firm's 2020 U.S. federal tax return. The tax benefit
included state and local impacts of federal tax method
changes and a reduction in the valuation allowance for
U.S. foreign tax credits.

• Net income was $11.7 billion, up $2.2 billion.

• Total net revenue was up 1%.

– Noninterest revenue was $16.6 billion, up 2%, driven
by higher Investment Banking fees in CIB and asset
management fees in AWM, predominantly offset by net
investment securities losses in Corporate compared to
net gains in the prior year, and lower revenue in Home
Lending.

– Net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 1%, driven
by balance sheet growth and higher market rates,
predominantly offset by change in balance sheet mix
and lower net interest income in CIB Markets.

• Noninterest expense was $17.1 billion, up 1%, driven
by continued investments in the business, including
marketing and technology, and higher volume- and
revenue-related expense, predominantly offset by lower
legal expense and structural expense. Noninterest
expense for the prior year included an impairment on a
legacy investment.

• The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$1.5 billion, reflecting a net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses of $2.1 billion, driven by
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, and
$524 million of net charge-offs.

– The net reserve release in the current period
consisted of $1.2 billion in Wholesale and $874
million in Consumer, driven by $850 million in Card.

– Net charge-offs of $524 million declined $656
million, predominantly driven by Card.

The prior year provision was an expense of $611
million, reflecting $1.2 billion of net charge-offs
and a net reduction in the allowance for credit losses
of $569 million.
                                                         5                                                         
• The total allowance for credit losses was $20.5
billion at September 30, 2021. The Firm had an
allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage
ratio of 1.86%, compared with 2.02% in the second
quarter of 2021, and 3.26% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.9 billion
at September 30, 2021, a decrease of $2.6 billion from
the prior year, driven by:

– paydowns and upgrades in the wholesale portfolio,
across CB, CIB and AWM, and

– lower nonaccrual loans at fair value in the consumer
portfolio due to sales in CIB.

Nonperforming assets were down $920 million from June
30, 2021, driven by lower nonaccrual loans in the
wholesale and consumer portfolios, reflecting improved
credit performance and paydowns.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.0 trillion were up 5%
driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM, partially
offset by lower loans in CB and CCB.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up
19%, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs

  Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
("FCA") confirmed that the publication of the
principal tenors of the U.S. dollar London Interbank
Offered Rate ("LIBOR") (i.e., overnight, one-month,
three-month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) will cease
immediately following a final publication on June 30,
2023. The scheduled cessation date for U.K. sterling,
Japanese yen, Swiss franc and Euro LIBOR, and the one-
week and two-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR,
remains December 31, 2021. The Firm continues to
prioritize those currencies and tenors of LIBOR for
contract remediation and is finalizing its operational
readiness to support rate fallback mechanisms across
all products that reference IBORs for which
publication will cease on December 31, 2021.

The Firm continues to engage with clients to arrange
for the remediation of in-scope IBOR-linked contracts,
and to amend contracts with clients that are prepared
to do so. For example, substantially all of the
notional amounts of the Firm’s derivatives exposures
that are documented under bilateral agreements now
contain IBOR fallback provisions by virtue of
counterparty adherence to the 2020 International Swaps
and Derivatives Association, Inc.’s ("ISDA") IBOR
Fallbacks Protocol. The Firm is also prepared for the
conversion to alternative reference rates at various
central counterparties ("CCPs") scheduled for the
fourth quarter of 2021.

The Federal Reserve, the OCC and the FDIC have
encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts
that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by
December 31, 2021, and in connection with this, the
Firm now offers various floating rate products, and
provides and arranges various types of floating rate
debt financings, that reference the Secured Overnight
Financing Rate (“SOFR”) across its businesses.

The Firm continues to monitor the transition relief
being considered by the U.S. Treasury Department
regarding the tax implications of reference rate
reform and the legislative progress associated with
contracts or instruments that do not have satisfactory
rate fallback mechanisms and that cannot easily be
amended (e.g., certain floating rate debt securities,
securitizations and adjustable rate mortgages). Refer

Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for additional information.

Investment banking fees increased across products in
CIB, primarily reflecting:

• higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A
activity and wallet share gains, and

• higher equity underwriting fees due to wallet share
gains and increased activity in the IPO market.

Refer to C IB segment results on pages 29-34 and Note
5 for additional information.

Principal transactions revenue decreased, reflecting:

• lower revenue in CIB Fixed Income Markets across
products, particularly in Commodities, Rates and
Credit compared to a strong prior year, including an
adjustment to liquidity assumptions in the derivatives
portfolio; and

• net losses on certain legacy private equity
investments in Corporate, compared with net gains in
the prior year,

partially offset by

• higher revenue in CIB Equity Markets driven by
strong performance across prime brokerage, derivatives
and Cash equities.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB may in certain
cases have offsets across other revenue lines,
including net interest income. The Firm assesses the
performance of its CIB Markets business on a total
revenue basis.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34 and Note 5
for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased largely as
a result of higher cash management fees in CIB and CB.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 29-34 and CB on
pages 35-38, and Note 5 for additional information.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased driven by higher asset management
fees in AWM as a result of cumulative net inflows into
long-term products and higher average market levels,
net of liquidity fee waivers; and in CCB related to
the higher level of client investment assets on higher
average market levels and net inflows.

Refer to AWM and CCB segment results on pages 39-43,
and pages 24-28, respectively, and Note 5 for
additional information on asset management,
administration and commissions revenue.

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net
losses related to repositioning the investment
securities portfolio, compared with net gains in the
prior year from the sales of U.S. GSE and government
agency mortgage-backed securities ("MBS") . R efer to
Corporate segment results on pages 44-46 and Note 9
for additional information on investment securities
gains/(losses).

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a
net loss in MSR risk management results driven by
updates to model inputs, compared with a net gain in
the prior period, and
                                                        10                                                         
• lower mortgage production revenue reflecting lower
production margins, partially offset by higher
volumes.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28, Note 5
and 14 for additional information.

Card income decreased reflecting the amortization of
higher account origination costs, including
promotional offers. Net interchange was relatively
flat as the increase in debit and credit card sales
volume was offset by an increase to the rewards
liability. Refer to CCB segment results on pages
24-28, Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 86-88 ,
and Note 5 for additional information.

Other income in creased reflecting:

• higher gains on several investments, predominantly
in CIB, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to
derivatives in Other Corporate and the early
termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in
Treasury and CIO,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result
of the decline in volume.

Net interest income increased driven by balance sheet
growth and higher market rates, primarily offset by
change in balance sheet mix and lower net interest
income in CIB Markets.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2
trillion, up $345 billion, primarily driven by higher
deposits with banks, and the yield was 1.80%, down 25
basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets,
on an FTE basis, was 1.62%, a decrease of 20 bps. The
net yield excluding CIB Markets was 1.91%, down 14
bps.

Net yield on an FTE basis, and n et yield excluding
CIB Markets, are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
the Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and
rates schedule on page 183 for further details; and

of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21 for a
further discussion of Net interest yield excluding CIB
Markets.
                                                                                                                   
  Year-to-date results                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Investment banking fees increased across products in
CIB, reflecting:

• higher advisory fees driven by increased M&A
activity and wallet share gains

• higher equity under writing fees due to increased
activity and wallet share gains in the IPO market, and

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by an active
leveraged loan market primarily related to acquisition
financing.

Principal transactions revenue decreased driven by
CIB, reflecting:

• lower revenue in Fixed Income Markets, primarily in
Rates, Currencies & Emerging Markets, and Commodities
compared to a strong prior year, and an increase in
Securitized Products,

partially offset by

• higher revenue in Equity Markets driven by strong
performance across derivatives, prime brokerage, and
Cash Equities,

• favorable results in Credit Adjustments & Other,
with a net gain of $338 million largely driven by
valuation adjustments related to derivatives, compared
with a $272 million net loss, in the prior year,
predominantly driven by losses on certain components
of fair-value option elected liabilities, as well as
the impact of funding spread widening on derivatives;
and

• the absence of losses in Treasury and CIO related to
cash deployment transactions in the prior year, which
were more than offset by the related net interest
income earned on these transactions.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased as a
result of:

• higher cash management fees in CIB and CB, and
higher len ding-related fees, particularly loan
commitment fees in CIB,

predominantly offset by

• lower overdraft fees in CCB.

Asset management, administration and commissions
revenue increased driven by:

• higher asset management fees in AWM as a result of
strong cumulative net inflows into long-term and
liquidity products and higher average market levels,
net of liquidity fee waivers; and in CCB related to
the higher level of client investment assets on higher
average market levels and net inflows, and

• higher custody fees in CIB Securities Services,
primarily associated with the higher level of assets
under custody .

Investment securities gains/(losses) reflected net
losses related to repositioning the investment
securities portfolio, compared with net gains in the
prior year from the sales of U.S. GSE and government
agency MBS.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased due to:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a
net loss in MSR risk management results driven by
updates to model inputs, compared with a net gain in
the prior year,

partially offset by

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher
production volumes.

Card income increased due to higher net interchange
income and merchant processing fees reflecting the
acceleration of debit and credit card sales volume
above pre-pandemic levels, and lower amortization
costs related to new account originations.

Other income increased reflecting:

• gains on several investments compared with losses in
the prior year, primarily in CIB, and higher gains in
AWM, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to
the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-
term debt in Treasury and CIO, and derivatives in
Other Corporate,
                                                        11                                                         
predominantly offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB as a result
of the decline in volume, and

• increased amortization on a higher level of
alternative energy investments in the tax-oriented
investment portfolio in CIB. The increased
amortization was more than offset by lower income tax
expense from the associated tax credits. Additionally,
the first quarter of 2021 included weather-related
write-downs on certain renewable energy investments.

Net interest income decreased predominantly driven by
the impact of lower market rates and change in balance
sheet mix, partially offset by balance sheet growth.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2
trillion, up $454 billion, predominantly driven by
higher deposits with banks and investment securities,
and the yield was 1.82%, down 65 bps. The net yield on
these assets, on an FTE basis, was 1.64%, a decrease
of 40 bps. The net yield excluding CIB Markets was
1.92%, down 49 bps.

The provision for credit losses decreased driven by
net reductions in the allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in wholesale reflected a net reduction of
$1.2 billion in the allowance for credit losses,
predominantly in CIB and CB. The prior year included a
$270 million net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses.

The decrease in consumer was driven by:

• an $874 million reduction in the allowance for
credit losses, in particular $850 million in Card
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card as
consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting
from the residual impact of government stimulus and
payment assistance programs;

• the prior year included a $396 million reduction in
the allowance for credit losses.

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28, CIB on
pages 29-34, CB on pages 35-38, AWM on pages 39-43,

Notes 9 and 12 for additional information on the
credit portfolio and the allowance for credit losses.

The provision for credit losses decreased driven by
net reductions in the allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in consumer was driven by:

• an $8.0 billion reduction in the allowance for
credit losses, including $6.2 billion in Card
reflecting improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic
outlook, and $1.2 billion in Home Lending primarily
due to continued improvements in Home Price Index
("HPI") expectations, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as
consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting
from the impact of government stimulus and payment
assistance programs;

• the prior year included an $8.3 billion addition to
the allowance for credit losses.

The decrease in wholesale reflects a net reduction of
$2.3 billion in the allowance for credit losses across
the LOBs, reflecting improvements in the Firm's
macroeconomic outlook. The prior year included a $6.7
billion net addition to the allowance for credit
losses.

Compensation expense increased driven by higher
performance-related compensation largely in AWM and
CCB, and the impact of investments in the businesses.

Noncompensation expense decreased as a result of:

• lower legal expense, predominantly in CIB

• the absence of an impairment in the prior year on a
legacy investment in Corporate, and

• lower depreciation expense in CCB on lower auto
lease assets and the impact of higher vehicle
collateral values,

largely offset by

• higher volume-related brokerage expense in CIB and
distribution fees in AWM

• higher marketing expense, predominantly in CCB,
associated with higher investments in marketing
campaigns and travel-related benefits

• higher other investments, including technology.

Compensation expense increased driven by higher
performance-related compensation across the LOBs, and
the impact of investments in the businesses.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of:

• higher volume-related brokerage expense in CIB and
distribution fees in AWM

• higher marketing expense in CCB associated with
higher investments in marketing campaigns and travel-
related benefits

• higher contribution expense, which included a $550
million donation of equity investments to the Firm's
Foundation in the first quarter of 2021

• higher other investments, including technology, and

• higher FDIC and other regulatory-related expense,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense in CCB on lower auto
lease assets and the impact of higher vehicle
collateral values

• lower legal expense, driven by CIB, and

• the absence of an impairment, in the prior year, on
a legacy investment in Corporate.

T h e effective tax rate for the current period was
17.2%, and reflected an income tax benefit of $566
million related to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S.
federal tax return. The tax benefit included state and
local impacts of federal tax method changes and a
reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. foreign
tax credits.

The prior year effective tax rate was 19.8% and also
reflected an income tax benefit related to prior year
returns.

Both periods reflected the impact of the level and mix
of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state
and local taxes.

The effective tax rate for the current period was
19.1% and reflected an income tax benefit of $566
million related to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S.
federal tax return, largely offset by the resolution
of certain tax audits. The tax benefit included state
and local impacts of federal tax method changes and a
reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. foreign
tax credits.

The prior year effective tax rate was 17.7% and
included a benefit related to prior year returns and
the higher impact of certain tax benefits due to the
lower level of pre-tax income.

Both periods reflected the impact of the level and mix
of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal, state
and local taxes .

(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform
with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for
further information.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
increased primarily as a result of the continued
growth in deposits and limited deployment
opportunities in Treasury and CIO. Deposits with banks
reflect the Firm’s placements of its excess cash with
various central banks, including the Federal Reserve
Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements decreased driven by:

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO, and
lower client-driven market-making activities in CIB
Markets,

partially offset by

• higher demand for securities to cover short
positions in CIB Markets.

Securities borrowed increased reflecting higher
client-driven activities, and an increase in the
demand for securities to cover short positions in CIB
Markets.

Refer Note 10 for additional information on securities
purchased under resale agreements and securities
borrowed.

Trading assets increased reflecting;

• client-driven market-making activities in equity
instruments, predominantly in CIB prime brokerage,

partially offset by

• lower derivative receivables, primarily driven by
maturities of certain trades in CIB, and

• lower deployment of funds in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities in creased due to purchases and
paydowns in held-to-maturity ("HTM") securities,
partially offset by paydowns and net purchases in
available-for-sale ("AFS") securities. In the second
quarter of 2021, AFS securities of $104.5 billion were
transferred to the HTM portfolio for capital
management purposes. Refer to Corporate segment
results on pages 44-46, Investment Portfolio Risk
Management on page 77, and Notes 2 and 9 for
additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting :

• higher secured lending in CIB Markets; and higher
securities-based lending, mortgages, as well as custom
lending in AWM,

partially offset by

• lower loans in CBB and CB primarily driven by the
impact of PPP forgiveness; and lower retained
residential real estate loans in Home Lending
primarily due to net paydowns.

The allowance for loan losses decreased, consisting
of:

• a $7.9 billion reduction in consumer, predominantly
in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements
in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and in the
residential real estate portfolio, primarily due to
continued improvements in HPI expectations , and

• a $2.3 billion net reduction in wholesale, across
the LOBs, reflecting improvements in the Firm's
macroeconomic outlook.

There was a $104 million net reduction in the
allowance for lending-related commitments, driven by
both wholesale and consumer. This allowance is
included in other liabilities on the consolidated
balance sheets. The total net reduction in
                                                        16                                                         
the allowance for credit losses was $10.3 billion, as
of September 30, 2021.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 59-77, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for a more
detailed discussion of loans and the allowance for
loan losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased due
to higher client receivables related to client-driven
activities primarily in CIB prime brokerage.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased
reflecting:

• higher MSRs as a result of net additions, partially
offset by the realization of expected cash flows; and

• an increase in Goodwill as a result of the
acquisitions of Nutmeg, OpenInvest, Frank and Campbell
Global.

Refer to Note 14 for additional information.

Other assets increased due to the higher cash
collateral placed with central counterparties ("CCPs")
in CIB, and higher tax receivables. Refer to Note 10
for additional information on securities financing
transactions.

(a) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform
with the current presentation. Refer to Note 1 for
further information.

Deposits increased across the LOBs primarily driven by
the effect of certain government actions in response
to the COVID 19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was
also driven by growth from existing and new accounts
across both consumer and small business customers.
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-58 and
Notes 2 and 15 for additional information.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased reflecting:

• the impact of client activities and secured
financing of trading assets in CIB Markets,

partially offset by

• lower secured financing of AFS investment securities
in Treasury and CIO.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-58 and
Note 10 for additional information.

Short-term borrowings increased predominantly as a
result of higher financing of prime brokerage
activities in CIB. Refer to pages 54-58 for
information on changes in Liquidity Risk Management.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven
market-making activities in CIB Fixed Income Markets,
which resulted in higher levels of short positions in
debt instruments, partially offset by lower derivative
payables largely as a result of market movements.
Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased
reflecting higher client payables related to client-
driven activities primarily in CIB prime brokerage.
Refer to Note 10 for additional information on
securities financing transactions.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
decreased driven by maturities of credit card
securitizations in Treasury and CIO, as well as lower
issuances of commercial paper as a result of lower
loan balances in the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits in CIB. Refer to Off-Balance Sheet
Arrangements on page 19 and Notes 13 and 22 for
additional information on Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances,
partially offset by fair value hedge accounting
adjustments related to higher rates. Refe r to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-58 for
additional information.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income,
partially offset by the net impact of capital actions,
and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
income (“AOCI”). The decrease in AOCI was driven by
the impact of higher rates on the AFS securities
portfolio and cash flow hedges. Refer to page 94 for
information on changes in stockholders’ equity,
Capital actions on pages 51-52, and Note 19 for
additional information on AOCI.

Operating activities • In 2021, cash used resulted from higher securities borrowed and accrued interest and
accounts receivable, partially offset by higher accounts payable and other liabilities. • In 2020, cash used
resulted from higher trading assets and other assets, partially offset by higher trading liabilities and accounts
payable and other liabilities. Investing activities • In 2021, cash used resulted from net loan originations and
net purchases of investment securities, partially offset by lower securities purchased under resale agreements. •
In 2020, cash used resulted from net purchases of investment securities and higher securities purchased under
resale agreements.

Financing activities • In 2021, cash provided reflected higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. • In 2020, cash provided reflected
higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, partially offset by net paydowns of
long- and short-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash
dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 16-17,

  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  
                                  
In the normal course of business, the Firm enters into various off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual
obligations that may require future cash payments. Certain obligations are recognized on-balance sheet, while
others are disclosed as off-balance sheet under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).
                                                                                                                   
  Special-purpose entities                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
The Firm has several types of off–balance sheet arrangements, including through nonconsolidated special-purpose
entities (“SPEs”), which are a type of VIE, and through lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments
and guarantees).

The Firm holds capital, as appropriate, against all SPE-related transactions and related exposures, such as
derivative contracts and lending-related commitments and guarantees.

The Firm has no commitments to issue its own stock to support any SPE transaction, and its policies require that
transactions with SPEs be conducted at arm’s length and reflect market pricing.

The table below provides an index of where in this Form 10-Q discussions of the Firm’s various off-balance sheet
arrangements can be found. Refer to Note 1 for additional information about the Firm’s consolidation policies.

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 91-95.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis)

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense

• Net interest income and net yield excluding CIB
Markets

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 62–64 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

The following summary tables provide a reconciliation

basis.

  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
                            
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four
major reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In
addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 20-21 for a definition of managed
basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least
an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various
business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and
its investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products
and services to the Firm’s clients, the participating
business segments may agree to share revenue from
those transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in
the segment responsible for the related product or
service, with allocations to the other segment(s)
involved in the transaction. The segment results
reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing is the process by which the
Firm allocates interest income and expense to each
business segment and transfers the primary interest
rate risk and liquidity risk exposures to Treasury and
CIO within Corporate. The funds transfer pricing
process considers the interest rate risk, liquidity
risk and regulatory requirements on a product-by-
product basis within each business segment.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each segment is
referred to as equity. Periodically, the assumptions
and methodologies used to allocate capital are
reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to
the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity
on page 51, and page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 65–66
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of those methodologies.

Net income was $4.3 billion, up 12%, driven by a
decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, a decrease of 3%.

Net interest income was $8.4 billion, up 4%, driven
by:

• growth in deposits net of margin compression as well
as the impacts from PPP including the accelerated
recognition of deferred processing fees due to loan
forgiveness in CBB, lower prepayments in Home Lending,
higher auto loans, an d lower funding costs in Card,

partially offset by

• lower revolving loans in Card due to the impact of
higher payments and lower cumulative sales volume
throughout 2020.

Noninterest revenue was $4.1 billion, down 15%, driven
by:

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue reflecting a
net loss in MSR risk management results driven by
updates to model inputs, compared with a net gain in
the prior period,

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of the
decline in volume,

• lower card income reflecting the amortization of
higher account origination costs, including
promotional offers, while net interchange was
relatively flat as the increase in debit and credit
card sales volume was offset by an increase to the
rewards liability, and

• lower mortgage production revenue reflecting the net
impact of lower production margins and higher volumes,
                                                        24                                                         
partially offset by

• higher asset management fees related to the higher
level of client investment assets on higher average
market levels and net inflows.

Refer to Note 14 for further information regarding
changes in the value of the MSR asset and related
hedges, and mortgage fees and related income. Refer to
Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 86-88 , and
Note 5 for additional information on card income.

Noninterest expense was $7.2 billion, up 5%, driven
by:

• continued investments in the business, including
marketing expense reflecting increases in marketing
campaigns and travel-related benefits,

• higher expense reflecting growth across the
businesses, including performance-related
compensation,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets and
the impact of higher vehicle collateral values.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$459 million, compared with an expense of $795 million
in the prior year, driven by:

• a $950 million reduction in the allowance for credit
losses, reflecting improvements in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook consisting of $850 million in
Card and $100 million in CBB, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as
consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting
from the residual impact of government stimulus and
payment assistance programs.

The prior year included a $300 million reduction in
the allowance for credit losses.

pages 59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
75-76 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

Net income was $16.7 billion, up $12.8 billion, driven
by a decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $37.8 billion, a decrease of 2%.

Net interest income was $24.3 billion, down 4%, driven
by:

• lower revolving loans in Card due to the impact of
higher payments and lower cumulative sales volume
throughout 2020 and the net impact of deposit margin
compression and growth in CBB ,

largely offset by

• lower funding costs in Card related to changes in
portfolio mix and the impacts from PPP including the
accelerated recognition of deferred processing fees
due to loan forgiveness in CBB.

Noninterest revenue was $13.5 billion, up 2%, driven
by:

• higher card income due to higher net interchange
income reflecting the acceleration of debit and credit
c ard sales volume in 2021, above pre-pandemic levels,
and lower amortization costs related to new account
originations ,

• higher asset management fees related to the higher
level of client investment assets on higher average
market levels and net inflows, and

• higher mortgage production revenue reflecting higher
production volumes,

offset by

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue as a result of
a net loss in MSR risk management results driven by
updates to model inputs, compared with a net gain in
the prior period,

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of the
decline in volume, and

• lower overdraft fees.

Noninterest expense was $21.5 billion, up 3%,
reflecting:

• continued investments in the business, including
marketing expense reflecting increases in marketing
campaigns and travel-related benefits,

• higher expense reflecting growth across the
businesses, including performance-related
compensation,

largely offset by

• lower depreciation from lower auto lease assets and
the impact of higher vehicle collateral values

• lower structural expenses.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$5.9 billion, compared with an expense of $12.4
billion in the prior year, driven by:

• an $8.2 billion reduction in the allowance for
credit losses, driven by improvements in the Firm’s
macroeconomic outlook, consisting of $6.2 billion in
Card, $1.2 billion in Home Lending, primarily due to
continued improvements in HPI expectations, $575
million in CBB and $225 million in Auto, and

• lower net charge-offs predominantly in Card, as
consumer cash balances remained elevated benefiting
from the impact of government stimulus and payment
assistance programs.

(a) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $355 million and $851 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee.

pandemic. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 61-65 for further information on consumer payment assistance
activity. Includes loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90 or
more days past due, predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(c) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, included $11.1 billion and $20.3 billion of loans, respectively, in Business
Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans
are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 60 for a further discussion of the PPP.

deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic were as follows: (1) $3.1 billion and $10.2 billion
in Home Lending, respectively; (2) $53 million and $368 million in Card, respectively; and (3) $112 million and
$411 million in Auto, respectively. Loans that are performing according to their modified terms are generally not
considered delinquent. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 61-65 for further information on consumer
payment assistance activity.

(f) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $432 million and
$1.1 billion, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee.

Quarterly results

Net income was $5.6 billion, up 29% and includes a net
benefit in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $12.4 billion, up 7%.

Banking revenue was $4.9 billion, up 30%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $3.0 billion, up 45%,
driven by higher Investment Banking fees, up 52%,
reflecting higher advisory and equity underwriting
fees.

– Advisory fees were $1.2 billion, up 187%, driven by
increased M&A activity and wallet share gains.

– Equity underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, up 41%,
driven by wallet share gains and increased activity in
the IPO market.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.0 billion, up 3%,
driven by an active leveraged loan market primarily
related to acquisition financing.

• Wholesale Payments revenue was $1.6 billion, up 22%,
and included gains on equity investments. Excluding
these gains, revenue was $1.5 billion, up 10%, driven
by higher deposit balances and fees, partially offset
by deposit margin compression.

• Lending revenue was $244 million, down 27%, driven
by lower net interest income.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $7.5
billion, down 4%. Markets revenue was $6.3 billion,
down 5%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $3.7 billion, down
20%, driven by lower revenue in Commodities, Rates and
Spread products compared to a strong prior year,
including an adjustment to liquidity assumptions in
the derivatives portfolio.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.6 billion, up 30%,
driven by strong performance across prime brokerage,
derivatives, and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.1 billion, up 9%,
driven by growth in fees and deposit balances.

Noninterest expense was $5.9 billion, relatively flat
to the prior year, as higher structural expense,
volume- and revenue- related expense and investments
in the business, including technology and front office
hires, were offset by lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$638 million, driven by a net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses, compared with a net
benefit of $81 million in the prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
75-76 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

according to Dealogic.

– Advisory fees were $2.8 billion, up 84%, driven by
increased M&A activity and wallet share gains.

– Equity underwriting fees were $3.2 billion, up 54%,

higher loan commitment fees.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $25.7
billion, down 3%. Markets revenue was $22.1 billion,
down 6%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $13.5 billion, down
20%, driven by lower revenue in Rates, Currencies &
Emerging Markets, Fixed Income Financing and
Commodities compared to a strong prior year, partially
offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products.

• Equity Markets revenue was $8.6 billion, up 30%,
driven by strong performance across derivatives, prime
brokerage, and Cash Equities.

• Securities Services revenue was $3.3 billion, up 2%,
with growth in deposits and fees, predominantly offset
by deposit margin compression.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $338
million largely driven by valuation adjustments
related to derivatives. The prior year loss of $272
million was predominantly driven by losses on certain
components of fair value option elected liabilities,
as well as the impact of funding spread widening on
derivatives.

Noninterest expense was $19.5 billion, up 5%,
predominantly driven by higher volume- and revenue-
related expense, largely performance-related
compensation, as well as higher structural expense,
partially offset by lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$1.0 billion, driven by a net reduction in the

(a) Allowance for loan losses of $138 million and $320 million were held against these nonaccrual loans at
September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $289 million and $297 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee.

(c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate.

(e) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, a
non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio.

The following table summarizes select income statement
data for the Markets businesses. Markets includes both
Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Markets
revenue comprises principal transactions, fees,
commissions and other income, as well as net interest
income. The Firm assesses its Markets business
performance on a total revenue basis, as offsets may
occur across revenue line items. For example,
securities that generate net interest income may be
risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.
Refer to Markets revenue on page 74 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the predominant
source of principal transactions revenue was the
amount recognized upon executing new transactions.

Net income was $1.4 billion, up 30%, largely driven by
a decrease in the provision for credit losses.

Net revenue was $2.5 billion, up 10%. Net interest
income was $1.5 billion, up 1%, driven by the impact
of lower funding costs on loans and higher deposit
balances, largely offset by deposit margin
compression. Noninterest revenue was $988 million, up
30%, driven by higher investment banking revenue and
wholesale payments revenue.

Noninterest expense was $1.0 billion, up 7%,
predominantly driven by higher investments in the
business and higher volume- and revenue- related
expense.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$363 million, driven by a net reduction in the
allowance for credit losses, compared with a net
benefit of $147 million in the prior year.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 59-77 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
75-76 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

(a) In the first quarter of 2021, the Wealth Management business was renamed Global Private Bank. In the fourth
quarter of 2020, certain wealth management clients were transferred from AWM Global Private Bank to the J.P. Morgan
Wealth Management unit in CCB’s Consumer & Business Banking business. For further information see page 80 of the
2020 Form 10-K.

Net income was $1.2 billion, up 36%.

Net revenue was $4.3 billion, up 21%. Net interest
income was $988 million, up 21%. Noninterest revenue
was $3.3 billion, up 21%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.3 billion, up
21%, predominantly driven by:

• higher asset management fees on cumulative net
inflows into long-term products and higher average
market levels, net of liquidity fee waivers; and
higher performance fees.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.0 billion, up
20%, predominantly driven by:

• higher deposit and loan balances, higher asset
management fees, as well as the impact of lower
funding costs on loans, partially offset by deposit
margin compression.

Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, up 13%
predominantly driven by higher performance-related
compensation, distribution fees, and structural
expense.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $5.7 billion, up 16%, predominantly driven by: • higher deposit and loan
balances, higher asset management fees, as well as the impact of lower funding costs on loans, partially offset by
deposit margin compression. Noninterest expense was $7.9 billion, an increase of 10%, predominantly driven by
performance-related compensation and distribution fees. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $191
million, driven by a reduction in the allowance for credit losses, compared with an expense of $265 million in the
prior year.
                                                      
  Asset Management has two high-level measures of     
  its overall fund performance.                       
  Effective September 2021, AWM changed the source    
  for the peer group quartile rankings of its funds   
  from Lipper to Morningstar for U.S.-domiciled       
  funds (except for “Municipals” and “Investor”       
  funds, for which the source remains Lipper) and     
  Taiwan domiciled funds. AWM evaluates fund          
  performance utilizing this peer group ranking and   
  believes that it provides investors with            
  comparability across the industry. This change      
  resulted in positive impacts on the quartile        
  rankings shown in the following table, and both     
  positive and negative impacts on the quartile       
  rankings for prior periods, as compared to how      
  they would have been ranked by Lipper. In           
  addition, AWM has changed its selection of the      
  “primary share class” for certain non-U.S. funds,   
  as set forth below, in order to establish a more    
  consistent approach across these products. Prior    
  periods in the following table have been revised    
  to conform to the current presentation.             
  •Percentage of mutual fund assets under management  
  in funds rated 4- or 5-star:                        
  Mutual fund rating services rank funds based on     
  their risk-adjusted performance over various        
  periods. A 5-star rating is the best rating and     
  represents the top 10% of industry-wide ranked      
  funds. A 4-star rating represents the next 22.5%    
  of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating      
  represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked     
  funds. A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5%    
  of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is   
  the worst rating and represents the bottom 10% of   
  industry-wide ranked funds. An overall Morningstar  
  rating is derived from a weighted average of the    
  performance associated with a fund’s three-, five-  
  and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating    
  metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star    
  ratings are provided at the individual share class  
  level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on         
  three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds    
  with fewer than three years of history are not      
  rated and hence excluded from these rankings. All   
  ratings, the assigned peer categories and the       
  asset values used to derive these rankings are      
  sourced from the applicable fund rating provider.   
  Where applicable, the fund rating providers         
  redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The    
  percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the   
  share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at  
  a “primary share class” level to represent the      
  star rating of all other funds, except for Japan,   
  for which Nomura provides ratings at the fund       
  level. The performance data may have been           
  different if all share classes had been included.   
  Past performance is not indicative of future        
  results.                                            
  •Percentage of mutual fund assets under management  
  in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one,    
  three and five years):                              
  All quartile rankings, the assigned peer            
  categories and the asset values used to derive      
  these rankings are sourced from the fund rating     
  providers. Quartile rankings are based on the       
  net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where      
  applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate  
  asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of   
  AUM is based on fund performance and associated     
  peer rankings at the share class level for          
  U.S.-domiciled funds, at a “primary share class”    
  level to represent the quartile ranking for U.K.,   
  Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and at the fund      
  level for all other funds. The performance data     
  may have been different if all share classes had    
  been included. Past performance is not indicative   
  of future results.                                  
  “Primary share class” means the C share class for   
  European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong    
  and Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not    
  available, the oldest share class is used as the    
  primary share class.

the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) During the six months ended June 30, 2021, 1,155 technology and risk management employees were transferred from

Net loss was $817 million compared with a net loss of
$699 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $1.3 billion, down $957
million, driven by:

• limited deployment opportunities as deposit growth
continued,

• net investment securities losses related to
repositioning the investment securities portfolio,
compared with net gains in the prior year from the
sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and

• net losses on certain legacy private equity
investments, compared with net gains in the prior
year,

partially offset by

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to
derivatives in Other Corporate and the early
termination of certain of the Firm's long-term debt in
Treasury and CIO

Noninterest expense of $160 million was down $559
million primarily driven by the absence of an
impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year
and lower structural expense.

The current period income tax benefit was
predominantly driven by an income tax benefit of $383
million related to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S.
federal tax return and the change in the level and mix
of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal and
state and local taxes.
                                                                                                                   
   Year-to-date results                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
Net loss was $2.6 billion compared with a net loss of
$1.4 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was a loss of $2.9 billion, compared with
a loss of $927 million in the prior year, primarily
driven by lower net interest income on limited
deployment opportunities as deposit growth continued.

Noninterest revenue decreased primarily due to:

• net investment securities losses related to
repositioning the investment securities portfolio,
compared with net gains in the prior year from the
sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS,

predominantly offset by

• the absence of losses in Treasury and CIO related to
cash deployment transactions in the prior year, which
were
                                                        44                                                         
more than offset by the related net interest income
earned on these transactions, and

• the absence of losses in the prior year related to
the early termination of certain of the Firm's long-
term debt in Treasury and CIO and derivatives in Other
Corporate

Noninterest expense of $1.6 billion was up $539
million primarily due to a higher contribution to the
Firm's Foundation and higher legal and technology
expense, partially offset by the absence of an
impairment on a legacy investment in the prior year.

The current period income tax benefit was driven by
the change in the level and mix of income and expenses
subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes, the
impact of the Firm's estimated full-year expected tax
rate relative to the level of year-to-date pretax
income, as well as an income tax benefit of $383
million related to finalizing the Firm's 2020 U.S.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its businesses, and the associated risks, in
a manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors and protects the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • Firmwide
structures for risk governance. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance and oversight
framework The Firm’s risk management governance and
oversight framework involves understanding drivers of
risks, types of risks, and impacts of risks. Refer to
pages 85-89 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of Firmwide risk management
governance and oversight.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies ("BHCs") and banks, including the Firm and
its insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held
by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-
weighted assets (“RWA”), which are on-balance sheet
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted
according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-
based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm
is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
minimum capital ratios.

The Firm’s Basel III Standardized-risk-based ratios
are currently more binding than the Basel III
Advanced-risk-based ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approach banking organizations, including the Firm, to
calculate the SLR. The Firm’s SLR is currently more
binding than the Basel III Standardized-risk-based
ratios. Refer to SLR on page 51 for additional
information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition delay. As part of
their response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
the federal banking agencies issued a final rule that
provided the option beginning January 1, 2020 to delay
the effects of CECL on regulatory capital for two
years, followed by a

three-year transition period beginning January 1, 2022
(“CECL capital transition provisions”).

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital
transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period
ended September 30, 2021, the capital metrics of the
Firm exclude $3.3 billion, which is the $2.7 billion
day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $1.9
billion increase in the allowance for credit losses
from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances on PCD
loans).

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions
have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital,
adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure.
Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 91-101 and
Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and
the CECL accounting guidance.

PPP. On April 13, 2020, the federal banking agencies
issued an interim final rule (issued as final on
September 29, 2020) to neutralize the regulatory
capital effects of participating in the PPP on risk-
based capital ratios by applying a zero percent risk
weight to loans originated under the program. The Firm
does not expect to realize material credit losses on
PPP loans because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA.
As of September 30, 2021, the Firm had approximately
$13 billion of loans remaining under the program.

Total leverage exposure for purposes of calculating
the SLR includes PPP loans as the Firm did not
participate in the Federal Reserve’s Paycheck
Protection Program Lending Facility, which would have
allowed the Firm to exclude them under the final rule.

TLAC Holdings rule . On October 20, 2020, the federal
banking agencies issued a final rule prescribing the
regulatory capital treatment for holdings of Total
Loss-Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC") debt instruments by
certain large banking organizations, such as the Firm
and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. This rule expands the
scope of the existing capital deductions rule around
the holdings of capital instruments of financial
institutions to also include TLAC debt instruments
issued by systemically important banking
organizations. The final rule became effective April
1, 2021 and did not have a material impact on the
Firm’s risk-based capital metrics.

Capital actions Common stock dividends On September
21, 2021, the Firm announced that its Board of
Directors had declared a quarterly common stock
dividend, which increased to $1.00 per share from
$0.90 per share, effective with the dividend payable
on October 31, 2021. The Firm’s dividends are subject
to approval by the Board of Directors on a quarterly
basis. Common stock On December 18, 2020, the Federal
Reserve announced that all large banks, including the
Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the
first quarter of 2021. Subsequently, the Firm
announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program for up to $30 billion.
As directed by the Federal Reserve, total net
repurchases and common stock dividends in the first
and second quarters of 2021 were restricted and could
not exceed the average of the Firm’s net income for
the four preceding calendar quarters. On June 24,
2021, the Federal Reserve announced that the temporary
restrictions on capital distributions would expire on
June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm remaining above
its minimum risk-based capital requirements under the
2021 Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review
("CCAR") stress test. Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm
became subject
                                                        51                                                         
to the normal capital distribution restrictions
provided under the regulatory capital framework. The
Firm continues to be authorized to repurchase common
shares under its existing common share repurchase
program previously approved by the Board of Directors.

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the economic
disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm
temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock.

testing Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review On
June 28, 2021, JPMorgan Chase announced that it had
completed the 2021 CCAR stress test process. On August
5, 2021, the Federal Reserve affirmed the Firm's 2021
Stress Capital Buffer ("SCB") requirement of 3.2%
(down from 3.3%) and the Firm's minimum Standardized
CET1 capital ratio of 11.2% (down from 11.3%). The
2021 SCB requirement became effective on October 1,
2021 and will remain in effect until September 30,
2022. Refer to Capital planning and stress testing on
pages 91-92 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its contractual and contingent
financial obligations as they arise or that it does
not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor
of funding and liquidity to support its assets and
liabilities. Refer to pages 102–108 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR
Disclosure reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website for a further discussion of the Firm’s
Liquidity Risk Management. LCR and HQLA The LCR rule
requires that the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
maintain an amount of eligible HQLA that is sufficient
to meet their respective estimated total net cash
outflows over a prospective 30 calendar-day period of
significant stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of
eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that
is in excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR
requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank
affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.
Refer to page 103 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for
additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.
(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading
assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess eligible
HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The Firm’s average LCR
increased during the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the three-month period ended June 30,
2021, primarily due to an

increase in cash from long-term debt issuances during the second quarter 2021. The Firm's average LCR decreased
during the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the prior year period primarily due to the relative
impact on net cash outflows from the significant increase in deposits. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR
increased during the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with both the three month periods ended June
30, 2021 and September 30, 2020 primarily due to growth in deposits. Deposits continued to increase in the third
quarter primarily driven by the effect of certain government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The
increase in excess liquidity in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is excluded from the Firm’s reported LCR under the LCR
rule. The Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period, due to changes in its
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Other liquidity sources In
addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities,
such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes
excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The
fair value of these securities was approximately $878 billion and $740 billion as of September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised would be dependent on
prevailing market conditions. The fair value increased compared to December 31, 2020, due to an increase in excess
eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. which was primarily a result of higher deposit s as well as an increase
in CIB trading assets . The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and
the discount window at the Federal Reserve Bank as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of
approximately $303 billion and $307 billion as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. This
borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or other
unencumbered securities that are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Bank discount window and other central
banks. Although available, the Firm does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Bank discount
window and the other central banks as a primary source of liquidity. NSFR The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is
a liquidity requirement for large banking organizations that is intended to measure the adequacy of “available” and
“required” amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon. On October 20, 2020, the federal banking agencies
                                                        54                                                         
issued a final NSFR rule under which large banking
organizations such as the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. will be required to maintain an NSFR of at
least 100% on an ongoing basis. The final NSFR rule
became effective on July 1, 2021, and the Firm will be
required to publicly disclose its quarterly average
NSFR semi-annually beginning in 2023.

As of September 30, 2021, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. are compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR,
based on the Firm's current understanding of the final
rule.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may also
access funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, through the issuance of

unsecured long-term debt, or from borrowings from the
Parent Company or the Intermediate Holding Company
(“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are
primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings
and short-term secured borrowings, primarily
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.
Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in
cash or other short-term liquid investments based on
their interest rate and liquidity risk
characteristics.

Deposits provide a stable source of funding and reduce
the Firm’s reliance on the wholesale funding markets.
A significant portion of the Firm’s deposits are
consumer deposits and wholesale operating deposits,
which are both considered to be stable sources of
liquidity. Wholesale operating deposits are considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm. The table below
shows the loan and deposit balances, the loans-to-
deposits ratio, and deposits as a percentage of total
liabilities, as of September 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end
deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected. Average deposits
increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 compared to the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2020, reflecting significant inflows across the LOBs primarily driven by the effect of certain
government actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In CCB, the increase was also driven by growth from
existing and new accounts across both consumer and small business customers. Refer to the discussion of the Firm’s
Business Segment Results and the Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 22-46 and pages 16-17, respectively,
for further information on deposit and liability balance trends.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at September 30,
2021, compared with December 31, 2020, reflecting the
impact of client activities and secured financing of
trading assets in CIB Markets, partially offset by
lower secured financing of AFS investment securities
in Treasury and CIO.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
consist of other borrowed funds and issuance of
wholesale commercial paper. The decrease in commercial
paper at September 30, 2021, from December 31, 2020
was due to lower net issuance primarily for short-term
liquidity management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds at
September 30, 2021, from December 31, 2020, and for
the average three and nine months ended September 30,
2021 compared to the prior year period, was primarily
due to net issuances of structured notes and higher
overdrafts in CIB Markets.

  Long-term funding and issuance                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Long-term funding provides an additional source of
stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s
long-term funding plan is driven primarily by expected
client activity, liquidity considerations, and
regulatory requirements, including TLAC. Long-term
funding objectives include maintaining
diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its
optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term
unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to
provide flexibility in support of both bank and non-
bank subsidiary funding needs. The Parent Company
advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its
subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to
external counterparties. The following table
summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities
or redemptions for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 102–108 and Note 20 of JPMorgan

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above.
Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further description of the client-driven loan
securitizations.

  Credit ratings                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to SPEs
on page 19, and liquidity risk and credit-related
contingent features in Note 4 for additional
information on the impact of a credit ratings
downgrade on the funding requirements for VIEs, and on
derivatives and collateral agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2021, were as follows:

(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM;
these are reported within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated balance sheets.

(b) Represents the net notional amount of protection purchased and sold through credit derivatives and credit-
related notes used to manage credit exposures. Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current
presentation. (c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation. (d) At September
30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, nonperforming assets excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $644 million and $874 million, respectively, and real estate owned (“REO”) insured
by U.S. government agencies of $5 million and $9 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon
the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed
on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance. The Firm has provided various forms of assistance to
customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered troubled debt
restructurings ( “ TDRs ” ). Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the recognition
of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers and clients who would have otherwise
moved into past due or nonaccrual status. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 61-65 and Wholesale Credit
Portfolio on pages 66-74 for information on loan modifications as of September 30, 2021. Refer to Notes 12 and 13
of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s accounting policies for loan modifications
and the allowance for credit losses. Paycheck Protection Program At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the
Firm had approximately $13 billion and $27 billion, respectively, of PPP loans remaining, including $11 billion and
$19 billion, respectively, in the consumer portfolio, and $2 billion and $8 billion, respectively, in the wholesale
portfolio. Since inception of the Program, the Firm funded approximately $40 billion of loans. The PPP ended on May
31, 2021 for new applications. The Firm continues to process forgiveness applications, and through September 30,
2021, approximately $27 billion of loans were forgiven by the SBA. This resulted in accelerated recognition in
interest income of the associated deferred processing fees, primarily in CCB. Refer to CCB segment results on pages
24-28 and Credit Portfolio on page 113 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion on the PPP.

  CONSUMER CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                             
The Firm’s retained consumer portfolio consists primarily of residential real estate loans, credit card loans,
scored auto and business banking loans, as well as associated lending-related commitments. The Firm’s focus is on
serving primarily the prime segment of the consumer credit market. The macroeconomic environment continued to
improve in 2021, with the credit performance of the consumer portfolio, including net charge-offs, benefiting from
government stimulus programs, payment deferral programs and increasing home prices. Refer to Note 11 of this Form
10-Q; and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 114-120 and Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further
information on consumer loans, as well as the Firm’s nonaccrual and charge-off accounting policies. Refer to Note
22 of this Form 10-Q and Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on lending-related
commitments.

billion, respectively. These operating lease assets are included in other assets on the Firm’s Consolidated balance
sheets. Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans and overdrafts.

(d) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included $11.1 billion and $19.2 billion of loans, respectively,
in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because
the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on page 60 for a further discussion of the PPP.

(e) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB.

(f) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available
lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines
of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further
information.

(g) Includes billed interest and fees.

(h) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.

(i) Represents the notional amount of protection obtained through the issuance of credit-related notes that
reference certain pools of residential real estate and auto loans in the retained consumer portfolio.

(j) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due
and insured by U.S. government agencies of $644 million and $874 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due,
predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(l) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $35.2 billion and $16.0 billion for the three
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and were $27.9 billion and $18.2 billion for the nine
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-
off/(recovery) rates.

In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to
customers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic,
predominantly in the form of payment deferrals. During
the third quarter of 2021, there were approximately
$390 million of new enrollments in consumer payment
deferral programs.

As of September 30, 2021, the Firm had approximately
$3.7 billion of retained consumer loans under payment
deferral programs, a decrease of approximately $24.6
billion from June 30, 2020. The loans under deferral
were predominantly in residential real estate.
Predominantly all borrowers that exited payment
deferral programs are current. The Firm continues to
monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject
to payment deferrals throughout the deferral period and
on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to
resume making regularly scheduled payments and
considers expected losses of principal and accrued
interest on these loans in its allowance for credit
losses.

Of the $3.7 billion of retained loans still under
payment deferral programs as of September 30, 2021,
approximately $1.6 billion were accounted for as TDRs
prior to payment deferral and approximately $100
million were accounted for as TDRs because they did not
qualify for or the Firm did not elect the option to
suspend TDR accounting guidance provided by the CARES
Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations
Act. Borrowers that are unable to resume or continue
making payments in accordance with the original or
modified contractual terms of their agreements upon
exit from deferral programs will be placed on
nonaccrual status in line with the Firm’s nonaccrual
policy, except for credit cards as permitted by
regulatory guidance, and the loans charged off or down
in accordance with the Firm’s charge-off policies.
Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for
additional information on the Firm’s nonaccrual and
charge-off policies.

Portfolio analysis Loans increased from December 31,
2020 driven by higher residential real estate loans at
fair value, partially offset by lower retained
residential real estate loans. Residential real
estate: The residential real estate portfolio,
including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value,
predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit. Retained loans declined
from December 31, 2020 due to paydowns outpacing
originations of prime mortgage loans in Home Lending,
largely offset by growth in AWM. Retained nonaccrual
loans decreased from December 31, 2020 reflecting
improved credit performance . T he three and nine
month periods ending September 30, 2021 reflected net
recoveries benefiting from further improvement in HPI
and higher reversals of prior write-downs due to loan
prepayments as a result of the low rate environment
compared to net charge-offs for the three months ended
September 30, 2020, and lower net recoveries for the
nine months ended September 30, 2020. In addition, the
nine months ended September 30, 2020 included a
recovery on a loan sale. Loans at fair value increased
from December 31, 2020, reflecting loan purchase
activity in CIB driven by higher client demand, as
well as increased originations in Home Lending due to
the continued low rate environment. Nonaccrual loans
at fair value decreased from December 31, 2020 due to
sales in CIB. The carrying value of home equity lines
of credit outstanding was $19.8 billion at September
30, 2021. This amount included $6.6 billion of HELOCs
that have recast from interest-only to fully
amortizing payments or have been modified and $6.4
billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which
primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk
of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or
reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by
law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile. At
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying
value of interest-only residential mortgage loans were
$27.8 billion and $25.6 billion, respectively. These
loans have an interest-only payment period generally
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully
amortizing payment period to maturity and are
typically originated as higher-balance loans to
higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. Net
recoveries and charge-offs for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, were
not material, as the credit performance of this
portfolio is generally in line with the performance of
the broader prime mortgage portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

(a) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, $9
million and $7 million of loans modified subsequent to
repurchase from Ginnie Mae in accordance with the
standards of the appropriate government agency (i.e.,
Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”), U.S.
Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”), Rural Housing
Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“RHS”))
are not included in the table above. When such loans
perform subsequent to modification in accordance with
Ginnie Mae guidelines, they are generally sold back
into Ginnie Mae loan pools. Modified loans that do not
re-perform become subject to foreclosure. Refer to
Note 13 for additional information about sales of
loans in securitization transactions with Ginnie Mae.
(b) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
nonaccrual loans included $2.9 billion and $3.0
billion of TDRs for which the borrowers were less than
90 days past due. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2020 Form 10-K for additional information about loans
modified in a TDR that are on nonaccrual status.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, predominantly consists
of prime-quality scored auto and business banking
loans, as well as overdrafts. The portfolio was
relatively flat when compared with December 31, 2020
due to growth in the scored auto portfolio
predominantly offset by a decrease in business banking
loans. The increase in the scored auto portfolio was
predominantly driven by loan originations largely
offset by paydowns. Business Banking loans declined
due to PPP loan forgiveness and paydowns largely
offset by loan originations. Net charge offs for the
three months ended September 30, 2021 increased when
compared to the same period in the prior year
primarily due to overdrafts. Net charge offs for the
nine months ended September 30, 2021 decreased when
compared to the same period in the prior year
primarily due to lower auto charge-offs as the current
year had a greater benefit from government stimulus,
payment assistance programs, and higher vehicle
collateral values. The scored auto portfolio net
charge-off rates were 0.03% and 0.04% for the three
months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020,
respectively, and 0.01% and 0.28% for the nine months
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(a) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans
under payment deferral programs offered in response to
the COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their
deferral period and performing according to their
modified terms are generally not considered
delinquent. (b) Includes loans to customers that have
exited COVID-19 related payment deferral programs and
are 90 or more days past due, predominantly all of
which were considered collateral-dependent at time of
exit.
                                                        64

Total credit card loans were relatively flat from
December 31, 2020 reflecting higher payments, offset
by strong sales volume in the second and third
quarters of 2021. The September 30, 2021 30+ and 90+
day delinquency rates of 1.00% and 0.49%,
respectively, decreased compared to the December 31,
2020 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68% and
0.92%, respectively. The delinquency rates continue to
be positively impacted by government stimulus and
support provided to borrowers who participated in
payment assistance programs. Net charge-offs decreased
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021
compared with the prior year periods reflecting lower
charge-offs and higher recoveries as consumer cash
balances remained elevated benefiting from the impact
of government stimulus and payment assistance
programs.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 11 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

At September 30, 2021, the Firm had $1.1 billion of
credit card loans outstanding that have been modified
in TDRs, which does not include loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered TDRs, compared to $1.4 billion at December
31, 2020. Refer to Note 11 for additional information
about loan modification programs to borrowers.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 68-71 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated exposures held in CCB, including
business banking and auto dealer exposure for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the
allowance for credit losses. In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the credit environment continued to
improve following the broad-based deterioration in 2020 that resulted from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. As
of September 30, 2021, retained loans increased $17.8 billion driven by CIB and AWM partially offset by decreases
in CB and CCB. In CB, the decrease was largely driven by a net decrease in PPP loans. Lending-related commitments
increased $49.4 billion, predominantly driven by net portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase in
held for sale commitments intended to be syndicated. In the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the investment-
grade percentage of the credit portfolio decreased from 71% to 70% driven by net portfolio activity, including new
commitments. Criticized exposure was $41.6 billion at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Nonperforming
exposure decreased $814 million driven by lower nonperforming loans, largely in Oil & Gas and Individuals and
Individual Entities, with net portfolio activity and select upgrades being partially offset by select downgrades.
The decrease in nonperforming loans was partially offset by an increase in nonperforming derivatives. Net charge-
offs were $100 million.

Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19
pandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with
the Firm’s overall credit risk management framework.
As of September 30, 2021, predominantly all of these
loans were considered performing.

In March 2020, the Firm began providing assistance to clients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, predominantly
in the form of payment deferrals and covenant modifications.

As of September 30, 2021, the Firm had approximately $177 million of retained loans under payment deferral, which
decreased from $16.8 billion at June 30, 2020. Predominantly all clients that exited deferral are current or have
paid down their loans. The Firm continues to monitor the credit risk associated with loans subject to deferrals
throughout the deferral period and on an ongoing basis after the borrowers are required to resume making regularly
scheduled payments and considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest on these loans in its allowance
for credit losses.

In addition, the Firm granted assistance in the form of covenant modifications. These types of assistance, both
payment deferrals and covenant modifications, are generally not reported as TDRs, either because the modifications
were insignificant or they qualified for the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as
provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. Loans under assistance continue to
be risk-rated in accordance with the Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of September 30, 2021,
substantially all of these loans were considered performing.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as
of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Represents loans held-for-sale, primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio, and loans at fair value.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes. Prior-period
amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(d) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(e) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at September 30,
2021, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

  Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which
consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure excluding loans
held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $41.6 billion at both September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020,
representing approximately 3.8% and 4.0% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively, as select downgrades
were offset by select upgrades and net portfolio activity. The total criticized exposure at September 30, 2021 was
largely undrawn and $38.5 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to
Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

Oil & Gas exposure was $46.2 billion as of September 30, 2021, including $27.2 billion of Exploration & Production
and Oil field Services as shown in the table below. During the nine months ended September 30, 2021, the
investment-grade percentage decreased from 47% to 41%, predominantly driven by increased noninvestment-grade
derivative receivables resulting from market movements related to Oil & Gas prices. However, criticized exposure
decreased by $2.4 billion from $5.7 billion at December 31, 2020 to $3.3 billion at September 30, 2021, driven by
net portfolio activity and select upgrades partially offset by select downgrades.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit,
and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity
securities). Because of this collateralization, no
allowance for credit losses is generally held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm
establishes margin requirements and monitors the
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange,
equities, and commodities. The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet these needs and uses
derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making
activities, including the counterparty credit risk
arising from derivative receivables. The Firm also
uses derivative instruments to manage its own credit
risk and other market risk exposure. The nature of the
counterparty and the settlement mechanism of the
derivative affect the credit risk to which the Firm is
exposed. For OTC derivatives the Firm is exposed to
the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For
exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures
and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-
cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to
the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,
the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures
arising from derivative contracts through the use of
legally enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter
derivative transactions subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity and centrally
cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 88% at both September 30, 2021, and
December 31, 2020. Refer to Note 4 for additional
information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion
of derivative contracts, counterparties and settlement
types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets were $67.9 billion and
$75.4 billion at September 30, 2021, and December 31,
2020, respectively, with decreases primarily driven by
maturities of certain trades in CIB. Derivative
receivables represent the fair value of the derivative
contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable
master netting agreements and the related cash
collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other
cash collateral that the Firm believes is legally
enforceable and may be used as security when the fair
value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s favor.
For these purposes, the definition of liquid
securities is consistent with the definition of high
quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule, but that the
Firm believes is legally enforceable. The collateral
amounts for each counterparty are limited to the net
derivative receivables for the counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it
is available as security against potential exposure
that could arise should the fair value of the client’s
derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer
to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use
of collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises: • the allowance
for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s retained loan
portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and is presented
separately on the Consolidated balance sheets, • the
allowance for lending-related commitments, which is
presented on the Consolidated balance sheets in
accounts payable and other liabilities, and • the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS securities and is
reflected within Investment Securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in
the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of
September 30, 2021 was $20.5 billion, a decrease from
$30.8 billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease in
the allowance for credit losses reflected: • an $8.0
billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the
credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and • a $2.3 billion net
reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, reflecting
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook. The
COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many macroeconomic
variables (“MEVs”) used in the Firm's allowance
estimate which has created challenges in the use of
modeled credit loss estimates, increased the reliance
on management judgment, and resulted in adjustments to
appropriately address the economic circumstances.
These adjustments continued through the third quarter
of 2021, although to a lesser extent than experienced
during 2020. The U.S. economy has continued to improve
despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic,
with the benefits of vaccination resulting in
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,
particularly in the adverse scenarios. However,
uncertainties remain, including the impact that
additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may have on
the pace of economic growth, the strength of
underlying labor markets with the expiration of
government assistance programs, and the potential for
changes in consumer behavior that could have longer
term impacts on certain sectors. As a result of these
uncertainties, the Firm retained meaningful weighting
on its adverse scenarios in the third quarter of 2021,
in line with the second quarter of 2021, but to a
lesser extent than the fourth quarter of 2020. These
adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions outlined below, resulting in a weighted
average U.S. unemployment rate near 7% into the first
quarter of 2022

and falling below 6% in the third quarter of 2022, and
a weighted average cumulative change in U.S. gross
domestic product ("GDP") of 3.8% in the fourth quarter
of 2022. The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected

(a) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed
probable, modified PCD loans, and non-collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected
to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the
wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loan losses modified or reasonably
expected to be modified in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not
consider any incremental penalty rates.

(b) Excludes the allowance for credit losses on investment securities of $73 million and $120 million as of
September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(c) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted
by regulatory guidance.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet or asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held non-traded financial instruments and
are managed in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are
typically intended to be held over extended periods
and, accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for
short-term realized gains with respect to these
investments. Investment securities risk Investment
securities risk includes the exposure associated with
a default in the payment of principal and interest.
This risk is mitigated given that the investment
securities portfolio held by Treasury and CIO is
predominantly invested in high-quality securities. At
September 30, 2021, the Treasury and CIO investment
securities portfolio, net of allowance for credit
losses, was $593.0 billion, and the average credit
rating of the securities comprising the portfolio was
AA+ (based upon external ratings where available and
where not available, based primarily upon internal
risk ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on
pages 44-46 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
78-82 for further information on the market risk
inherent in the portfolio. Refer to Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 54-58 for further information on
related liquidity risk.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately held non-traded financial
instruments representing ownership interests or other
forms of junior capital and span multiple asset
classes. These investments are made by dedicated
investing businesses or as part of a broader business
strategy. In general, principal investments include
tax-oriented investments and investments made to
enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business strategies
and exclude those that are consolidated on the Firm's
balance sheets. The Firm’s investments will continue
to evolve in line with its strategies, including the
Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities
and minority-owned businesses. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios have not been
significantly affected as a result of the COVID-19
pandemic. The table below presents the aggregate
carrying values of the principal investment portfolios
as September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
135–142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Market Risk Management continues to actively monitor
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on market risk
exposures by leveraging existing risk measures and
controls.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 85.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.
                                                                                                                   
  Value-at-risk                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 137 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages
140-142 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

Average total VaR decreased by $7 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2021 when compared
with June 30, 2021. This was due to volatility rolling

Average total VaR decreased by $54 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with
the same period in the prior year. This decrease was
driven by volatility which occurred at the onset of
the COVID-19 pandemic rolling out of the one-year
historical look-back period, predominantly impacting
exposures in fixed income and commodities.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. As noted previously, average
total VaR decreased by $54 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021, compared with the same period in
the prior year. Daily Risk Management VaR has returned to pre-pandemic levels, as the volatility which occurred in
late March of 2020 at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has rolled out of the one-year historical look-back
period.

The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude select components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, certain valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset backtesting gains and losses on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

For the 12 months ended September 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 157 of the 259 days, and observed
eight VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the Firm posted backtesting gains
on 44 of the 66 days, and observed four VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended September 30, 2021. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk
Management VaR for the prior day. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than
one hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market
Risk section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory
VaR applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities but also from the Firm’s traditional
banking activities, which include extension of loans
and credit facilities, taking deposits and issuing
debt as well as from the investment securities
portfolio. Refer to the table on page 136 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a summary by LOB and
Corporate, identifying positions included in earnings-
at-risk. One way the Firm evaluates its structural
interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.
Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate
exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest
rates and in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes
to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets
and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other
currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These
simulations primarily include retained loans,
deposits, deposits with banks, investment securities,
long-term debt and any related interest rate hedges,
and funds transfer pricing of other positions in risk
management VaR and other sensitivity-based measures as
described on page 136 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K. Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the
potential change to a net interest income baseline,
over the following 12 months utilizing multiple
assumptions. These scenarios include a parallel shift
involving changes to both short-term and long-term
rates by an equal amount; a steeper yield curve
involving holding short-term rates constant and
increasing long-term rates; and a flatter yield curve
involving increasing short-term rates and holding
long-term rates constant. These scenarios consider
many different factors, including: • The impact on
exposures as a result of instantaneous changes in
interest rates from baseline rates. • Forecasted
balance sheet, as well as modeled prepayment and
reinvestment behavior, but do not include assumptions
about actions that could be taken by the Firm or its
clients and customers in response to any such
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts do not currently include
assumptions to account for the reversal of
Quantitative Easing in the 12-month horizon for
earnings-at-risk. • The pricing sensitivity of
deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount
by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given
change in market interest rates. The deposit rates
paid in these scenarios may differ from actual deposit
rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors. While a relevant measure
of the Firm’s interest rate exposure, the earnings-at-
risk analysis does not represent a forecast of the
Firm’s net interest income (Refer to Outlook on page 8
for additional information). The Firm’s U.S. dollar
sensitivities are presented in the table below.

The change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as
of September 30, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020
reflected updates to the Firm’s baseline for higher
long-term rates as well as the impact of changes in
the Firm’s balance sheet. The Firm’s sensitivity to
rates is primarily a result of assets repricing at a
faster pace than deposits. Based upon current and
implied market rates as of September 30, 2021,
scenarios reflecting lower rates could result in
negative interest rates. The U.S. has never
experienced an interest rate environment where the
Federal Reserve has a negative interest rate policy.
In a negative interest rate environment, the modeling
assumptions used for certain assets and liabilities
require additional management judgment and therefore,
the actual outcomes may differ from these assumptions.
The Firm’s non-U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented
in the table below.

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and funding activities by assessing the potential
impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to changes in relevant market
variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on page 136 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2021 and December
31, 2020, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply
management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

(a) Excludes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured under the measurement
alternative. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

(b) Effective September 30, 2021, the Firm’s funding spread risk measure for both derivatives and fair value option
elected liabilities now represents the sensitivity to the Firm's FVA spread. Previously, these measures represented
the sensitivity to the Firm’s credit spread observed in the market. The Firm believes the updated measure is more
reflective of the Firm’s funding spread risk. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current
presentation.

(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.

(e) Impact recognized through OCI.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Country Risk Management continues to monitor
the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on individual countries. Refer to pages 143-144 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form
10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table presents
the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2021 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2020. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the
Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period
to period due to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure to Australia was due to increased cash
placements with the central bank of Australia in the first quarter of 2021, predominantly driven by client activity
following policy decisions in the country and growth in client deposits.

  OPERATIONAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                               
Operational risk is the risk of an adverse outcome
resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes
or systems; human factors; or external events
impacting the Firm’s processes or systems; Operational
Risk includes compliance, conduct, legal, and
estimations and model risk. Operational risk is
inherent in the Firm’s activities and can manifest
itself in various ways, including fraudulent acts,
business interruptions, cyber attacks, inappropriate
employee behavior, failure to comply with applicable
laws and regulations or failure of vendors to perform
in accordance with their agreements. Operational Risk
Management attempts to manage operational risk at
appropriate levels in light of the Firm’s financial
position, the characteristics of its businesses, and
the markets and regulatory environments in which it
operates. Refer to Operational Risk Management on
pages 145-147 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Operational Risk Management.
                                                                                                                   
  Subcategories and examples of operational risks                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
Operational risk can manifest itself in various ways.
Operational risk subcategories such as Compliance
risk, Conduct risk, Legal risk, and Estimations and
Model risk as well as other operational risks, can
lead to losses which are captured through the Firm’s
operational risk measurement processes. Refer to
Compliance Risk Management on page 148, Conduct Risk
Management on page 149, Legal Risk Management on page
150 and Estimations and Model Risk Management on page
151 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for more
information. Details on other select examples of
operational risks are provided below.

Business and technology resiliency risk

Business disruptions can occur due to forces beyond
the Firm’s control such as the spread of infectious
diseases or pandemics, severe weather, power or
telecommunications loss, accidents, failure of a third
party to provide expected services, cyberattack,
flooding, transit strikes, terrorism and health
emergencies. The safety of the Firm’s employees and
customers is of the highest priority. The Firmwide
resiliency program is intended to enable the Firm to
recover its critical business functions and supporting
assets (e.g., people, technology, data and facilities)
in the event of a business interruption. The program
includes governance, awareness training, and testing
of recovery strategies, as well as strategic and
tactical initiatives to identify, assess, and manage
business interruption and public safety risks. The
strength and proficiency of the Firmwide resiliency
program has played an integral role in maintaining the
Firm’s business operations during and after various
events.

Cybersecurity Risk

Due to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, the Firm
continues to leverage use of remote access and video
conferencing solutions provided by third parties to
facilitate remote work. As a result, the Firm has
deployed additional precautionary measures to mitigate
cybersecurity risks.

Payment Fraud Risk

The risk of payment fraud has normalized since the
heightened levels experienced during earlier stages of
the COVID-19 pandemic. The Firm continues to employ
various controls for managing payment fraud risk as
well as providing employee and client education and
awareness trainings.
                                                        84                                                         
                                         
  ESTIMATIONS AND MODEL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                         
Estimations and Model risk, a subcategory of
operational risk, is the potential for adverse
consequences from decisions based on incorrect or
misused estimation outputs.

The Firm uses models and other analytical and
judgment- based estimations across various businesses
and functions. The estimation methods are of varying
levels of sophistication and are used for many
purposes, such as the valuation of positions and
measurement of risk, assessing regulatory capital
requirements, conducting stress testing, and making
business decisions.

While models are inherently imprecise, the degree of
imprecision or uncertainty can be heightened by the
market or economic environment. This is particularly
true when the current and forecasted environment is
significantly different from the historical
macroeconomic environments upon which the models were
trained, as the Firm has experienced during the
COVID-19 pandemic. This uncertainty may necessitate a
greater degree of judgment and analytics to inform
adjustments to model outputs than in typical periods.

Firm on pages 86-88 and Note 2 of this Form 10-Q, and

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities, which covers the Firm’s HTM and AFS
securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and
refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 75-76
and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of MEVs that
are relevant for exposures across the Firm, with
modeled credit losses being driven primarily by a
subset of less than twenty variables. The specific
variables that have the greatest effect on the modeled
losses of each portfolio vary by portfolio and
geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, HPI and U.S. real GDP.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
real GDP, U.S. unemployment, U.S. equity prices,
corporate credit spreads, oil prices, commercial real
estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a weak labor market
and weak overall economic conditions that affected
borrowers across the Firm’s consumer and wholesale
lending portfolios.

The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the
ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the
benefits of vaccination resulting in improvements in
the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the
adverse scenarios. However, uncertainties remain,
including the impact that additional waves and
variants of COVID-19 may have on the pace of economic
growth, the strength of underlying labor markets with
the expiration of government assistance programs, and
the potential for changes in consumer behavior that
could have longer term impacts on certain sectors.
Judgment is still required to estimate the speed and
trajectory of the economic recovery.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 75 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes a significantly elevated U.S.
unemployment rate through 2021, averaging
approximately 2.3% higher over the eight-quarter
forecast, with a peak difference of approximately 3.7%
in the first quarter of 2022; lower U.S. real GDP with
a slower recovery, remaining nearly 2.7% lower at the
end of the
                                                        86                                                         
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 5.9% in the first quarter of 2022; and
lower national HPI with a peak difference of nearly
14.4% and forecasted trough, both in the first quarter
of 2023. This analysis is not intended to estimate
expected future changes in the allowance for credit
losses, for a number of reasons, including: • the Firm
continues to place meaningful weighting on its adverse
scenarios in estimating its allowance for credit
losses as of September 30, 2021, and accordingly, the
existing allowance already reflects credit losses
beyond those estimated under the central scenario •
the impacts of changes in many MEVs are both
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this
analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe
changes in macroeconomic variables • the COVID-19
pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's
allowance estimate, which has created challenges in
the use of modeled credit loss estimations •
significant changes in the expected severity and
duration of the economic downturn caused by the
COVID-19 pandemic, effects of government support and
customer assistance, and speed and trajectory of the
subsequent recovery could significantly affect the
Firm’s estimate of expected credit losses irrespective
of the estimated sensitivities described below. To
demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss estimates
to macroeconomic forecasts as of September 30, 2021,
the Firm compared the modeled estimates under its
relative adverse scenario to its central scenario.
Without considering the additional weight the Firm has
placed on its adverse scenarios or any other
offsetting or correlated effects in other qualitative
components of the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
for these lending exposures, the comparison between
these two scenarios reflects the following
differences: • An increase of approximately $350
million for residential real estate loans and lending-
related commitments • An increase of approximately
$2.6 billion for credit card loans • An increase of
approximately $2.1 billion for wholesale loans and
lending-related commitments This analysis relates only
to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not
intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance
for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential
changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the
judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime
loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and
imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates
based on then-current circumstances and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions
are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the
recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its
process to

consider the available information and associated
risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and
that its estimates of expected credit losses were
reasonable and appropriate for the period ended
September 30, 2021. Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries
a portion of its assets and liabilities at fair value.
The majority of such assets and liabilities are
measured at fair value on a recurring basis,
including, derivatives, structured note products and
certain securities financing agreements. Certain
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home
equity and other loans, where the carrying value is
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the valuation hierarchy, judgments
used to estimate fair value are more significant than
those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess all relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

  Credit card rewards liability                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
The credit card rewards liability was $9.4 billion and
$7.7 billion at September 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020, respectively, and is recorded in accounts
payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The increase in the liability was
driven by continued growth in rewards points earned on
accelerated spend and promotional offers outpacing
redemptions throughout 2021, and to a lesser extent
adjustments to redemption rate assumptions. Refer to
page 154 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
description of the significant assumptions and
sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card
rewards liability.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial
transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business
segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different
from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that
this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been reclassified to conform with
the current presentation, including certain deferred investment tax credits. In the first quarter of 2021 the Firm
reclassified certain deferred investment tax credits from accounts payable and other liabilities to other assets to
be a reduction to the carrying value of the associated tax-oriented investments. The reclassification also resulted
in an increase in income tax expense and a corresponding increase in other income, with no effect on net income.
Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation, including the Firm’s effective
income tax rate. The reclassification did not change the Firm’s results of operations on a managed basis.
Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in
which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase
and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest
entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s
accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to
present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral
receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master
netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented on a net basis
when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The
Firm has elected to net such balances when the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2020 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. Income tax expense The Firm’s
effective tax rate was 17.2% and 19.1% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021, respectively, and
19.8% and 17.7% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflects the recognition of an income tax benefit of $
566million related to finalizing the Firm’s 2020 U.S. federal tax return, which reduced the Firm’s effective tax
rate by 4.0% and 1.2% respectively. The tax benefit included state and local impacts of federal tax method changes
and a reduction in the valuation allowance for U.S. foreign tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for further information.

(a) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 68.6billion and $
117.6billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge
accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities
inventories have been included in each period presented.
                                                        99                                                         
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds,
real estate and other funds, were $ 813million and $ 670million, respectively. Included in these balances at
September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, were trading assets of $ 56million and $ 52million, respectively, and
other assets of $ 757million and $ 618million, respectively.

(e) At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, included $ 27.2billion and $ 15.1billion, respectively, of
residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 8.1billion and $ 6.3billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien
mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S.
GSEs and government agencies of $ 13.1billion and $ 8.4billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

(g) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.
(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 299million, nonagency securities of $ 24million and
non-trading loans of $ 838million.
(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 19million, trading loans of $ 41million and non-trading loans of $
420million.
(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 941million and non-trading loans of $ 813million.
(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.
(f) Includes equity securities of $ 1.0billion including $ 379million in Other Assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.
(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.
(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.
(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to
Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of
attributes of the underlying instruments and external
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in
the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in
level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes
in fair value) for financial instruments classified by
the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021
and 2020. When a determination is made to classify a
financial instrument within level 3, the determination
is based on the significance of the unobservable
inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However,
level 3 financial instruments typically include, in
addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are
actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the
table below include changes in fair value due in part
to observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the
observable components of level 3 financial instruments
using securities and derivative positions that are
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk
management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect
the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities
related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis

Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets since December
31, 2020, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and liabilities measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 109 for further information on changes impacting items measured at fair
value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 Level 3 assets were $ 17.1billion at
September 30, 2021, reflecting an increase of $ 1.2billion from June 30, 2021 and an increase of $ 697million from
December 31, 2020. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2021 was largely driven by an $ 802million
increase in MSRs. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was predominantly driven by: • a $
2.1billion increase in MSRs. partially offset by • $ 444million decrease in gross interest rate derivative
receivables due to settlements net of gains and $ 443million decrease in gross equity derivative receivables due to
settlements and transfers net of gains. Refer to Note 14 for information on MSRs. Refer to the sections below for
additional information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the
three months ended September 30, 2021, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2021, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $
882million of total debt and equity instruments, largely trading loans, driven by a decrease in observability. • $
937million of gross equity derivative receivables and $ 704million of gross equity derivative payables as a result
of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 1.0billion of non-
trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, there were no
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2. For the nine months ended September 30, 2021, significant
transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 1.1billion of total debt and equity instruments,
largely trading loans, driven by an increase in observability. • $ 1.7billion of gross equity derivative
receivables and $ 1.6billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase in observability and a
decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 673million of non-trading loans, driven by an increase in
observability. • $ 736million of long-term debt driven, by an increase in observability and a decrease in the
significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. For the three months ended September 30, 2020,
there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the nine months ended September 30, 2020,
significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 2.2billion of gross equity derivative
receivables and $ 2.7billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and an
increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 2.3billion of non-trading loans, driven by a decrease in
observability. • $ 1.1billion of long-term debt, driven by a decrease in observability and an increase in the
significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. For the three months ended September 30, 2020,
significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 965million of gross equity derivative
payables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For
the nine months ended September 30, 2020, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: •
$ 1.7billion of gross equity derivative receivables and $ 1.9billion of gross equity derivative payables as a
result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 1.1billion of
long-term debt driven by an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs for
certain structured notes. All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the
valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.

Gains and losses The following describes significant
components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses)
for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring
basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude
any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities
where the financial instruments are classified as
level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
rollforward tables on pages 102-108 for further
information on these instruments. Three months ended
September 30, 2021 • $ 1.3billion of net gains on
assets, driven by gains in net interest rate
derivative receivables and net equity derivative
receivables due to market movements. • $ 928million of
net gains on liabilities, largely driven by gains in
short-term borrowings due to market movements. Three
months ended September 30, 2020 • $ 744million of net
losses on assets, driven by market movements in net
equity derivative receivables. • $ 763million of net
losses on liabilities, driven by market movements in
long-term debt. Nine months ended September 30, 2021 •
$ 1.0billion of net gains on assets, driven by gains
in net interest rate derivative receivables due to
market movements, partially offset by losses in net
commodity derivative receivables due to market
movements. • $ 988million of net gains on liabilities,
driven by gains in short-term borrowings due to market
movements. Nine months ended September 30, 2020 • $
374million of net gains on assets, driven by gains in
net interest rate derivative receivables due to market
movements largely offset by losses in MSRs reflecting
faster prepayment speeds on lower rates. Refer to Note
14 for additional information on MSRs. • $ 845million
of net gains on liabilities, predominantly driven by
market movements in long-term debt.

Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives
The following table provides the impact of credit and
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue
in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any
associated hedging activities. The FVA presented below

(a) Primarily includes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that were adjusted based on
observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer
(measurement alternative). Of the $ 1.2billion in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as
of September 30, 2021, $ 1.1billion related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative.
These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the
restrictions on the shares.
(b) Of the $ 314million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2021,
$ 208million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying
collateral (e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using
information from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the
Firm’s experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 12% to 45% with a weighted average of
25%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer, with such
changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of September 30, 2021 and 2020 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by
law, without notice. Refer to page 173 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation
of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value as an alternative measurement for selected financial
assets, financial liabilities, unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives that are issued
as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The
profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be
measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are
not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were $( 6) million and $ 1million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively and $( 8)
million and $ 20million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(d) Reported in other income.

(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments recorded in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further
information regarding interest income and interest expense.

(f) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of September 30, 2021, and December 31,
2020, respectively.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the
fair value option was elected was $ 16.9billion and $ 18.1billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page
126 for more information on volumes and types of
credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
(c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform
with the current presentation.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
(c) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
                                                        118                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, gross and net derivative receivables
and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as "Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets" in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-
related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2021, and
December 31, 2020, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination
features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional
collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined threshold rating is breached. A
downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating
provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain
instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payments
requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current
rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR")) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Excludes the amortization expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied to the
hedged item. This expense is recorded in net interest income and substantially offsets the income statement impact
of the excluded components. Also excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged
items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.
                                                        122                                                        
As of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance
sheets related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the
income statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 19.3billion and $ 11.5billion at September 30, 2021
and December 31, 2020, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September
30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 12.6billion and $ 14.5billion,
respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 11.8billion and $ 6.6billion, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Refer to Note 9 for additional
information.
(d) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.
(e) Positive amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will reduce net
interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities represent cumulative fair
value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future periods.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the
same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

at September 30, 2021, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized
in earnings is approximately eight years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in
fair value of these amounts directly in other income.
(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. The amount
reclassified for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was not material. During the nine months ended
September 30, 2020, the Firm reclassified pre-tax losses of $ 8million to other income related to the liquidation
of certain legal entities and the amount was not material for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Refer to
Note 19 for further information.
Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified
risk management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not
designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are
used to manage risks associated with certain specified
assets and liabilities, including certain risks
arising from mortgage commitments, warehouse loans,
MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign
currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives
used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in
mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as
well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in
mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate
credit risk associated with lending exposures in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not
include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative
receivables, which is included in gains and losses on
derivatives related to market-making activities and
other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate
foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses
were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.
(c) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.
(d) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.
(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of
protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts.
The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is
based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection
are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Principal transactions
The following table presents all realized and
unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal
transactions revenue. This table excludes interest
income and interest expense on trading assets and
liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall
performance of the Firm’s client-driven market-making
activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 6 for further
information on interest income and interest expense.
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument
type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making
businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument
types in connection with their market-making and
related risk-management activities; accordingly, the
trading revenue presented in the table below is not
representative of the total revenue of any individual
LOB.

Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury
and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At September 30, 2021, the investment
securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings
where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). During the second quarter of
2021, the Firm transferred $ 104.5billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes.
AOCI included pretax unrealized gains of $ 425million on the securities at the date of transfer. Refer to Note 10
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio.
The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates
indicated.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 1.3billion and $ 150million, at September 30, 2021
and December 31, 2020, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in
interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by
the U.S. government.

2020, all HTM securities were rated investment grade
and were current and accruing, with approximately 98%
rated at least AA+.

losses on investment securities was $ 73million and $
120million as of September 30, 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives. Taxable-equivalent amounts are
used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal prepayments; and accordingly, actual
maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected maturities as certain securities may be
prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately 6years for agency residential MBS, 4years for agency residential collateralized
mortgage obligations and 3years for nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities borrowed and securities lending
agreements for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding
assets pledged and collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and
net amounts of the Firm’s securities financing agreements as of September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020. When the
Firm has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and
where other relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets,
the balances outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the
Firm exchanges securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the
counterparty, but such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm
has obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such
collateral, along with securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under
U.S. GAAP, is presented in the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and
reduces the “Net amounts” presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities
financing balances are presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the
lender in a securities-for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as
collateral, the Firm recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to
return those securities within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, the Firm held $ 484million and $ 598million, respectively, of
financial assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not
qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing
transactions. The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities
are recorded predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

Corporate.

(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated loans held in CCB, including business
banking and auto dealer loans for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory
agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal
investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global
Private Bank clients within AWM). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Reclassifications of loans to held-for-sale are non-cash transactions.
(b) Predominantly includes purchases of residential real estate loans, including the Firm’s voluntary repurchases
of certain delinquent loans from loan pools as permitted by Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”)
guidelines for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. The Firm typically elects to repurchase
these delinquent loans as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with
applicable requirements of Ginnie Mae, FHA, RHS, and/or VA.
(c) Excludes purchases of retained loans of $ 7.3billion and $ 3.1billion for the three months ended September 30,
2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 19.3billion and $ 10.5billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and
2020, respectively, which are predominantly sourced through the correspondent origination channel and underwritten
in accordance with the Firm’s standards.
Gains and losses on sales of loans Net gains/(losses) on sales of loans and lending-related commitments (including
adjustments to record loans and lending-related commitments held-for-sale at the lower of cost or fair value)
recognized in noninterest revenue for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 was $ 31million and $
225million, respectively, of which $ 30million and $ 211million, respectively, related to loans. Net gains/(losses)
on sales of loans and lending-related commitments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2020 was $
113million and $( 75) million, respectively, of which $ 24million and $( 76) million, respectively, related to
loans. In addition, the sale of loans may also result in write downs, recoveries or changes in the allowance
recognized in the provision for credit losses. Loan modifications The Firm has granted various forms of assistance
to customers and clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, including payment deferrals and covenant modifications.
The majority of the Firm’s COVID-19 related loan modifications have not been considered TDRs because: • they
represent short-term or other insignificant modifications, whether under the Firm’s regular loan modification
assessments or as permitted by regulatory guidance, or • the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act. To the extent that certain modifications do not meet any of the above criteria, the Firm
accounts for them as TDRs. As permitted by regulatory guidance, the Firm does not place loans with deferrals
granted due to COVID-19 on nonaccrual status where such loans are not otherwise reportable as nonaccrual. The Firm
considers expected losses of principal and accrued interest associated with all COVID-19 related loan modifications
in its allowance for credit losses. Assistance provided in response to the COVID-19 pandemic could delay the
recognition of delinquencies, nonaccrual status, and net charge-offs for those customers who would have otherwise
moved into past due or nonaccrual status.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies as follows:
current included $ 41million and $ 36million; 30–149 days past due included $ 11million and $ 16million; and 150 or
more days past due included $ 20million and $ 24million at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.
(b) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent.
(c) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, residential real estate loans excluded mortgage loans insured by
U.S. government agencies of $ 31million and $ 40million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These
amounts have been excluded based upon the government guarantee.
(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.
(e) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.
Approximately 36% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) Includes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual TDRs, regardless of their delinquency status. At September 30, 2021,
approximately 7% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral has
subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 41million and $ 39million and $ 127million
and $ 119million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

(d) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Includes
loans to customers that have exited COVID-19 payment related deferral programs and are 90 or more days past due,
predominantly all of which were considered collateral-dependent at time of exit.

(e) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are guaranteed by U.S government agencies.
Typically the principal balance of the loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified reimbursement
rate subject to meeting agreed-upon servicing guidelines. At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, these
balances were no longer accruing interest based on the agreed-upon servicing guidelines. There were noloans that
were not guaranteed by U.S. government agencies that are 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at
September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020.

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(h) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at September 30, 2021.

(k) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, included mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $
72million and $ 76million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded from the geographic regions presented
based upon the government guarantee.

Loan modifications Modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm grants concessions to borrowers
who are experiencing financial difficulty are generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Loans with short-term
or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the
Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the
CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 116million and
$ 199million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 674million and $
537million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Nature and extent
of modifications The Firm’s proprietary modification programs as well as government programs, including U.S. GSE
programs, generally provide various concessions to financially troubled borrowers including, but not limited to,
interest rate reductions, term or payment extensions and delays of principal and/or interest payments that would
otherwise have been required under the terms of the original agreement. The following table provides information
about how residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs under the Firm’s loss mitigation programs described
above during the periods presented. This table excludes Chapter 7 loans where the sole concession granted is the
discharge of debt, loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not considered concessions,
and loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the application of accounting guidance for
TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act.

modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than
one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on
permanent modifications.

(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest rate modifications and payment delays that meet the
definition of a TDR.

(a) Represents loans permanently modified in TDRs that experienced a payment default in the periods presented, and
for which the payment default occurred within one yearof the modification. The dollar amounts presented represent
the balance of such loans at the end of the reporting period in which such loans defaulted. For residential real
estate loans modified in TDRs, payment default is deemed to occur when the loan becomes twocontractual payments
past due. In the event that a modified loan redefaults, it will generally be liquidated through foreclosure or
another similar type of liquidation transaction. Redefaults of loans modified within the last twelve monthsmay not
be representative of ultimate redefault levels.
At September 30, 2021, the weighted-average estimated remaining lives of residential real estate loans permanently
modified in TDRs were four years. The estimated remaining lives of these loans reflect estimated prepayments, both
voluntary and involuntary (i.e., foreclosures and other forced liquidations).

Active and suspended foreclosure

At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Firm had residential real estate loans, excluding those insured by
U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of $ 693million and $ 846million, respectively, that were not
included in REO, but were in the process of active or suspended foreclosure.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm has temporarily suspended certain foreclosure activities. This could
delay recognition of foreclosed properties until the foreclosure moratoriums are lifted.

(c) At September 30, 2021, included $ 9.1billion of loans originated in 2021 and $ 2.0billion of loans originated
in 2020 in Business Banking under the PPP. PPP loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Other than in certain limited
circumstances, the Firm typically does not recognize charge-offs, classify as nonaccrual nor record an allowance
for loan losses on these loans.

(d) At December 31, 2020, included $ 19.2billion of loans in Business Banking under the PPP.

(a) There were noloans that were 90 or more days past due and still accruing interest at September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral has
subsequently improved, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and nine months
ended months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 .

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at September 30, 2021.

Loan modifications Certain auto and other loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various
concessions to borrowers who are experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant
modifications that are not considered concessions are not TDRs. The impact of these modifications, as well as new
TDRs, were not material to the Firm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020. Additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose loans have been modified in TDRs as of September 30, 2021 and December 31,
2020 were not material.

Loan modifications The Firm may offer one of a number
of loan modification programs granting concessions to
credit card borrowers who are experiencing financial
difficulty. The Firm grants concessions for most of
the credit card loans under long-term programs. These
modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically
include reducing the interest rate on the credit card.
Substantially all modifications under the Firm’s long-
term programs are considered to be TDRs. Loans with
short-term or other insignificant modifications that
are not considered concessions are not TDRs. If the
cardholder does not comply with the modified payment
terms, then the credit card loan continues to age and
will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the
Firm’s standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the
Firm does not reinstate the borrower’s line of credit.

Financial effects of modifications and redefaults

The following table provides information about the
financial effects of the concessions granted on credit
card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults for the
periods presented. For all periods disclosed, new
enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients,
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

The following tables provide information on internal risk rating, which is the primary credit quality indicator for
retained wholesale loans.

(a) The U.S. and non-U.S. distribution is determined based predominantly on the domicile of the borrower.

(b) At September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent. The credit quality of wholesale loans is assessed primarily through ongoing
review and monitoring of an obligor’s ability to meet contractual obligations rather than relying on the past due
status, which is generally a lagging indicator of credit quality.

(c) Represents loans that are considered well-collateralized and therefore still accruing interest.

(a) Loans that were modified in response to the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be risk-rated in accordance with the
Firm’s overall credit risk management framework. As of September 30, 2021, substantially all of these loans were
considered performing.
(b) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan
does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there
have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.
(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

Loan modifications

Certain loan modifications are considered to be TDRs as they provide various concessions to borrowers who are
experiencing financial difficulty. Loans with short-term or other insignificant modifications that are not
considered concessions are not TDRs nor are loans for which the Firm has elected to apply the option to suspend the
application of accounting guidance for TDRs as provided by the CARES Act and extended by the Consolidated
Appropriations Act.

The carrying value of TDRs was $ 928million and $ 954million as of September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,
respectively. The carrying value of new TDRs was $ 180million and $ 188million for the three months ended September
30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 832million and $ 352million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and
2020, respectively. New TDRs for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 reflected deferral of principal
and interest payments, extending maturity dates and the receipt of assets in partial satisfaction of the loan
predominantly in Other and Commercial and Industrial loan classes. The impact of these modifications resulting in
new TDRs was not material to the Firm for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.

  Note 12 – Allowance for credit losses                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. Refer to
Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2020 Form 10-K for a
detailed discussion of the allowance for credit losses
and the related accounting policies.

(a) Excludes the allowance for credit losses on investment securities of $ 73million and $ 120million as of
September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
(b) Includes collateral dependent loans, including those considered TDRs and those for which foreclosure is deemed
probable, modified PCD loans and non-collateral dependent loans that have been modified or are reasonably expected
to be modified in a TDR. Also includes risk-rated loans that have been placed on nonaccrual status for the
wholesale portfolio segment. The asset-specific credit card allowance for loans modified, or reasonably expected to
be modified, in a TDR is calculated based on the loans’ original contractual interest rates and does not consider
any incremental penalty rates.
(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) At September 30, 2021 and 2020, lending-related commitments excluded $ 19.9billion and $ 10.8billion,
respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 710.6billion and $ 662.9billion,
respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 41.0billion and $ 24.4billion, respectively, for the
wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments. Prior-period
amount for wholesale lending-related commitments, including the amount not subject to allowance, has been revised
to conform with the current presentation.

Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2021 was $ 20.5billion,
a decrease from $ 30.8billion at December 31, 2020. The decrease in the allowance for credit losses reflected: • an
$ 8.0billion reduction in consumer, predominantly in the credit card portfolio, reflecting improvements in the
Firm's macroeconomic outlook; and • a $ 2.3billion net reduction in wholesale, across the LOBs, reflecting
improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook. The COVID-19 pandemic has stressed many MEVs used in the Firm's
allowance estimate which has created challenges in the use of modeled credit loss estimates, increased the reliance
on management judgment, and resulted in adjustments to appropriately address the economic circumstances. These
adjustments continued through the third quarter of 2021, although to a lesser extent than experienced during 2020.
The U.S. economy has continued to improve despite the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the benefits of
vaccination resulting in improvements in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, particularly in the adverse scenarios.
However, uncertainties remain, including the impact that additional waves and variants of COVID-19 may have on the
pace of economic growth, the strength of underlying labor markets with the expiration of government assistance
programs, and the potential for changes in consumer behavior that could have longer term impacts on certain
sectors. As a result of these uncertainties, the Firm retained meaningful weighting on its adverse scenarios in the
third quarter of 2021, in line with the second quarter of 2021, but to a lesser extent than the fourth quarter of
2020. These adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions
outlined below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate near 7% into the first quarter of 2022 and
falling below 6% in the third quarter of 2022, and a weighted average cumulative change in U.S. GDP of 3.8% in the
fourth quarter of 2022.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows :

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-
sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB

as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.

The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests.

Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at September
30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, which
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.
Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated
under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide
liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide
lending-related commitments to certain clients of the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded
commitments were $ 12.5billion and $ 12.2billion at
September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020,
respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments in other unfunded
commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for
more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond
vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow
institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third
party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer
TOB transactions.

(b) Predominantly includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in
CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line
item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of
these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in
beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 2.7billion and $ 5.2billion at September
30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or
custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does
not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate
the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would
record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds
investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and
operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party
is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated
to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $
24.7billion and $ 23.6billion, of which $ 8.6billion and $ 8.7billion was unfunded at September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020, respectively. The prior-period maximum loss exposure amount has been revised to conform with the
current presentation. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts
of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020
Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more
information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
                                                        158                                                        
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $
6.9billion and $ 6.7billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at September 30, 2021 and
December 31, 2020 was $ 10.6billion and $ 10.5billion, respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized
and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, and commercial mortgages.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to

Ginnie Mae guidelines

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or
guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying
these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated
to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and
Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to
the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due
to material breaches of representations and warranties
as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option
to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for

Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S.
government agencies under certain arrangements. The
Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans
from Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service
them and/or manage the foreclosure process in
accordance with the applicable requirements, and such
loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the
Firm’s repurchase option becomes exercisable, such
loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance
sheets as a loan with a corresponding liability. Refer
to Note 11 for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2021
and December 31, 2020. Substantially all of these
loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies.

Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
year, or more often if events or circumstances, such
as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate
that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.
Unanticipated declines in business performance,
increases in credit losses, increases in capital
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of
equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the
Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which
could result in a material impairment charge to
earnings in a future period related to some portion of
the associated goodwill. As of September 30, 2021, the
Firm reviewed current economic conditions, including
the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on
business performance, estimated market cost of equity,
as well as actual business results and projections of
business performance. The Firm has concluded that
goodwill was not impaired as of September 30, 2021, or
December 31, 2020, nor was goodwill written off due to
impairment during the nine months ended September 30,
2021 or 2020.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.

(a) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage backed securities
(“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the
Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.
(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
September 30, 2021, and December 31, 2020, and
outlines hypothetical sensitivities of those fair
values to immediate adverse changes in those
assumptions, as defined below.

regulatory capital.
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In this table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is
calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.

for a further discussion on leases.

Firm as lessee

At September 30, 2021, JPMorgan Chase and its
subsidiaries were obligated under a number of
noncancellable leases, predominantly operating leases
for premises and equipment used primarily for business
purposes.

Operating lease liabilities and right-of-use ("ROU")
assets are recognized at the lease commencement date
based on the present value of the future minimum lease
payments over the lease term.
The following table provides information related to

Note 21 – Regulatory capital

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI
subsidiaries are also subject to these capital
requirements established by their respective primary
regulators.
The following table presents the minimum and well-
capitalized risk-based ratios to which the Firm and
its IDI subsidiaries were subject as of September 30,
2021 and December 31, 2020.

III Standardized ratios and a fixed 2.5% capital
conservation buffer for Basel III Advanced ratios. The
countercyclical buffer is currently set to 0% by the
federal banking agencies.
(b) Represents requirements for JPMorgan Chase’s IDI
subsidiaries. The CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital
minimum capital ratios include a fixed capital
conservation buffer requirement of 2.5% that is
applicable to the IDI subsidiaries. The IDI
subsidiaries are not subject to the GSIB surcharge.
(c) Represents requirements for bank holding companies
pursuant to regulations issued by the Federal Reserve.
(d) Represents requirements for IDI subsidiaries
pursuant to regulations issued under the FDIC
Improvement Act.

CECL regulatory capital transition delay

As part of their response to the impact of the
COVID-19 pandemic, the federal banking agencies issued
a final rule that provided the option beginning
January 1, 2020 to delay the effects of CECL on
regulatory capital for two years, followed by a three-
year transition period beginning January 1, 2022.

The Firm has elected to apply the CECL capital
transition provisions, and accordingly, for the period
ended September 30, 2021, the capital metrics of the
Firm exclude $ 3.3billion, which is the $ 2.7billion
day 1 impact to retained earnings and 25% of the $
1.9billion increase in the allowance for credit losses
from January 1, 2020 (excluding allowances on PCD
loans).

The impacts of the CECL capital transition provisions
have also been incorporated into Tier 2 capital,
adjusted average assets, and total leverage exposure.
Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for further information on CECL capital transition
provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at September
30, 2021, and December 31, 2020. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored
business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has
not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of
commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper
facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well
as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose
facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, the Firm, in its role as a merchant acquirer, retains a
contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card transactions that result in a charge-back to the
merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, Merchant Services will (through the cardholder’s
issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction to the merchant.
If Merchant Services is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, Merchant Services will bear the loss for
the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. Merchant Services mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, Merchant Services
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk to the Firm related to charge-backs.
                                                        174                                                        
Loan sales- and securitization-related
indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s
mortgage loan sale and securitization activities with
GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties
that the loans sold meet certain requirements, and
that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans
and/or indemnify the loan purchaser if such
representations and warranties are breached by the
Firm. The liability related to repurchase demands
associated with private label securitizations is
separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its
litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form
10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for additional information regarding litigation.
Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a
sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight resale
and repurchase agreements through the Government
Securities Division of the Fixed Income Clearing
Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients that become
sponsored members under the FICC’s rules. The Firm
also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and full
payment and performance of its sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s
rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these
overnight guarantees by obtaining a security interest
in the cash or high-quality securities collateral that
the clients place with the clearing house therefore
the Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The
Firm’s maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included
in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and
commitments line on page 173. Refer to Note 11 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional
information on credit risk mitigation practices on
resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged
under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of
subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain
long-term debt and structured notes of its
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial
Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 173 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.
The following table presents the Firm’s pledged
assets.

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.

Contingencies

As of September 30, 2021, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement
matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with
potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are
at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business
and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory
antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm
believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for
its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.5billion at September 30, 2021. This estimated aggregate
range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in
which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm
does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of
multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous
yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of
many of the claims, and • the attendant uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings,
including where the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about
the behavior or incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be
incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into
account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the
Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual
losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. Amrapali
. India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with
investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential
housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims
against Amrapali including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver
residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and is ongoing. In
August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm
is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making
preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the
offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act
(“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from
J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation. Federal Republic of Nigeria Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. operated
an escrow and depository account for the Federal Government of Nigeria (“FGN”) and two major international oil
companies. The account held approximately $ 1.1billion in connection with a dispute among the clients over rights
to an oil field. Following the settlement of the dispute, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid out the monies in the
account in 2011 and 2013 in accordance with directions received from its clients. In November 2017, the Federal
Republic of Nigeria (“FRN”) commenced a claim in the English High Court for approximately $ 875million in payments
made out of the accounts. The FRN, claiming to be the same entity as the FGN, alleges that the payments were
instructed as part of a complex fraud not involving JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., but that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
was or should have been on notice that the payments may be fraudulent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. applied for
summary judgment and was unsuccessful. The claim is ongoing and a trial has been scheduled to commence in February
2022. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain
government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to
those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal
antitrust law. In January 2017, the Firm was sentenced, with judgment
                                                        176                                                        
entered thereafter and a term of probation which ended in January 2020, with the Firm remaining in good standing
throughout the probation period. The Department of Labor granted the Firm a five-yearexemption of disqualification
that allows the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption
under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) until January 2023. The Firm will need the Department
of Labor to approve a further exemption to cover the remainder of the ten-yeardisqualification period. A South
Africa Competition Commission matter is the remaining FX-related governmental inquiry, and is currently pending
before the South Africa Competition Tribunal. In August 2018, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class action brought by
U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an alleged
conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted in FX
futures and options on futures. Certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court to be excluded
from the class, and certain of them filed a complaint against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers in
November 2018. A number of these actions remain pending. Further, a putative class action has been filed against
the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain consumers who purchased foreign currencies at
allegedly inflated rates. Another putative class action was brought against the Firm and other foreign exchange
dealers on behalf of purported indirect purchasers of FX instruments. In 2020, the Court approved a settlement by
the Firm and 11other defendants of that class action for a total of $ 10million. In addition, some FX-related
individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S.,
including in the U.K., Israel, Brazil and Australia. Inquiries Concerning Preservation Requirements . The Firm has
been responding to requests for information and other material from certain of its regulators concerning its
compliance with records preservation requirements in connection with business communications sent over electronic
messaging channels that have not been approved by the Firm. The Firm is cooperating with these inquiries and is
currently engaged in certain advanced resolution discussions. There is no assurance that the discussions will
result in a resolution. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class
action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit
and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties
initially settled the cases for a cash payment, a temporary reduction of credit card interchange, and modifications
to certain credit card network rules. In 2017, after the approval of that settlement was reversed on appeal, the
case was remanded to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York for further proceedings
consistent with the appellate decision. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking
primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the
class action seeking monetary relief finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement
agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the
approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended
agreement was approved by the District Court. Certain merchants appealed the District Court’s approval order, and
those appeals are pending. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $
700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement
agreement. The class action seeking primarily injunctive relief continues separately, and in September 2021, the
District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In
addition, certain merchants have filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard,
as well as against the Firm and other banks, and some of those actions remain pending. LIBOR and Other Benchmark
Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies
and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s ("BBA") London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and other
banks are subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and
other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal
of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named
as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates,
including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by
the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other actions, and others are in
various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has granted
class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants,
including the Firm. In a consolidated putative class action related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was
administered by ICE Benchmark Administration, the District Court granted the motion by defendants, including the
Firm, to dismiss plaintiffs’ complaint, and the plaintiffs have
                                                        177                                                        
appealed. In addition, in August 2020, a group of individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims,
alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and
conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards. In November 2020 and May 2021,
plaintiffs filed motions for a preliminary injunction each seeking to enjoin defendants from setting U.S. dollar
LIBOR and to prohibit defendants from enforcing any financial instruments that rely on U.S. dollar LIBOR. The court
held a hearing to address these motions in September 2021. The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related
to Swiss franc LIBOR, the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian
Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate remain subject to court approval. Metals and U.S. Treasuries Investigations and
Litigation and Related Inquiries. The Firm previously reported that it and/or certain of its subsidiaries had
entered into resolutions with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”), the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
(“CFTC”) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), which, collectively, resolved those agencies’
respective investigations relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and
U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct from 2008 to 2016. The Firm entered into a Deferred Prosecution
Agreement (“DPA”) with the DOJ in which it agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging JPMorgan Chase &
Co. with twocounts of wire fraud and agreed, along with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC,
to certain terms and obligations as set forth therein. Under the terms of the DPA, the criminal information will be
dismissed after three years, provided that JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC fully comply with all of their obligations. Across the threeresolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC,
JPMorgan Chase & Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC agreed to pay a total monetary
amount of approximately $ 920million. A portion of the total monetary amount includes victim compensation payments.
Several putative class action complaints have been filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York against the Firm and certain former employees, alleging a precious metals futures and options
price manipulation scheme in violation of the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of the complaints also allege unjust
enrichment and deceptive acts or practices under the General Business Law of the State of New York. The Court
consolidated these putative class actions in February 2019, and the consolidated action is stayed through December
2021. In July 2021, the parties informed the Court that they have entered into a settlement to resolve the action.
In Canada, plaintiffs have moved to commence putative class action proceedings based on similar alleged underlying
conduct for precious metals. In addition, several putative class actions were filed in the United States District
Courts for the Northern District of Illinois and Southern District of New York against the Firm, alleging
manipulation of U.S. Treasury futures and options, and bringing claims under the Commodity Exchange Act. Some of
the complaints also allege unjust enrichment. The actions in the Northern District of Illinois have been
transferred to the Southern District of New York. The Court consolidated these putative class actions in October
2020 and plaintiffs filed their consolidated amended complaint in April 2021. In May 2021, the parties informed the
Court that they have entered into a settlement to resolve the action. In October 2020, twoputative class action
complaints were filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York against the Firm and certain individual defendants on behalf of shareholders who acquired
shares during the putative class period alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or
misleading in that they did not disclose certain information relating to the above-referenced investigations. The
Court consolidated these putative class actions in January 2021. Plaintiffs filed their second amended complaint in
May 2021, which additionally alleged that certain orders in precious metals futures contracts placed by precious
metals futures traders during the putative class period were materially false and misleading. Defendants have moved
to dismiss. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P.
Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class
action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts
violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to
prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to
dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants are
opposing. Wendel. Since 2012, the French criminal authorities have been investigating a series of transactions
entered into by senior managers of Wendel Investissement (“Wendel”) during the period from 2004 through 2007 to
restructure their shareholdings in Wendel. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Paris branch provided financing for the
transactions to a number of managers of Wendel in 2007. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. cooperated with the
investigation. The investigating judges issued an ordonnance de renvoi in November 2016, referring JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal correctionnel for alleged complicity in tax fraud. In January 2018, the Paris
Court of Appeal issued a decision cancelling the mise en examen of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The Court of
Cassation, France’s highest court, ruled in September 2018 that a mise en examen is a prerequisite for an
ordonnance de renvoi and in January
                                                        178                                                        
2020 ordered the annulment of the ordonnance de renvoi referring JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the French tribunal
correctionnel . The Court of Appeal found in January 2021 that it had no power to take further action against
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. following the Court of Cassation’s ruling. At the opening of a trial of the managers of
Wendel in January 2021, the tribunal correctionnel directed the criminal authorities to clarify whether a further
investigation should be opened against JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pending which the trial was postponed. In April
2021, the Court of Cassation declined to hear JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s appeal of the January 2021 decision of
the tribunal correctionnel at this stage of the proceedings. In August 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. entered into
a Convention Judicaire d’Intérêt Public with the French criminal authorities, under which it agreed to pay a fine
of € 25million to resolve the potential legal proceedings. The resolution, which did not contain any admissions,
was approved by the Presiding Judge of the tribunal judiciaire , and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid the fine in
September 2021. In addition, a number of the managers have commenced civil proceedings against JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. The claims are separate, involve different allegations and are at various stages of proceedings. * * * In
addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as
defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has
meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it
intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance
with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is
probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm
evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments
in such reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with
counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $ 76million and $ 524million for the three months ended September 30, 2021
and 2020, respectively, and $ 289million and $ 839million for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020.
There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of
the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very
large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual
outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines,
penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and
after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking
into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other
legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated
financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings,
there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it
has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome
of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on,
among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that
period.

The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2021 and 2020, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported
U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and
tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed
basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each segment is referred to as equity. Periodically,
the assumptions and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and as a result, the capital allocated to
the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2020 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of September 30, 2021, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2021 and 2020 and the consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2021 and 2020, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “interim financial
statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware
of any material modifications that should be made to
the accompanying interim financial statements for them
to be in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2020, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in
our report dated February 23, 2021, which included a
paragraph describing a change in the manner of
accounting for credit losses on certain financial
instruments in the 2020 financial statements, we
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information
set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet information as of December 31, 2020, is fairly

These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Credit derivatives : Financial instruments whose value
is derived from the credit risk associated with the
debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity)

seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.
                                                                                                                   
  Current estimated LTV ratio                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.
                                                                                                                   
  Combined LTV ratio                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio considering all available lien
positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to
present revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.
Management also uses this financial measure at the
segment level, because it believes this provides
information to enable investors to understand the
underlying operational performance and trends of the
particular business segment and facilitates a
comparison of the business segment with the
performance of competitors.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions
governed by that agreement to be terminated or
accelerated and settled through a single payment in a
single currency in the event of a default (e.g.,
bankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or
securities transfer or deliver collateral or margin
when due).

Measurement alternative : Measures equity securities
without readily determinable fair values at cost less
impairment (if any), plus or minus observable price
changes from an identical or similar investment of the
same issuer.

capabilities, fraud and risk management, data and
analytics, and other payments services. Through
Merchant Services, merchants of all sizes can accept
payments via credit and debit cards and payments in
multiple currencies.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior
month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added
to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans
are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan
to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting
specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.
                                                        187                                                        
Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

• Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points
earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards
programs generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate
for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and interest has been in default for a
period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both
well-secured and in the process of collection.
Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on
nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central
clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty
is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant
deterioration in credit quality since origination, as
determined by the Firm.

that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in client-
driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven
market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities
(including physical commodities inventories and
financial instruments that reference commodities).
Principal transactions revenue also includes certain
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to
hedge accounting and specified risk-management
activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive

approaches which largely rely on the use of internal
credit models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

both can vary in amount and timing throughout the life
of the note based on non-traditional indexes or non-
traditional uses of traditional interest rates or
indexes.

Suspended foreclosures: Loans referred to foreclosure
where formal foreclosure proceedings have started but
are currently on hold, which could be due to
bankruptcy or loss mitigation. Includes both judicial
and non-judicial states.

Taxable-equivalent basis: In presenting managed
results, the total net revenue for each of the
business segments and the Firm is presented on a tax-
equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from
investments that receive tax
                                                        189

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services
rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance
over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating
represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds.
A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating
and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked
funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a
weighted average of the performance associated with a
fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable)
Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds,
separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based
on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds
with fewer than three years of history are not rated
and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings,
the assigned peer
                                                        192                                                        
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star
rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The
performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three,
and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive
these rankings are sourced from the fund rating
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-
fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable,
the fund rating providers redenominate asset values
into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on
fund performance and associated peer rankings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a
“primary share class” level to represent the quartile
ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and
at the fund level for all other funds. The performance
data may have been different if all share classes had
been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.

│  JPMorgan Chase’s businesses.On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of a        │
│  strain of novel coronavirus disease, COVID-19, to be a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic and              │
│  governmental responses to the pandemic, which included the institution of social distancing and                │
│  shelter-in-place requirements in certain areas of the U.S. and other countries, have resulted in adverse       │
│  impacts on global economic conditions, including:•significant disruption and volatility in the financial       │
│  markets•significant disruption of global supply chains, and•closures of many businesses, leading to loss of    │
│  revenues and increased unemployment.The adverse economic conditions caused by the pandemic have had a          │
│  negative impact on certain of JPMorgan Chase’s businesses and results of operations, including:•reduction in   │
│  demand for certain products and services from JPMorgan Chase’s clients and customers, resulting in lower       │
│  revenue, and•increases in the allowance for credit losses.Certain models used by JPMorgan Chase in connection  │
│  with the determination of the allowance for credit losses have experienced heightened performance risk in the  │
│  economic environment precipitated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and government stimulus. There can   │
│  be no assurance that, even after adjustments have been made to model outputs, JPMorgan Chase will not          │
│  recognize unexpected losses arising from the model uncertainty that has resulted from these                    │
│  developments.Although global economic conditions have been improving despite the continuation of the COVID-19  │
│  pandemic, any ongoing negative economic impacts arising from the pandemic or any prolongation or worsening of  │

variants of the COVID-19 disease or the emergence of
other diseases that have similar outcomes, could have
significant adverse effects on JPMorgan Chase’s
businesses, results of operations and financial
condition, including:

• recognition of charge-offs and increases in the
allowance for credit losses, including any delayed
recognition of charge-offs due to the impact of
government stimulus actions or payment assistance
provided to clients and customers

• material impacts on the value of securities,
derivatives and other financial instruments which
JPMorgan Chase owns or in which it makes markets

• downgrades in JPMorgan Chase’s credit ratings

• constraints on liquidity or capital due to elevated
levels of deposits, increases in risk-weighted assets
(“RWA”) related to supporting client activities,
downgrades in client credit ratings, regulatory
actions or other factors, any or all of which could
require JPMorgan Chase to take or refrain from taking
actions that it otherwise would under its liquidity
and capital management strategies, and

• the possibility that significant portions of
JPMorgan Chase’s workforce are unable to work
effectively, including because of illness,
quarantines, shelter-in-place arrangements, government
actions or other restrictions in connection with the
pandemic.

The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic negatively
affects JPMorgan Chase’s businesses, results of
operations and financial condition, as well as its
regulatory capital and liquidity ratios, will depend
on future developments that are uncertain and cannot
be fully predicted, including:

• the ultimate scope and duration of the pandemic

• the availability, effectiveness and acceptance of
vaccines

• actions taken by governmental authorities and other
third parties in response to the pandemic, and

• the effect that the pandemic or any prolongation or
worsening of the pandemic may have on the pace of

economic growth, the strength of labor markets,
particularly in light of the expiration of government
assistance programs, and the potential for changes in
consumer behavior that could have longer-term impacts
on certain sectors.

In addition, JPMorgan Chase’s participation directly
or indirectly, including on behalf of customers and
clients or by affiliated entities, in U.S. government
programs designed to support individuals, households
and businesses impacted by the economic disruptions
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could be criticized
and subject JPMorgan Chase to:

• increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny

• negative publicity, and

• increased exposure to litigation,

any or all of which could increase JPMorgan Chase’s
operational, legal and compliance costs and damage its
reputation. To the extent that the COVID-19 pandemic
adversely affects JPMorgan Chase’s business, results
of operations and financial condition, it may also
have the effect of heightening many of the other risks
described in Risk Factors in the 2020 Form 10-K.

Repurchases under the common share repurchase program

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 48-53 of
this Form 10-Q and pages 91-101 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2020 Form 10-K for information regarding repurchases
under the Firm’s common share repurchase program.

On December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced
that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume
share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of
2021. Subsequently, the Firm announced that its Board
of Directors authorized a new common share repurchase
program for up to $30 billion. As directed by the
Federal Reserve, total net repurchases and common
stock dividends in the first and second quarters of
2021 were restricted and could not exceed the average
of the Firm’s net income for the four preceding
calendar quarters.

On June 24, 2021, the Federal Reserve announced that
the temporary restrictions on capital distributions
would expire on June 30, 2021 as a result of the Firm
remaining above its minimum risk-based capital
requirements under the 2021 CCAR stress test.
Effective July 1, 2021, the Firm became subject to the
normal capital distribution restrictions provided
under the regulatory capital framework. The Firm
continues to be authorized to repurchase common shares
under its existing common share repurchase program
previously approved by the Board of Directors.
