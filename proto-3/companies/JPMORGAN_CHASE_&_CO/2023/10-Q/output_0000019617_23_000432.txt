For the second quarter of 2023, JPMorgan Chase
reported net income of $14.5 billion, up 67%, earnings
per share of $4.75, ROE of 20% and ROTCE of 25%. The
Firm's results for the second quarter of 2023 included
an estimated bargain purchase gain of $2.7 billion in
Corporate and a net addition to the allowance for
credit losses of $1.2 billion associated with the
First Republic acquisition. The Firm's results also
included investment securities losses of $900 million
in Treasury and CIO.

• Total net revenue was $41.3 billion, up 34%,
reflecting:

– Net interest income of $21.8 billion, up 44%, driven
by higher rates and, to a lesser extent, the impact of
the First Republic acquisition, partially offset by
lower Markets net interest income and lower average
deposit

balances. Net interest income excluding Markets was
$22.4 billion, up 63%.

– Noninterest revenue was $19.5 billion, up 25%,
driven by the impact of the First Republic
acquisition, higher Markets noninterest revenue and
the absence of losses on equity investments in
Payments in the prior year, partially offset by higher
net investment securities losses in Treasury and CIO.
The impact of the First Republic acquisition included
a $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain in
Corporate.

– Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower
Markets NII, largely offset by higher NIR.

• Noninterest expense was $20.8 billion, up 11%,
driven by higher compensation expense due to
additional headcount and the impact of wage inflation,
$599 million expense associated with the First
Republic acquisition, higher technology and marketing
investments and higher legal expense.
                                                         5                                                         
• The provision for credit losses was $2.9 billion,
reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses and $1.4 billion of net
charge-offs. The net addition to the allowance for
credit losses included $1.2 billion to establish the
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-
related commitments. The net addition also reflected:

– $233 million in consumer predominantly in Card
Services, and

– $79 million in wholesale reflecting $389 million in
CB, largely offset by a $243 million reduction in
Corporate.

Net charge-offs increased $754 million, predominantly
driven by CCB, primarily Card Services , as 30+ day
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels.

The prior year included a $428 million net addition to
the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of
$657 million.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $24.3
billion at June 30, 2023. The Firm had an allowance
for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of
1.75%, compared with 1.69% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $7.8 billion
at June 30, 2023, relatively flat from the prior year,
as lower consumer nonaccrual loans due to loan sales
in the prior year were offset by higher wholesale
nonaccrual loans, reflecting client-specific
downgrades. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on
pages 70-79 for additional information.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.2 trillion were up 13%,
driven by higher loans in CCB and CB, largely as a
result of the First Republic acquisition.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down
6%, driven by:

– the continued migration into higher-yielding
investments in AWM; declines in CIB and CB primarily
due to continued deposit attrition, which for CIB
included actions to reduce certain deposits; and a net
decline in CCB primarily from existing accounts due to
increased customer spending,

partially offset by

– the impact of the First Republic acquisition in CCB,
and an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives.

and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.8% and 13.9%,
respectively.

• SLR was 5.8%.

• TBVPS grew 15%, ending the second quarter of 2023 at
$79.90.

• As of June 30, 2023, the Firm had eligible end-of-
period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of
approximately $792 billion and unencumbered marketable
securities with a fair value of approximately $620
billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of
liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management

• Basel III Finalization: In July 2023, the Federal
Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
("OCC") and the FDIC released a proposal to amend the
risk-based capital framework, entitled "Regulatory
capital rule: Amendments applicable to large banking
organizations and to banking organizations with
significant trading activity". Under the proposal,
changes would include replacement of the advanced
approach with an expanded risk-based approach, which
would not permit the use of internal models for the
calculation of risk-weighted assets, other than for
Market risk. In addition, the stress capital buffer
requirement would be applicable to both the expanded
risk-based approach and the standardized approach. The
proposal would significantly revise risk-based capital
requirements for all banks with assets of $100 billion
or more, including the Firm and other U.S. global
systemically important banks ("GSIBs"). The proposed
effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three year
transition period applicable to the expanded risk-
based approach.

• GSIB Surcharge: In July 2023, the Federal Reserve
also released a proposal to amend the calculation of
the GSIB surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these
amendments would require the Firm to assess its GSIB
surcharge on an annual basis, using the average of the
quarterly surcharge calculations throughout the
calendar year, with daily averaging required for
certain measures within the surcharge calculation.
Surcharge increments would be reduced from 50bp to
10bp and there would also be other technical
amendments to the Method 2 calculation. The proposed
amendments would revise risk-based capital
requirements for the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs, and
would become effective on two calendar quarters after
the adoption of the final rule.

These current expectations are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form
10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on
page 95of this Form 10-Q; Part I, Item 1A, Risk
Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K; and Part
II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on page 209of this Form 10-Q
for a further discussion of certain of those risks and
uncertainties and the other factors that could cause
JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ materially
because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no
assurance that actual results in 2023 will be in line
with the outlook information set forth below, and the
Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking
statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023
should be viewed against the backdrop of the global
and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the
geopolitical environment, the competitive environment,
client and customer activity levels, and regulatory
and legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The
Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates.

In May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking recommending a special assessment related
to the systemic risk determination made on March 12,
2023, to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund
("DIF") arising from the protection of uninsured
depositors resulting from recent bank resolutions. In
its current form, the rule would impose a special
assessment at an annual rate of 12.5 basis points on
certain banks’ estimated uninsured deposits reported
as of December 31, 2022. If this rule is finalized as
proposed, the Firm expects to recognize an estimated
assessment expense of approximately $3 billion (pre-
tax) in the quarter in which the rule is finalized,
which is expected to occur in the second half of 2023.

• Management expects both net interest income and net
interest income excluding Markets to be approximately
$87 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be
approximately $84.5 billion, market dependent and
excluding any FDIC special assessment.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card
Services to be approximately 2.6%.

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank
(the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver,
for $67.9 billion , resulting in an estimated bargain
purchase gain of $2.7 billion recorded in other
income. In connection with the First Republic
acquisition, the Firm issued a five-year, $50 billion
secured note to the FDIC (the "Purchase Money Note"),
and entered into shared-loss agreements with the FDIC
with respect to certain loans acquired and lending-
related commitments assumed in the acquisition. Refer
to Note 28 for additional information.

JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as
of and for the period ended June 30, 2023 reflect the
impact of the First Republic acquisition. Where
meaningful to the disclosure, the impact of the First
Republic acquisition is disclosed in various sections
of this Form 10-Q. The Firm continues to convert
certain operations, and to integrate clients, products
and services, associated with the First Republic
acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and
operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to
which segments certain clients, products and services
associated with the First Republic acquisition,
including deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly,
reporting classifications and allocations may change
in future periods, including across the Firm's
segments.

1A, Risk Factors on page 209of this Form 10-Q for a
discussion of material risk factors that could affect
the Firm. These risk factors include potential impacts
to the Firm associated with current market and
economic conditions, including inflationary pressures,
higher interest rates and geopolitical tensions
(including secondary effects of the war in Ukraine),
any or all of which could result in additional market
disruption, government actions (including with respect
to monetary policies), ongoing impacts to global
supply chains, and other geopolitical risks.
                                                                                                                   
  Interbank Offered Rate (“IBOR”) transition                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The publication of the remaining principal tenors of
U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-
month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) ceased on June
30, 2023 (“LIBOR Cessation”). The one-month, three-
month and six-month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will
continue to be published on a "synthetic" basis, which
will allow market participants to use such rates for
certain legacy LIBOR-linked contracts through
September 30, 2024.

In the second quarter of 2023, the Firm successfully
converted predominantly all of its cleared derivatives
contracts linked to U.S. dollar LIBOR to the Secured
Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as part of initiatives
by the principal central counterparties (“CCPs”) to
convert cleared derivatives prior to LIBOR Cessation.
Nearly all of the Firm’s other U.S. dollar LIBOR-
linked products that remained outstanding at LIBOR
Cessation will be remediated through contractual
fallback provisions or through the framework provided
by the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (“LIBOR
Act”). The Firm continues its client outreach
activities with respect to the limited amount of
contracts that continue to reference “synthetic” U.S.
dollar LIBOR in order to complete remediation by
September 30, 2024.

Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:

• lower advisory fees due to a lower level of
announced deals in prior periods amid a challenging
environment,

largely offset by

• higher equity underwriting fees primarily due to
higher convertible securities offerings and, in the
second half of the quarter, follow-on offerings that
benefited from the lower equity market volatility.

Refer to C IB segment results on pages 30-36 and Note
6 for additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting:

• higher Equity Markets revenue in principal
transactions, primarily in Prime Finance,

• higher Fixed Income Markets revenue in principal
transactions, driven by Securitized Products and Fixed
Income Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in
Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets,

– the increase in Markets principal transactions
revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets
NII, primarily due to higher funding costs

• the absence of $337 million of markdowns in the
prior year on held-for-sale positions, primarily
unfunded commitments, in the bridge financing
portfolio in CIB and CB,

• a gain of $36 million in Credit Adjustments & Other
in CIB, compared with a loss of $218 million in the
prior year, and

• higher revenue related to cash deployment
transactions in Treasury and CIO,

partially offset by

• net losses on certain legacy private equity
investments in Corporate, compared with net gains in
the prior year.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has
offsets across other revenue lines, including net
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of
its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.

Refer to CIB, CB and Corporate segment results on
pages 30-36, pages 37-40 and pages 45-46,
respectively, and Note 6 for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees decr eased due to:

• lower cash management fees in CIB and CB associated
with the higher level of credits earned by clients
that reduce such fees,

largely offset by

• higher lending-related fees driven by the impact of
the First Republic acquisition in AWM and CCB.

Refer to CIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages
30-36, pages 37-40 and pages 41-44, respectively, and
Note 6 for additional information.

Asset management fees increase d driven by:

• higher management fees on strong net inflows in AWM,
and

• the impact of the First Republic acquisition in CCB.

Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 25-29
and
                                                        10                                                         
pages 41-44, respectively, and Note 6 for additional
information; and Business Segment Results on page 24
for additional information on the First Republic
acquisition.

Investment securities losses reflected higher net
losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, associated with repositioning
the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and
CIO. R efer to Corporate segment results on pages
45-46 and Note 10 for additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased in Home
Lending, reflecting lower production revenue due to a
decline in volume, and lower net mortgage servicing
revenue. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 25-29
and Notes 6 and 15 for additional information.

Card income decreased driven by:

• lower net interchange income as a result of an
increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments
to the terms of certain reward programs in CCB,

largely offset by

• higher payments-related revenue, reflecting growth
in Commercial Card in CIB and CB.

Refer to CCB, CIB and CB segment results on pages
25-29, pages 30-36 and pages 37-40, respectively,
Critical Accounting Estimates on pages 91-93, and Note
6 for additional information.

Other income incre ased, reflecting:

• the $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain
associated with the First Republic acquisition in
Corporate,

• the absence of losses on equity investments in
Payments in the prior year, and

• the impact of net investment hedges in Treasury and
CIO,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a
decline in volume, and

• the absence of a gain in the prior year on an
equity-method investment received in partial
satisfaction of a loan in CB .

Refer to Business Segment Results on page 24 and Note
28 for additional information on the First Republic
acquisition; and Note 5 for additional information on
net investment hedges.

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates
and, to a lesser extent, the impact from the First
Republic acquisition, partially offset by lower
Markets net interest income and lower average deposit
balances.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3
trillion, down $42 billion, and the yield was 5.01%,
up 279 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these
assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.62%, an increase of 82
bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.83%, up 157
bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets,
interest and rates schedule on page 198for further
information; and Business Segment Results on page 24
and Note 28 for additional i

nformation on the First Republic acquisition.

Net yield excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial
measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of
the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages

  Year-to-date results                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting:

• lower debt underwriting fees as challenging market
conditions resulted in lower issuance activity in
acquisition financing , and

• lower advisory fees due to a lower level of
announced deals in prior periods amid a challenging
environment,

partially offset by

• higher equity underwriting fees primarily due to
higher convertible securities offerings and, in the
second half of the second quarter, follow-on offerings
that benefited from the lower equity market
volatility.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting:

• higher Fixed Income Markets net revenue in principal
transactions, driven by Securitized Products and Fixed
Income Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in
Currencies & Emerging Markets and Rates ,

• higher Equity Markets revenue in principal
transactions, primarily in Prime Finance,

– the increase in Markets principal transactions
revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets
NII, primarily due to higher funding costs

• losses of $117 million in Credit Adjustments & Other
in CIB, driven by losses on certain components of fair
value option elected liabilities, compared with losses
of $742 million in the prior year, and

• higher revenue related to cash deployment
transactions in Treasury and CIO.

Lending- and deposit-related fees decr eased due to:

• lower cash management fees in CB and CIB associated
with the higher level of credits earned by clients
that reduce such fees,

partially offset by

• higher lending-related fees driven by the impact of
the First Republic acquisition in AWM and CCB.

Asset management fees in creased driven by the impact
of the First Republic acquisition in CCB.

A sset management fees in AWM was relatively flat, as
the decline in market levels was predominantly offset
by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers
and the impact of net inflows.

Commissions and other fees was relatively flat. Refer
to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 30-36 and
pages 41-44, respectively, and Note 6 for additional
information.

Investment securities losses reflected higher net
losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, associated with repositioning
the investment securities portfolio in both periods in
Treasury and CIO.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by
                                                        11                                                         
Home Lending, reflecting lower production revenue due
to a decline in volume, and lower net mortgage
servicing revenue due to lower net gains in MSR risk
management.

Card income increased driven by higher payments-
related revenue, reflecting growth in Commercial Card
in CIB and CB.

Net interchange income in CCB was relatively flat as
the benefit in partner payments in the first quarter
of 2023 related to a periodic tax refund on airline
miles redeemed was offset by an increase to the
rewards liability due to adjustments to the terms of
certain reward programs.

Other income in creased, reflecting:

• the $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain
associated with the First Republic acquisition in
Corporate,

• the impact of net investment hedges in Treasury and
CIO, and

• a gain of $339 million recognized in first quarter
of 2023 in AWM on the original minority interest in
CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51%
interest in the entity,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a
decline in volume,

• the absence of proceeds in the prior year from an
insurance settlement,

• the absence of a gain in the prior year on an
equity-method investment received in partial
satisfaction of a loan in CB, and

• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate
investments .

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates
and, to a lesser extent, higher revolving balances in
Card Services and the impact from the First Republic
acquisition, partially offset by lower Markets net
interest income and lower average deposit balances.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3
trillion, down $113 billion, and the yield was 4.85%,
up 281 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these
assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.63%, an increase of 89
bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.82%, up 171
bps.

The provision for credit losses was $2.9 billion,
reflecting a $1.5 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses and $1.4 billion of net
charge-offs.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses
included $1.2 billion to establish the allowance for
the First Republic loans and lending-related
commitments, composed of $763 million in wholesale and
$400 million in consumer .

The net addition also reflected:

• $233 million in consumer predominantly in Card
Services, and

• $79 million in wholesale reflecting $389 million in
CB, largely offset by a $243 million reduction in
Corporate.

Net charge-offs increased $754 million, predominantly
driven by CCB, primarily Card Services, as 30+ day
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels.

The prior year included a $428 million net addition to
the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of
$657 million.

The provision for credit losses was $5.2 billion,
reflecting a $2.6 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses and $2.5 billion of net
charge-offs.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses
included $1.5 billion, consisting of:

• $800 million in wholesale, predominantly driven by
net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions
related to office real estate in CB in the second
quarter of 2023, and the impact of the additional
weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first
quarter of 2023, and

• $649 million in consumer , predominantly driven by
Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect
of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,
including the impact from the weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of
2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse
scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty.

The net addition also included $1.2 billion to
establish the allowance for the First Republic loans
and lending-related commitments, in the second quarter
of 2023.

Net charge-offs increased $1.3 billion, predominantly
driven by CCB, primarily Card Services, as 30+ day
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels.

The prior year included a $1.3 billion net addit ion
to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs
of $1.2 billion.

(a) Includes depreciation expense associated with auto operating lease assets.

(b) Included Firmwide legal expense of $420 million and $73 million for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and
2022, respectively, and $596 million and $192 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively; as well as FDIC-related expense of $338 million and $216 million for the three months ended June 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively, and $655 million and $414 million for the six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. Refer to Note 6 for additional information.

(c) Included expense associated with the First Republic acquisition of $599 million for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2023. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 24 for additional information.

Compensation expense increased driven by:

• additional headcount, primarily in technology and
front office, as well as the impact of wage inflation,
and

• higher revenue-related compensation in AWM,
partially offset by a decline in revenue-related
compensation in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of :

• $599 million expense associated with the First
Republic acquisition, substantially all of which is in
Corporate,

• higher investments in the businesses, including
marketing and technology,

• higher legal expense, largely in Corporate, and

• higher structural expense, including the impact of
the increase in the FDIC assessment that was announced
in October 2022,

partially offset by

• lower volume-related expense, reflecting lower
depreciation expense on lower Auto lease assets.

Refer to Business Segment Results on page 24 for
additional information on the First Republic
acquisition.

The effective tax rate decreased, reflecting:

• the impact of the income tax expense associated with
the First Republic acquisition that was reflected in
the estimated bargain purchase gain, which resulted in
a reduction in the Firm’s effective tax rate of 3.4
percentage points,

partially offset by

• the higher level of pre-tax income and changes in
the mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal
and state and local taxes.

The effective tax rate was relatively flat,
reflecting:

• the higher level of pre-tax income and changes in
the mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal
and state and local taxes, as well as the lower
benefits related to vesting of employee stock based
awards,

predominantly offset by

• the impact of the income tax expense associated with
the First Republic acquisition that was reflected in
the estimated bargain purchase gain, which resulted in
a reduction in the Firm’s effective tax rate.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased primarily as a result of the First Republic
acquisition, which included the impact of the
repayment of deposits provided to First Republic Bank
in March 2023 by the consortium of large U.S. banks
and amounts paid to the FDIC, as well as CIB Markets
activities. Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s
placement of its excess cash with various central
banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements increased due to the impact of a
lower level of netting on a reduced level of resale
balances in Markets.

Securities borrowed decreased driven by Markets,
reflecting lower client-driven activities and lower
demand for securities to cover short positions.

Refer to Note 11 for additional information on
securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities borrowed.

Trading assets increased due to higher levels of debt
and equity instruments in Markets, in response to
demand from client-driven market-making activities,
and when compared with the seasonally lower levels at
year-end. Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional
information.

Investment securities decreased due to:

• lower available-for-sale ("AFS") securities driven
by paydowns, maturities and net sales, partially
offset by $25.8 billion of securities associated with
the First Republic acquisition as well as the transfer
of securities from held-to-maturity in the first
quarter of 2023 (“HTM”), and

• lower HTM securities driven by paydowns, maturities
and the transfer of securities to AFS.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 45-46,

Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 83, and
Notes 2 and 10 for additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting :

• $150 billion of loans associated with the First
Republic acquisition, primarily reflected in CCB, CB
and AWM.

The increase also included:

• growth in new accounts and revolving balances which
continued to normalize to pre-pandemic levels in Card
Services, and

• higher revolver utilization and originations in CB,

partially offset by

• lower securities-based lending in AWM.

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting:

• a net addition to the allowance for loan losses of
$1.8 billion, c onsisting of:

– $1.1 billion in wholesale, predominantly driven by
net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions
related to office real estate in CB in the second
quarter of 2023, and the impact of the additional
weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first
quarter of 2023, and

– $620 million in consumer , predominantly driven by
Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect
of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,
including the impact from the weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of
2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse
scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty, and

• $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the
First Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023.
                                                        16                                                         
The allowance for loan losses also reflected a
reduction of $587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a
result of the adoption of the Financial Instruments -
Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting
guidance. References in this Form 10-Q to "changes to
the TDR accounting guidance" pertain to the Firm's
adoption of this guidance.

There was also a $196 million net reduction in the
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized
in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets, which included a $97 million addition to
establish the allowance for the First Republic
lending-related commitments .

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 62-83, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for additional
information on loans and the total allowance for
credit losses; and Business Segment Results on page 24
and Note 28 for additional information on the First
Republic acquisition.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased
primarily due to lower client receivables related to
client-driven activities in Markets.

Premises and equipment increased as a result of the
First Republic acquisition, largely lease right-of-use
assets, and the construction-in-process associated
with the Firm's headquarters. Refer to Note 17 for
information on leases.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets increased
predominantly due to the other intangibles and
goodwill related to the Firm's acquisition of the
remaining 51% interest in CIFM, and the core deposit
intangibles associated with the First Republic
acquisition. Refer to Note 15 and 28 for additional
information.

Other assets decreased reflecting lower cash
collateral placed with central counterparties
("CCPs").

Deposits increased, reflecting:

• increases in CIB due to deposit inflows related to
client-driven activities and net issuances of
structured notes as a result of client demand,

• $68 billion of deposits in CCB associated with the
First Republic acquisition, partially offset by a net
decline primarily in existing accounts due to
increased customer spending, and

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives,

partially offset by

• the continued migration into higher-yielding
investments in AWM as a result of the rising interest
rate environment , and

• ongoing attrition in CB driven by higher rates and
seasonal outflows, predominantly offset by inflows as
a result of disruptions in the market in the first
quarter of 2023 .

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements in creased due to higher
secured financing of trading assets and the impact of
a lower level of netting on client-driven market-
making activities in Markets.

Short-term borrowings decreased predominantly as a
result of lower financing requirements in Markets,
partially offset by short-term FHLB advances
associated with the First Republic acquisition in
Treasury and CIO.

Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased
primarily due to lower client payables related to

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
increased driven by higher levels of Firm-administered
multi-seller conduit commercial paper held by third
parties, reflecting changes in the Firm’s short-term
liquidity management, and an increase in loans in the
conduits in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on

Long-term debt increased, reflecting the impact of the
First Republic acquisition, which included the
Purchase Money Note issued to the FDIC, and $25

Operating activities • In 2023, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and lower accounts payable, partially
offset by lower other assets, securities borrowed and accrued interest and accounts receivable. • In 2022, cash
provided reflected higher accounts payable and other liabilities, trading liabilities, and net proceeds from loans
held-for-sale, predominantly offset by higher trading assets and accrued interest and accounts receivable.
Investing activities • In 2023, cash provided reflected net proceeds from investment securities, largely offset by
higher net originations of loans, higher securities purchased under resale agreements, and net cash used in the
First Republic acquisition. • In 2022, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale agreements,
net originations of loans, and net purchases of investment securities.

Financing activities • In 2023, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements, largely offset by net activity in deposits, which included the impact of the repayment of the deposits
provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the First
Republic acquisition, as well as net payments on long- and short-term borrowings. • In 2022, cash provided
reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term
borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and
preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 16-19, Capital Risk Management on

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 96-100.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

The following summary tables provide a reconciliation

  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
                            
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four
major reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In
addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 20-21 for a definition of managed
basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least
an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various
business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and
its investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products
and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the
participating business segments may agree to share
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related
product or service, with allocations to the other
segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment
results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and
CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics
of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet
products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect
economic conditions and other factors, which may
impact the allocation of net interest income to the
segments.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these
risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management
on pages 84-89 for additional information.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business
segment is referred to as equity. At least annually,
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of June
30, 2023, the Firm updated its line of business
capital allocations to reflect the impact of the First
Republic acquisition. Refer to Line of business equity
on page 51, and page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62
and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of those methodologies.

Net income was $5.3 billion, up 71%.

Net revenue was $17.2 billion, an increase of 37%.

Net interest income was $13.7 billion, up 57%, driven
by:

• deposit margin expansion on higher rates in Banking
& Wealth Management ("BWM"), and

• higher NII in Card Services driven by increased
revolving balances.

Noninterest revenue was $3.5 billion, down 8%, driven
by:

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a
decline in volume, and

• a decrease in card income driven by lower net
interchange, as a result of an increase to the rewards
liability due to adjustments to certain reward program
terms,

partially offset by

• higher asset management fees in BWM predominantly
driven by the impact of the First Republic
acquisition.

Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card
income, asset management fees, and commissions and
other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages
91-93 for card income.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding
changes in the value of the MSR asset and related
hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.

Noninterest expense was $8.3 billion, up 9%, driven
by:

• higher compensation expense, including wage
inflation and headcount growth, as well as higher
marketing and technology,

partially offset by

• lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease
assets.

The provision for credit losses was $1.9 billion, and
included:

• net charge-offs of $1.3 billion, up $640 million,
predominantly driven by Card Services, as 30+ day
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels,
and

• a $611 million net addition to the allowance for
credit losses, reflecting $408 million to establish
the allowance for the First Republic loans and
lending-related commitments. The net addition also
included $203 million driven by Card Services,
reflecting loan growth, and the net effect of changes
in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the
impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment
rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, largely
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty.

The prior year included a $150 million addition to the
allowance for credit losses in Card Services.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 62-83 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
80-82 for a further discussion of the credit
portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results

Net income was $10.5 billion, up 75%.

Net revenue was $33.7 billion, an increase of 36%.

Net interest income was $26.5 billion, up 56%, driven
by:

• deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially
offset by lower average deposits in BWM, and

• higher NII in Card Services driven by increased
revolving balances,

partially offset by

• the impact of lower PPP loan forgiveness in BWM.

Noninterest revenue was $7.2 billion, down 7%, driven
by:

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a
decline in volume and

• in Home Lending, lower production revenue from a
decline in volume and lower net mortgage servicing
revenue predominantly driven by lower net gains on MSR
risk management,

partially offset by

• higher travel-related commissions in Card Services,

• higher asset management fees in BWM driven by the
impact of the First Republic acquisition.

Card income was relatively flat as the increase in net
interchange in the first quarter of 2023 due to a
reduction in rewards costs and partner payments
related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles
redeemed was offset by an increase to the rewards
liability due to adjustments to certain reward program
terms in the second quarter of 2023.

Noninterest expense was $16.4 billion, up 7%, driven
by:

• higher compensation expense, including wage
inflation and headcount growth, as well as higher
marketing and technology,

partially offset by

• lower auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease
assets.

The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion, and
included:

• net charge-offs of $2.3 billion, up $1.1 billion,
predominantly driven by Card Services, as 30+ day
delinquencies have returned to pre-pandemic levels,
and

• a $553 million net addition, predominantly driven by
Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect
of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,
including the impact from the weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of
2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse
scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty, and

• a $408 million net addition to the allowance for
credit losses to establish the allowance for the First
Republic loans and lending-related commitments, in the
second quarter of 2023.

The prior year included a $275 million addition to the
allowance for credit losses in Card Services and Home
Lending.

(a) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by
U.S. government agencies of $139 million and $257 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being
placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(b) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on consumer assistance.

(c) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, included $163 million and $1.5 billion of loans, respectively, in Business Banking
under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans are
guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the PPP.

(d) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, the principal balance of loans under payment deferral programs offered in response
to the COVID-19 pandemic was $177 million and $513 million in Home Lending, respectively. Loans that are performing
according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages
108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on consumer assistance.

(e) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $195 million and $315
million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee.

(f) As of June 30, 2023, included a $377 million allowance established as part of the First Republic acquisition.

(g) On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance

Net income was $4.1 billion, up 10%.

Net revenue was $12.5 billion, up 4%.

Banking revenue was $4.2 billion, up 29%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $1.5 billion, up 11%.
Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-for-sale
positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the
bridge financing portfolio recorded in the prior year,
Investment Banking revenue was down 7%. Investment
Banking fees were down 6%, driven by lower advisory
fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking
fees, according to Dealogic.

– Advisory fees were $540 million, down 19%, due to a
lower level of announced deals in prior periods amid a
challenging environment.

– D ebt underwriting fees were $699 million, down 6%,
as challenging market conditions resulted in lower
issuance activity in the leveraged loan market
primarily related to acquisition financing.

– Equity underwriting fees were $318 million, up 30%,
primarily due to higher convertible securities
offerings and, in the second half of the quarter,
follow-on offerings that benefited from the lower
equity market volatility.

• Payments revenue was $2.5 billion, up 61%. Excluding
the net impact of equity investments, Payments revenue
was up 32%, driven by deposit margin expansion on
higher rates, partially offset by lower average
deposits.

included $80 million of fair value losses on hedges of
retained loans.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $8.3
billion, down 5%. Markets revenue was $7.0 billion,
down 10%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $4.6 billion, down
3%, reflecting lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging
Markets, Commodities and Rates as the macro businesses
substantially normalized from the prior year's
elevated levels of volatility and client activity,
largely offset by higher revenue in the Securitized
Products Group and Credit Trading.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.5 billion, down 20%,
predominantly driven by lower revenue in Equity
Derivatives, compared to a strong second quarter in
the prior year.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 6%,
driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates,
largely offset by lower fees and lower average
deposits.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a gain of $36
million, compared with a loss of $218 million in the
prior year, largely driven by funding spread widening.

Noninterest expense was $6.9 billion, up 1%, driven by
higher non-compensation expense, as well as wage
inflation and headcount growth, largely offset by
lower revenue-related compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $38 million,
including net charge-offs of $56 million.

The prior year provision was $59 million.

(a) Allowance for loan losses of $145 million and $130 million were held against these nonaccrual loans at June 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively.

(b) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by
U.S. government agencies of $76 million and $196 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based upon
the government guarantee.

(c) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate.

(d) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, a
non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 20-21.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets may occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.
Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the primary source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount
recognized upon executing new transactions.

Net income was $1.2 billion, up 22%.

Net revenue was $4.0 billion, up 49%. Net interest
income was $3.2 billion, up 77%, predominantly driven
by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and higher
average loans, partially offset by lower average
deposits.

Noninterest revenue was $835 million, down 8%, driven
by lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level
of credits earned by clients that reduce such fees,
partially offset by higher card income.

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, up 12%,
predominantly driven by higher compensation expense,
including headcount growth, as well as higher volume-
related expense.

The provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion,
reflecting an addition of $608 million to establish
the allowance for the First Republic loans and
lending-related commitments. The net addition also
reflected $389 million driven by updates to certain
assumptions related to office real estate, as well as
net downgrade activity in Middle Market Banking.

The prior year provision was $209 million.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 62-83 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
80-82 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results

Net income was $2.6 billion, up 39%.

Net revenue was $7.5 billion, up 48%. Net interest
income was $5.9 billion, up 78%, driven by deposit
margin expansion on higher rates and higher average
loans, partially offset by lower average deposits.

Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, down 9%, driven
by lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level
of credits earned by clients that reduce such fees,
partially offset by higher card income.

Noninterest expense was $2.6 billion, up 14%, largely
driven by higher compensation expense, including
headcount growth, as well as higher volume-related
expense.

The provision for credit losses was $1.5 billion,
reflecting an addition of $608 million to establish
the allowance for the First Republic loans and
lending-related commitments, in the second quarter of
2023. The net addition also reflected $768 million
driven by a deterioration in the Firm's weighted-
average economic outlook, including updates to certain
assumptions related to office real estate, as well as
net downgrade activity.

The prior year provision was $366 million.

Net income was $1.2 billion, up 22%.

Net revenue was $4.9 billion, up 15%. Net interest
income was $1.6 billion, up 30%. Noninterest revenue
was $3.4 billion, up 9%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.1 billion, flat
compared to the prior year, driven by:

• lower NII due to higher funding costs,

largely offset by

• higher management fees on strong net inflows.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.8 billion, up
30%, predominantly driven by:

• deposit margin expansion reflecting higher rates on
lower average deposit balances, and

• higher lending-related fees and average loans driven
by the impact of the First Republic acquisition.

Noninterest expense was $3.2 billion, up 8%, driven by
higher compensation, including growth in private
banking advisor teams, higher revenue-related
compensation and

the impact from the acquisitions of Global Shares and
J.P. Morgan Asset Management China.

The provision for credit losses was $145 million,
driven by a $146 million addition to the allowance for
credit losses to establish the allowance for the First
Republic loans and lending-related commitments.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 62-83 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
80-82 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

Net income was $2.6 billion, up 29%.

Net revenue was $9.7 billion, up 13%. Net interest
income was $3.0 billion, up 32%. Noninterest revenue
was $6.7 billion, up 6%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $4.6 billion, up 2%,
driven by:

• a gain of $339 million on the original minority
interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the
remaining 51% interest in the entity,
                                                        41                                                         
largely offset by

• lower NII driven by higher funding costs,

• lower performance fees, and

• lower asset management fees reflecting a decline in
market levels predominantly offset by the removal of
most money market fund fee waivers in the prior year
and the impact of net inflows.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $5.2 billion, up
24%, driven by:

• deposit margin expansion reflecting higher rates on
lower average deposit balances, and

• higher lending-related fees and average loans driven
by the impact of the First Republic acquisition,

partially offset by

• an investment valuation loss in the first quarter of
2023.

Noninterest expense was $6.3 billion, up 8%,
predominantly driven by higher compensation, including
growth in private banking advisor teams, higher
revenue-related compensation and the impact from the
acquisitions of Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset
Management China.

The provision for credit losses was $173 million,
predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to the
allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance
for the First Republic loans and lending-related
commitments, in the second quarter of 2023.

The prior year provision was $198 million.

Net income was $2.6 billion, compared with a net loss
of $174 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was $3.7 billion, compared with $80
million in the prior year, driven by higher net
interest income due to higher rates, partially offset
by lower Firmwide average deposit balances available
for deployment in Treasury and CIO .

Noninterest revenue was $2.0 billion, compared with a
loss of $244 million in the prior year, driven by:

• a $2.7 billion estimated bargain purchase gain
associated with the First Republic acquisition

• higher revenue related to cash deployment
transactions in Treasury and CIO, and

• higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues
associated with foreign exchange rate movements,

partially offset by

• higher net investment securities losses on sales of
U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and government agency
MBS, associated with repositioning the investment
securities portfolio, and

• net losses on certain legacy private equity
investments in Corporate, compared with net gains in
the prior year

Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion was up $946
million driven by expense of $562 million associated
with the First Republic acquisition , higher legal
expense, and a greater benefit in the prior year on
certain expenses associated with foreign exchange rate
movements.

The net impact of movements in foreign exchange rates
associated with the foreign exchange risk that was
transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues

expense were not material to net income. Refer to
Foreign Exchange Risk on page 22 for additional
information.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$243 million, reflecting a reduction in the allowance
for credit losses associated with the deposit placed
with First Republic Bank in the first quarter of 2023.

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the
investment securities portfolio, and Note 13 for
additional information on the allowance for credit
losses.

The current period tax expense benefited from the
income tax expense associated with the First Republic
acquisition reflected in the estimated bargain
purchase gain, partially offset by changes in the
level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S.
federal and state and local taxes that also impact the
Firm’s tax reserves.

• higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues
associated with foreign exchange rate movements,

partially offset by

• higher net investment securities losses related to
the sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, associated with repositioning
the investment securities portfolio,

• the absence of proceeds in the prior year from an
insurance settlement, and

• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate
investments.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk
governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance framework The
Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and
impacts of risks. Refer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient
level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s
business activities and associated risks during normal
economic environments and under stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K, Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar
3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s capital risk.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and
its insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held
by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-
weighted assets ("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted
according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-
based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm
is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s
Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently
more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based
ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
to calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 51 for
additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL
capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out
at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of June
30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the
remaining $1.4 billion benefit associated with the
CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm
phased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition
provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as
applicable.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and
Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and
the CECL accounting guidance.

Risk-based Capital Targets

The Firm’s target for its Basel III Standardized CET1
capital ratio for the first quarter of 2024 remains at
13.5%. The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary
from the target dependent on market conditions. The
target is based on the Basel III capital rules
currently in effect.

Basel III Finalization

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the OCC and the
FDIC released a proposal to amend the risk-based
capital framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule:
Amendments applicable to large banking organizations
and to banking organizations with significant trading
activity". Under the proposal, changes would include
replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded
risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of
internal models for the calculation of risk-weighted
assets, other than for Market risk. In addition, the
stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable
to both the expanded risk-based approach and the
standardized approach. The proposal would
significantly revise risk-based capital requirements
for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more,
including the Firm and other U.S. GSIBs. The proposed
effective date is July 1, 2025 with a three year
transition period applicable to the expanded risk-
based approach.

GSIB Surcharge

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a
proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB
surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments
would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on
an annual basis, using the average of the quarterly
surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year,
with daily averaging required for certain measures
within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments
would be reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there would
also be other technical amendments to the Method 2
calculation. The proposed amendments would revise
risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and other
U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective on two calendar
quarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer
to Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages
89-90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on the GSIB surcharge.

The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and
Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics. Refer to Note 23 for JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics. First Republic Bank was not subject to Advanced approach
regulatory capital requirements. As a result, for certain exposures associated with the First Republic acquisition,
Advanced RWA and any impact on Advanced Total capital is calculated under the Standardized approach as permitted by
the transition provisions in the U.S. capital rules. Refer to Note 28 for additional information on the First
Republic acquisition.

Analysis and Review On April 5, 2023, the Firm
submitted its 2023 Capital Plan to the Federal
Reserve. On June 30, 2023, the Firm announced that it
had completed the Federal Reserve's 2023 Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review (“CCAR”) stress test
process. On July 27, 2023, the Federal Reserve
announced the Firm's 2023 SCB requirement of 2.9%
(down from the current 4.0%), which will result in a
Standardized CET1

capital ratio requirement, including regulatory
buffers, of 11.4% (down from the current 12.5%) for
the fourth quarter of 2023. The SCB requirement will
become effective on October 1, 2023 and will remain in
effect until September 30, 2024. Refer to Capital
planning and stress testing on pages 86-87 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on
CCAR. Other capital requirements Total Loss-Absorbing

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its contractual and contingent
financial obligations as they arise or that it does
not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor
of funding and liquidity to support its assets and
liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website,
for a further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk.
LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of
eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their
respective estimated total net cash outflows over a
prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant
stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in
excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR
requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank
affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months
ended June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022

framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.
(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading
assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess eligible
HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. (e) End-of-period HQLA balances
were $791.5 billion, $758.9 billion, and $721.1 billion for June 30, 2023, March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022,
respectively. The Firm’s average LCR decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the three
months period ended March 31, 2023, due to long-term debt maturities, common stock repurchases and common stock

dividends paid, predominantly offset by a dividend payment from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company.
The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the prior year period,
driven by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company, partially offset by common stock
repurchases and common stock dividends paid. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three
months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the three months ended March 31, 2023, reflecting an approximate 50%
decline associated with the First Republic acquisition, reducing HQLA and increasing net cash outflows. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA was further impacted by a reduction in cash primarily driven by higher average loans, a
dividend payment to the Parent Company, and a decline in average deposits. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR
for the three months ended June 30, 2023 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting
a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from a decline in average
deposits and loan growth, as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities and the impact of
the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Note 10 and Note 28 for additional information on the Firm's investment
securities portfolio and the First Republic acquisition. Actions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor
behavior, resulting in reductions to system-wide deposits, including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective
eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the continued
impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal
stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended to ensure that the Firm and its
material legal entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios
analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios are produced on a
regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of
stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position.
The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating
subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and

funding sources may be disrupted.
                                                                                                                   
   Other liquidity sources                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had
unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and
debt securities, that the Firm believes would be
available to raise liquidity. This includes excess
eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The
fair value of these securities was approximately $620
billion and $694 billion as of June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively, although the amount
of liquidity that could be raised at any particular
time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The decrease compared to December 31,
2022, was driven by a reduction in excess eligible
HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., largely
offset by an increase in CIB trading assets and AFS
securities associated with the First Republic
acquisition.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of
approximately $332 billion and $323 billion as of June
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. This
borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash and
securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or
other unencumbered securities that are currently
pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window
and other central banks. Although available, the Firm
does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal
Reserve Banks discount window and the other central
banks as a primary source of liquidity.

The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

As of June 30, 2023, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR
requirement, based on the Firm's current
interpretation of the final rule. By the end of August
2023, the Firm will be required to publicly disclose
its quarterly average NSFR on a semiannual basis.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access
funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-
term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The

Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from
long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured
borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other
short-term liquid investments based on their interest
rate and liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 24 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion
of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and
wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods
of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits were lower for the three months ended
June 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended June
30, 2022. The decrease was driven by:

• the continued migration into higher-yielding
investments in AWM as a result of the rising interest
rate environment,

• continued deposit attrition in CIB, including
actions to reduce certain deposits, partially offset
by net issuances of structured notes as a result of
client demand,

• continued deposit attrition in CB, partially offset
by continued inflows as a result of disruptions in the
market in the first quarter of 2023, and

• a net decline in CCB primarily from existing
accounts due to increased customer spending, largely
offset by the impact of the First Republic
acquisition,

partially offset by

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives.

Average deposits were lower for the six months ended
June 30, 2023 compared to the six months ended June
30, 2022. The decrease was driven by:

• the continued migration into higher-yielding
investments in AWM as a result of the rising interest
rate environment,

• continued deposit attrition in CIB, including
actions to reduce certain deposits, partially offset
by net issuances of structured notes as a result of
client demand,

• continued deposit attrition in CB, partially offset
by continued inflows as a result of disruptions in the
market in the first quarter of 2023, and

• a net decline in CCB primarily from existing
accounts due to increased customer spending, partially
offset by the impact of the First Republic
acquisition,

partially offset by

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives.

Period-end deposits increased, reflecting: • increases
in CIB due to deposit inflows related to client-driven
activities and net issuances of structured notes as a
result of client demand, • $68 billion of deposits in
CCB associated with the First Republic acquisition,
partially offset by a net decline primarily in
existing accounts due to increased customer spending,
and • an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives, partially offset
by • the continued migration into higher-yielding
investments in AWM as a result of the rising interest
rate environment, and • ongoing attrition in CB driven
by higher rates and seasonal outflows, predominantly
offset by inflows as a result of disruptions in the
market in the first quarter of 2023. Refer to the
Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the
Business Segment Results on pages 16-19 and pages
22-46, respectively, for further information on
deposit and liability balance trends. Refer to Note 3
for further information on structured notes.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection
that provides additional funding stability and results
in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection
may be available to depositors in the countries in
which the deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC
provides deposit insurance protection for deposits
placed in a U.S. depository institution. At June 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022 (a) , the Firmwide
estimated uninsured deposits were $1,381.1 billion and
$1,353.1 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting
wholesale operating deposits. Total uninsured deposits
include time deposits. The table below presents an
estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits,
and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates
of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data
that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable
FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation,
all non-U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2023,
compared with December 31, 2022, due to higher secured
financing of trading assets and the impact of a lower
level of netting on client-driven market-making
activities in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds.

The decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2023 from
December 31, 2022, and for the average three and six
months ended June 30, 2023 compared to the prior year
periods, was due to lower net issuance levels
resulting from short-term liquidity management.

The decrease in average unsecured other borrowed funds
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023
compared to the prior year periods was due to a lower
level of overdrafts as well as net maturities of
structured notes classified as other borrowed funds in
CIB.
                                                        59                                                         
                                                                                                                   
  Long-term funding and issuance                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations, and regulatory
requirements, including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market
access and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating
its optimal long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external
counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 18 of this Form 10-Q and Liquidity Risk Management
on pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above.
Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan
securitizations.

  Credit ratings                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk

and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Note
5 and Note 14 for additional information.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
June 30, 2023, were as follows:

Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with
the default or change in credit profile of a client,
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a
reduction in expected returns on investments,
including consumer credit risk,

wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit
Portfolio and

Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 65-82 for a
further discussion of Credit Risk.

Refer to page 83for a further discussion of Investment
Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk

  CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                    
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or
customer. In the following tables, total loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-
sale; and certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not include loans which the Firm
accounts for at fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further information
regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12, 24 and 5 for additional information on the Firm’s loans, lending-related
commitments and derivative receivables. Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and refer to Note 11 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in
the securities financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 65-69 and Note 12 for further
discussions of the consumer credit environment and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages
70-79 and Note 12 for further discussions of the wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans. On January 1,
2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure
requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves
a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay,
term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as
financial difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a
modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs will differ
from those previously considered TDRs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.

of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by

exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(l) At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded $39 million and $101 million, respectively,

Portfolio analysis Loans increased compared to
December 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate
loans associated with the First Republic acquisition
and higher auto loans. Residential real estate: The
residential real estate portfolio, including loans
held-for-sale and loans at fair value, predominantly
consists of prime mortgage loans and home equity lines
of credit. Retained loans increased compared to
December 31, 2022, reflecting residential real estate
loans associated with the First Republic acquisition.
Retained nonaccrual loans decreased compared to
December 31, 2022. Net recoveries were lower for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023 compared to
the same periods in the prior year driven by lower
prepayments due to higher interest rates. Loans at
fair value decreased from December 31, 2022, driven by
a decrease in CIB due to sales outpacing purchases
largely offset by an increase in Home Lending as
originations outpaced warehouse loan sales. Nonaccrual
loans at fair value were relatively flat compared to
December 31, 2022. At June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, the carrying value of interest-only residential
mortgage loans was $90.0 billion and $36.3 billion,
respectively. The increase was driven by the impact of
the First Republic acquisition. These loans have an
interest-only payment period generally followed by an
adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment
period to maturity and are typically originated as
higher-balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The
credit performance of this portfolio is comparable
with the performance of the broader prime mortgage
portfolio and there were no charge-offs associated
with the First Republic acquisition. The carrying
value of home equity lines of credit outstanding was
$16.9 billion at June 30, 2023, which included $2.6
billion associated with the First Republic
acquisition. The carrying value of home equity lines
of credit outstanding included $4.6 billion of HELOCs
that have recast from interest-only to fully
amortizing payments or have been modified and $4.7
billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which
primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk
of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or
reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by
law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-
value ratio of residential real estate loans At June
30, 2023, $229.8 billion, or 70% of the total retained
residential real estate loan portfolio, was
concentrated in California, New York, Florida, Texas
and Massachusetts, compared with $147.8 billion, or
62% at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 12 for
information on the geographic composition and current
estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate
loans. Modified residential real estate loans For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023, residential
real estate FDMs were $35 million and $75 million,
respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had
$33 million and $48 million of loans subject to trial
modification where the terms of the loans have not
been permanently modified, as well as $3 million and
$5 million of loans subject to discharge under Chapter
7 bankruptcy proceedings ("Chapter 7 loans") for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
respectively. The changes to the TDR accounting
guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and
concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial
modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered
TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for
further information. For the three and six months
ended June 30, 2022, residential real estate TDRs were
$115 million and $233 million, respectively. Refer to
Note 12 for further information on TDRs in prior
periods.
                                                        67                                                         
Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value consists of prime-
quality scored auto and business banking loans, other
consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The
portfolio increased when compared to December 31, 2022
due to originations of scored Auto loans and an
increase in other consumer unsecured fair value option
loans associated with the First Republic acquisition,
largely offset by paydowns. Net charge-offs increased
for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023
compared to the same periods in the prior year due to
higher scored Auto charge-offs as delinquency levels
normalized and vehicle valuations declined. The scored
Auto net charge-off rates were 0.41% and 0.12% for the
three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively, and 0.43% and 0.15% for the six months
ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

Total credit card loans increased from December 31,
2022 reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving
balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic
levels. The June 30, 2023 30+ and 90+ day delinquency
rates of 1.70% and 0.84%, respectively, increased
compared to the December 31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day
delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68% respectively, and
net charge-offs increased for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2023 compared to the same periods in
the prior year as 30+ day delinquencies have
normalized.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 12 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
credit card FDMs were $181 million and $326 million,
respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had
$26 million of loans subject to trial modification
where the terms of the loans have not been permanently
modified for both the three and six months ended June
30, 2023. The changes to the TDR accounting guidance
eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession
assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications
were considered TDRs, but not FDMs.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022,
credit card TDRs were $81 million and $163 million,
respectively.

Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 72-75 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in
CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm
continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with the First
Republic acquisition to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classifications and
internal risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business
Developments on page 9 for additional information. As of June 30, 2023, the increase in nonperforming exposure was
driven by loans, resulting from client-specific downgrades in CB and AWM, partially offset by a reduction in
lending-related commitments. For the six months ended June 30, 2023, wholesale charge-offs remained low, despite an
increase in charge-offs in the second quarter of 2023 concentrated in Office real estate. As of June 30, 2023,
retained loans increased $64.5 billion predominantly driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition.
Lending-related commitments increased $69.1 billion driven by the impact of the First Republic acquisition, and net
portfolio activity in CIB and CB, including an increase in held-for-sale positions in the bridge financing
portfolio.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk rating profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of
June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position as of June 30,
2023, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which
consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans
held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $35.0 billion and $31.3 billion as of June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, representing approximately 2.8% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively . Criticized
exposure increased, driven by client-specific downgrades largely in Real Estate, Consumer and Retail, Technology,
Media & Telecommunications, and Healthcare, as well as exposures associated with the First Republic acquisition,
partially offset by client-specific upgrades. Of the $35.0 billion of criticized exposure at June 30, 2023,
approximately half was undrawn and $31.8 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The industry
of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on industry concentrations.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 24 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit,
and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity
securities). Because of this collateralization, no
allowance for credit losses is generally held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm
establishes margin requirements and monitors the
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to
which the Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter
("OTC") derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit
risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-
traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and
options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”)
derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the
credit risk of the relevant central counterparty
clearing house (“CCP”). Where possible, the Firm seeks
to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from
derivative contracts through the use of legally
enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral
agreements.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter
derivative transactions subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally
cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 88% and 87% at June 30, 2023, and
December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements and for a further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets was $64.2 billion and
$70.9 billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022,
respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by
market movements in CIB Markets. Derivative
receivables represent the fair value of the derivative
contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable
master netting agreements and the related cash
collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other
cash collateral that may be used as security when the
fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s
favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid
securities is consistent with the definition of high
quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits
of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount
of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it
is available as security against potential exposure
that could arise should the fair value of the client’s
derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally consists of : •
the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), •
the allowance for lending-related commitments, which
is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities
on the Consolidated balance sheets, and • the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in
the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of
June 30, 2023 was $24.3 billion, reflecting a net
addition of $2.7 billion from December 31, 2022. The
net addition to the allowance for credit losses
included $1.5 billion, consisting of: • $819 million
in wholesale , predominantly driven by net downgrade
activity, updates to certain assumptions related to
office real estate in CB in the second quarter of
2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed
on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023,
and • $649 million in consumer , predominantly driven
by Card Services, reflecting loan growth, the net
effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook,
including the impact from the weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of
2024, and the additional weight placed on the adverse
scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty. The net
addition also included $1.2 billion to establish the
allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-
related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The
Firm has maintained the additional weight placed on
the relative adverse scenario in the first quarter of
2023, reflecting an increased probability of a
moderate recession due to tightening financial
conditions. The allowance for credit losses also
reflected a reduction of $587 million as a result of
the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance
on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note 1 for further
information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is
estimated using a weighted average of five internally
developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse
scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic
factors than the central case assumptions provided in
the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter
of 2024, and a 1.5% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the
fourth quarter of 2024.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

periods. Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of JPMorgan

(a) Represents the impact to the allowance for loan losses upon the Firm's adoption of changes to the TDR
accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and
disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow
("DCF") methodology. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF,
portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-
dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to
apply. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably
expected TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") loans.

(c) At June 30, 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had an
allowance for credit losses of $18 million associated with certain accounts receivable in CIB.

(d) As of June 30, 2023 included$1.2 billion allowance for credit losses associated with the First Republic
acquisition.

(e) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted
by regulatory guidance.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At June 30, 2023,
the Treasury and CIO investment securities portfolio,
net of the allowance for credit losses, was $610.2
billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
45-46 and Note 10 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
54-61 for further information on related liquidity
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 84-89
for further information on the market risk inherent in
the portfolio.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve in line with its strategies, including the
Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities
and minority-owned businesses. The table below
presents the aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios as of June 30, 2023

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
131-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.
                                                                                                                   
  Value-at-risk                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages
136-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Divers ification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual
components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and
risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR
for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.

(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio,
which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which
is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the
credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the
widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to
maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.

(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans, MSR, and
related hedges.

(e) For the period ended June 30, 2022, maximum Credit Portfolio VaR remained elevated due to the effects of nickel
price increases and the associated volatility in the nickel market which occurred during the first quarter of 2022.

Average total VaR was flat for the three months ended
June 30, 2023, when compared with March 31, 2023,
reflecting increases in fixed income offset by market
volatility relating to commodities rolling out of the
one-year historical look-back period.

Average total VaR decreased by $7 million for the
three months ended June 30, 2023, compared with the
same period in the prior year predominantly driven by
risk reductions impacting Credit Portfolio VaR as well
as fixed income.

The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five
times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended June 30, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 134 of the 259 days, and observed 15
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 34 of
the 65 days, and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended June 30, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities but also from the Firm’s traditional
banking activities, which include extension of loans
and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt
and the investment securities portfolio. One way that
the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk
estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a
given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a
sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest
income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The
baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of
deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts
simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in
U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar”
currencies). These simulations primarily include
retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks,
investment securities, long-term debt and any related
interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of
other positions in risk management VaR and other
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 132 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-risk
scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both
short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and
holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term
rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These
scenarios consider many different factors, including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates. •
Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in
the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects
certain assumptions relating to the reversal of
Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and
require management judgment. Therefore, the actual
amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular
time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve
may take as part of monetary policy, including through
the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In
addition, there are other factors that impact the
amount of deposits held at the Firm such

as the level of loans across the industry and
competition for deposits. • The pricing sensitivity of
deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount
by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given
change in market interest rates. As part of the Firm's
continuous evaluation and periodic enhancements to its
earnings-at-risk calculations, the Firm updated its
model in the second quarter of 2023 to incorporate
deposit repricing lags impacting both consumer and
wholesale deposits. The model change incorporated
observed pricing and customer behavior in both rising
and falling interest rate environments. Actual deposit
rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions,
primarily due to customer behavior and competition for
deposits. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are
periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to
changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance
sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in
the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a
relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure,
the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a
forecast of the Firm’s net interest income. Refer to
Outlook on page 8 for additional information. The
Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the
table below.

(a) Reflects the impact of the aforementioned model
update to incorporate deposit repricing lags. Prior
periods have not been revised. In the absence of the
model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags in
the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S. dollar
sensitivities as of June 30, 2023, would have been
lower by $4.2 billion to the +100 basis points shift
in short-term and parallel rate scenarios and higher
by $4.4 billion to the -100 basis points shift in
short-term and parallel rate scenarios. In addition,
the change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities as
of June 30, 2023 compared to December 31, 2022
reflected the impact of changes in the Firm’s balance
sheet including the impact of the First Republic
acquisition. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm’s
sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points parallel shift
in rates is primarily the result of a greater impact
from assets repricing compared to the impact of
liabilities repricing.
                                                        87                                                         
The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and
to integrate products associated with the First
Republic acquisition to align with the Firm’s business
and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to
which segments certain products associated with the
First Republic acquisition, including deposits, should
be allocated. Accordingly, earnings-at-risk results
may be impacted in future periods. The Firm’s non-U.S.
dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate
scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with
long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis
points and short-term rates staying at current levels
were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 . In addition to
earnings-at-risk, the Firm also measures Economic
Value Sensitivity (EVS). EVS stress tests the longer-
term economic value of equity by measuring the
sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet,
primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and
investment securities as well as related hedges, under
various interest rate scenarios. In accordance with
the CTC structural interest rate risk policy, the Firm
has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE.

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s
expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

(a) Excludes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured under the measurement
alternative. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of
CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit
spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency.
This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.

(e) Impact recognized through OCI.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 139-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table
presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2023 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2022. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the
Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period
to period due to client activity and market flows. The increases in exposures to Germany and the United Kingdom
were primarily driven by increases in cash placed with the central banks of those countries, due to client-driven
activities, including as a result of changes in interest rates. The decrease in exposure to Australia was driven by
a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting from
changes in interest rates. The Firm continues to monitor potential impacts to the Firm associated with the war in
Ukraine. As of June 30, 2023, exposure to Russia was approximately $430 million. This amount excludes certain
deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally consists of:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated).

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, which
is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities
on the Consolidated balance sheets, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities, which is reflected in investment
securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and
refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 80-82
and Note 13 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses
being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty

variables. The specific variables that have the
greatest effect on the modeled losses of each
portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional
U.S. unemployment and HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.
interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices,
commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the
Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the
loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed
as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk
rating methodologies for the First Republic Portfolio,
and the ongoing integration of products and systems,
the allowance for credit losses for the acquired
wholesale portfolio was measured based on other
facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk
characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As
such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is
excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity
analysis below. The allowance for credit losses for
predominantly all of the consumer portfolio was
measured using the Firm’s modeled approach, as the
consumer portfolio is predominantly residential real
estate that has more commonly defined risk
characteristics including loan to value ratio and
credit score, and therefore is reflected in the
sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 28 for
additional information on the First Republic
acquisition.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 80and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative
adverse scen
                                                        91                                                         
ario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment rate,
averaging approximately 1.6% higher over the eight-
quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 2.2% in
the first quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP with a
slower recovery, remaining approximately 3.1% lower at
the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak
difference of approximately 3.4% in the third quarter
of 2024; and lower national HPI with a peak difference
of approximately 10.5% in the first quarter of 2025.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including: • The allowance as of
June 30, 2023, reflects credit losses beyond those
estimated under the central scenario due to the weight
placed on the adverse scenarios. • The impacts of
changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and
nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be
simply extrapolated for more severe changes in
macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of future
changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior
can significantly affect the allowance for credit
losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss
estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of June 30,
2023, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under
its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario.
Without considering offsetting or correlated effects
in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses, the comparison between
these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect
the following differences: • An increase of
approximately $750 million for residential real estate
loans and lending-related commitments, including the
First Republic portfolios • An increase of
approximately $2.4 billion for credit card loans ▪ An
increase of approximately $3.8 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments, excluding the
First Republic portfolios. This analysis relates only
to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not
intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance
for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential
changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the
judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime
loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and
imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates
based on then-current circumstances and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions
are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the
recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its
process to consider the available information and
associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately
governed and that its estimates of expected credit
losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period
ended June 30, 2023.

Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including derivatives,
structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
including certain mortgage, home equity and other
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at
fair value The following table includes the Firm’s
assets measured at fair value and the portion of such
assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments
used to estimate fair value are more significant than
those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.
                                                                                                                   
  Credit card rewards liability                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
The credit card rewards liability was $12.2 billion
and $11.3 billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively, and is recorded in accounts
payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The increase in the liability was
predominantly driven by continued growth in rewards
points earned on higher spend and promotional offers
outpacing redemptions throughout 2023, and, to a
lesser extent, adjustments to certain reward program
terms in the second quarter. Refer to pages 151-152 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a description of
the significant assumptions and sensitivities,
associated with the Firm’s credit card rewards
liability.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
                              
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there
is no assurance that any list of risks and
uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to
differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and
political conditions and geopolitical events,
including the war in Ukraine;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting
the Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to
address those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and
scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices,
including dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and
laws;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Changes in FDIC assessments;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including
changes in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending
or savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its
capital and liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or
its subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,
environmental and sustainability concerns that may
arise, including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an
economic slowdown or other economic or market
disruption, including, but not limited to, in the
interest rate environment;

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its
counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
require the Firm to incur liabilities or absorb losses
not contemplated at their initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified
and diverse employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,
customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of
certain assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate
change or extraordinary events beyond the Firm's
control, and the Firm’s ability to deal effectively
with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational
systems or those of third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself
against cyberattacks and other attempts by
unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm
or its customers or to disrupt the Firm’s systems; and

• The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part
I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and
JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements. The reader should,
however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial
transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed
certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic acquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and
services, associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. The
Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain clients, products and services associated with the First
Republic acquisition, including deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications and
allocations may change in future periods including across the Firm's segments. Refer to Note 27 for a further
discussion of the Firm’s business segments and Note 28 for additional information on the First Republic
acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different
from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that
this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the
current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase
and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not
assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it
has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest
entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S.
GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing balances to be presented
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting
agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.
Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.
Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method
The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the
portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size
of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that
can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting
adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designate those

Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures The adoption of this guidance eliminated the
accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified
loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must
be the post-

modification effective interest rate, instead of the
pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm
elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based
allowance approach for modified loans to troubled
borrowers for all portfolios except modified
nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to
continue applying a DCF methodology. Refer to Note 13
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a description
of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the
asset-specific allowance approach. This guidance was
adopted under the modified retrospective method which
resulted in a net decrease to the allowance for credit
losses of $ 587million and an increase to retained
earnings of $ 446million, after-tax, predominantly
driven by residential real estate and credit card. The
adoption of this guidance eliminated the disclosure
requirements for TDRs including the requirement to
assess whether a modification is reasonably expected
or involves a concession. The new guidance requires
disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty consisting of
principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-
than-insignificant payment delay, term extension or a
combination of these modifications. The Firm has
defined these types of modifications as financial
difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the
elimination of the requirement to assess whether a
modification is reasonably expected or involves a
concession, the population of loans considered FDMs
will differ from those previously considered TDRs.
This guidance also requires disclosure of current
period gross charge-offs by vintage origination year.

(a) At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 93.5billion and $
73.8billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge
accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities
inventories have been included in each period presented.
                                                        105                                                        
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2023, and December
31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real
estate and other funds, were $ 956million and $ 950million, respectively. Included in these balances at June 30,
2023, and December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $ 40million and $ 43million, respectively, and other assets of
$ 916million and $ 907million, respectively.

(e) At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included $ 9.3billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, of residential
first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.8billion of commercial first-lien mortgages for both periods. Residential mortgage
loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and government agencies of
$ 3.3billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 706million, nonagency securities of $ 5million and
non-trading loans of $ 930million.

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 6million, trading loans of $ 72million and non-trading loans of $
2.2billion.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 1.0billion and non-trading loans of $ 638million.

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 843million including $ 213million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to
Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of
attributes of the underlying instruments and external
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in
the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in
level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes
in fair value) for financial instruments classified by
the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
for the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.
When a determination is made to classify a financial
instrument within level 3, the determination is based
on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the
overall fair value measurement. However, level 3
financial instruments typically include, in addition
to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable
components (that is, components that are actively
quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below
include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the
observable components of level 3 financial instruments
using securities and derivative positions that are
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk
management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect
the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities
related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2022, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 115for further information on changes impacting
items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and six months ended June 30, 2023 Level 3 assets were
$ 26.8billion at June 30, 2023, reflecting an increase of $ 3.0billion from March 31, 2023, and an increase of $
3.2billion from December 31, 2022. The increase for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 was predominantly
driven by: • $ 2.3billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively, in non-trading loans primarily due to $ 1.9billion of
loans in CIB associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to the sections below for additional
information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three
months ended June 30, 2023, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 1.2billion
of gross interest rate derivative payables as a result of transition to term SOFR for certain interest rate
options. • $ 760million of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. For the three months ended June
30, 2023, there were no significant transfers from level 3 into level 2. For the six months ended June 30, 2023,
significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 1.6billion of gross interest rate
derivative payables as a result of transition to term SOFR for certain interest rate options. • $ 901million of
gross equity derivative receivables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance
of unobservable inputs. • $ 917million of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. For the six
months ended June 30, 2023, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 1.3billion
and $ 827million of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a
result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the three
months ended June 30, 2022, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the three months
ended June 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 930million of
gross interest rate derivative receivables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the
significance of unobservable inputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 2
into level 3 included the following: • $ 1.6billion of total debt and equity instruments, largely due to equity
securities of $ 959million driven by a decrease in observability predominantly as a result of restricted access to
certain markets. • $ 1.3billion of gross equity derivative payables as a result of a decrease in observability and
an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2022, significant
transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 965million of gross interest rate derivative
receivables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs.
• $ 920million and $ 1.4billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables,
respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable
inputs. All transfers are based on changes in the observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are
assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting period in which they occur.

driven by losses in net derivative receivables due to
market movements. • $ 328million of net losses on
liabilities, driven by losses in long-term debt due to
market movements. Three months ended June 30, 2022 • $
3.4billion of net gains on assets, largely driven by
gains in net equity derivative receivables due to
market movements and MSRs reflecting lower prepayment
speeds on higher rates. • $ 2.8billion of net gains on
liabilities, predominantly driven by gains in long-
term debt due to market movements. Six months ended
June 30, 2023 • $ 139million of net gains on assets,
driven by gains in MSR reflecting lower prepayment
speeds on higher rates. • $ 1.8billion of net losses
on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in
long-term debt due to market movements. Six months

from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 3% to 56% with a weighted average of 25%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 37million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa
B shares”). These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common
shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters
involving Visa. On June 29, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the
conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.5991to 1.5902effective June 28, 2023. The
conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The
outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion
rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer
restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be.
As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to
be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.

In connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the
purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate.
Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent
changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The
payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer
restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology
based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The
derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other
income. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23million Visa B shares that the
Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
(b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money Note in
level 3 of Long-term debt associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Notes 18 and 28 for additional
information.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by
law, without notice. Refer to page 169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation
of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities,
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The
profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be
measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are
not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were not material both for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(d) Reported in other income.

(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 7 for further information
regarding interest income and interest expense.

(f) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of June 30, 2023, and December 31,
2022.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair

  Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in similar
business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic
conditions. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit
risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s
agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels
are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the
portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting
policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the
Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by
industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty
basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales,
securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.
Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular
loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and
collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for
loan losses.
                                                        122                                                        
The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the
Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The wholesale industry of risk
category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

(a) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(b) The industry rankings presented in the table as of December 31, 2022, are based on the industry rankings of the
corresponding exposures as of June 30, 2023, not actual rankings of such exposures at December 31, 2022.
(c) Individuals and Individual Entities predominantly consists of Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P.
Morgan Wealth Management within CCB, and includes exposure to personal investment companies and personal and
testamentary trusts.
(d) In addition to the credit risk exposure to states and municipal governments (both U.S. and non-U.S.) as of June
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, noted above, the Firm held: $ 6.8billion and $ 6.6billion, respectively, of trading
assets; $ 24.0billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively, of AFS securities; and $ 11.6billion and $ 19.7billion,
respectively, of HTM securities, issued by U.S. state and municipal governments. Refer to Note 2 and Note 10 for
further information.
(e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 94% and 6%,
respectively, as of June 30, 2023 and 95% and 5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 14 for more
information on exposures to SPEs.
(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $ 485.4billion and $ 556.6billion, as of June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.
(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit
portfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash
collateral held against derivative receivables.
(i) Included credit exposure associated with the First Republic acquisition consisting of $ 104.6billion in the
Consumer, excluding credit card portfolio, and $ 98.2billion in the Wholesale portfolio predominantly in Asset
Managers, Real Estate, and Individuals and Individual Entities.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

135for more information on volumes and types of credit
derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        126                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.
(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative
instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts
of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the
case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances
with that counterparty.
(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $ 52.5billion and $ 51.5billion at June 30, 2023,

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at June 30, 2023, and December
31, 2022, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features
that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which
additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The
liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating
agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied
to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

As of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets
related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income
statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 12.8billion and $ 26.0billion at June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At June 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 20.9billion and $ 20.3billion,
respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 216million and $ 221million, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the
Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a
portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. At June 30, 2023, the amortized cost of
the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 67.8billion, of which $ 49.6billion was designated as hedged.
The cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $( 1.1) billion, reflecting $( 865) million and $( 229) million for
active and discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 1 and Note 10 for additional
information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will
reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June
30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line
item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net
interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023 and 2022.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.3) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in
AOCI at June 30, 2023, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized
in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three and six months

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified
risk management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not
designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are
used to manage risks associated with certain specified
assets and liabilities, including certain risks
arising from mortgage commitments, warehouse loans,

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives
used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in
mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as
well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in
mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate
credit risk associated with lending exposures in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not
include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative
receivables, which is included in gains and losses on
derivatives related to market-making activities and
other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate
foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses
were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents Other protection purchased by CIB, primarily in its market-making businesses.
(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.
(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.
(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection.
The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings
profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The
ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are
comparable to the profile reflected below.

Principal transactions
The following table presents all realized and
unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal
transactions revenue. This table excludes interest
income and interest expense on trading assets and
liabilities, which are an integral part of the overall
performance of the Firm’s client-driven market-making
activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 7 for further
information on interest income and interest expense.
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument
type. The Firm’s client-driven market-making
businesses generally utilize a variety of instrument
types in connection with their market-making and
related risk-management activities; accordingly, the
trading revenue presented in the table below is not
representative of the total revenue of any individual
LOB.

FDIC Special Assessment

In May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking recommending a special assessment related
to the systemic risk determination made on March 12,
2023, to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund
("DIF") arising from the protection of uninsured
depositors resulting from recent bank resolutions. In
its current form, the rule would impose a special
assessment at an annual rate of 12.5 basis points on
certain banks’ estimated uninsured deposits reported
as of December 31, 2022. The Firm expects to be
subject to special assessments imposed by the FDIC to
recover losses to the DIF.

Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury
and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At June 30, 2023, the investment securities
portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Effective January 1, 2023, the
Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which permitted a transfer of HTM securities to
AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $
7.1billion resulting in the recognition of $ 38million net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. This transfer was a
noncash transaction. Refer to Note 1 and Note 21 for additional information. During 2022, the Firm transferred $
78.3billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax
unrealized losses of $ 4.8billion on the securities at the date of transfer. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio.

(a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities hedged in a closed
portfolio. Under U.S. GAAP portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual securities,
however the amounts impact the unrealized gains or losses for the individual securities being hedged. Refer to Note
1 and Note 5 for additional information.
(b) The Firm purchased $ 520million and $ 4.1billion of HTM securities for the three and six months ended June 30,

respectively.
(c) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $ 104million and
$ 96million at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
(d) Excludes $ 2.5billion of accrued interest receivable at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Firm did
not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the three and six months ended June 30,
2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of accounting policies
for accrued interest receivable on investment securities.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S. GSE
and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 6.9billion and $ 9.6billion, at June 30, 2023 and December
31, 2022, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates
rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S.
government.

HTM securities – credit risk Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM
securities is the risk rating assigned to each
security. At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all
HTM securities were rated investment grade and were
current and accruing, with approximately 99% and 98%
rated at least AA+, respectively.

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities was $ 104million and $ 47million as of June
30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which included a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
related to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS for
the six months ended June 30, 2023. Refer to Note 10
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
discussion of accounting policies for AFS and HTM

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio
hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal
prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield
is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for
credit losses of $( 30) million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 865) million at
June 30, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of
$( 74) million at June 30, 2023.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, seven yearsfor agency residential
collateralized mortgage obligations, and six yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.
(d) Includes AFS securities associated with the First Republic acquisition, primarily impacting due after 10 years.

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which
the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 25 for further information regarding assets pledged and
collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the
Firm’s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. When the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant
netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”
presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-
for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities
within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At both June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Firm held $ 692million of financial assets for which the rights
have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in accordance with U.S.
GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The transferred assets are
recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded predominantly in short-term
borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and
Vintage Disclosures accounting guidance as discussed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the
existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure requirements for
FDMs. The disclosure requirements for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Refer
to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on loan modifications prior to January 1,
2023, which were accounted for and reported as TDRs. This new guidance also requires disclosure of current period
gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio, including loans of $ 149.8billion associated with the First Republic acquisition, is
divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to determine the allowance for
loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each portfolio segment the Firm
monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the risk characteristics of each
loan class.

(b) Includes scored auto, business banking loans and overdrafts in BWM and other consumer unsecured loans in CIB.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in CCB, for
which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory
agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal
investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global
Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were
not material at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022

(b) At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent.

(c) Included $ 5.6billion, $ 26.2billion, $ 22.0billion, $ 15.0billion, $ 7.5billion, and $ 12.9billion of term
loans originated in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and prior to 2019, respectively, and $ 2.5billion of revolving
loans within the revolving period associated with the First Republic acquisition.

(d) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not
material at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee.

(e) Included $ 158million of 30+ days past due loans associated with the First Republic acquisition.

(f) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2023,
approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at June 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022.

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 44million and $ 45million and $ 89million
and $ 90million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at June 30, 2023.

(k) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(l) Included $ 4.3billion in equal to or greater than 660 FICO scores within 80% to 100% LTV ratio, and $
85.3billion and $ 1.2billion in equal to or greater than 660 and less than 660 FICO scores, respectively, within
less than 80% LTV ratio associated with the First Republic acquisition.

(m) Included $ 91.9billion of loans associated with the First Republic acquisition.

(n) Included $ 55.5billion, $ 15.2billion, $ 3.6billion and $ 8.0billion in California, New York, Florida and
Massachusetts, respectively, associated with the First Republic acquisition.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of residential
real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are
reported as FDMs. The Firm's proprietary modification
programs as well as government programs, including
U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty including, but not limited to, interest
rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-
insignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness
that would otherwise have been required under the
terms of the original agreement, are considered FDMs.
For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
residential real estate FDMs were $ 35million and $
75million, respectively. The financial effects of the
FDMs, which were largely in the form of term
extensions and interest rate reductions, included
extending the weighted-average life of the loans by
15years and 18years, and reducing the weighted-average
contractual interest rate from 6.90% to 4.21% and
6.75% to 4.01% for the three and six months ended June
30, 2023, respectively. There were noadditional
commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as
FDMs. In addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $
33million and $ 48million of loans subject to a trial
modification, and $ 3million and $ 5million of Chapter
7 loans for the three and six months ended June 30,
2023, respectively. The changes to the TDR accounting
guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and
concession assessment criteria. Accordingly, trial
modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered
TDRs, but not FDMs. For periods ending prior to
January 1, 2023, modifications of residential real
estate loans where the Firm granted concessions to
borrowers who were experiencing financial difficulty
were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. For
the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, new TDRs
were $ 115million and $ 233million, respectively.
There were no additional commitments to lend to
borrowers whose residential real estate loans have
been modified in TDRs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on
TDRs.

(a) At June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonaccrual
loans excluded $ 39million and $ 101million,
respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due
and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $ 38million and $
76million, respectively, were no longer accruing
interest based on the guidelines set by the SBA.
Typically the principal balance of the loans is
insured and interest is guaranteed at a specified
reimbursement rate subject to meeting the guidelines
set by the SBA. There were noloans that were not
guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more days past
due and still accruing interest at June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an
allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,
certain nonaccrual loans that are considered
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their
underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value
of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to
charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on
a cash basis was not material for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022 .

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are
ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding
loan balances at June 30, 2023.

Loan modifications The Firm grants certain
modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty, which effective
January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. For the three
and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, auto and
other FDMs were not material and there were
noadditional commitments to lend to borrowers modified
as FDMs. For the three and six months ended June 30,
2022, auto and other TDRs were not material.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which
effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card under
long-term programs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan
continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In
most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.
The following tables provide information on credit card loan modifications considered FDMs.

For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
the Firm also had $ 26million of loans subject to
trial modifications. The changes to the TDR accounting
guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and
concession assessment criteria. A ccordingly, trial
modifications are not considered FDMs.

There were $ 6million FDMs that re-defaulted during
both the three and six months ended June 30, 2023
which were a combination of term extension and
interest rate reduction. For credit card loans
modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to have
occurred when the borrower misses twoconsecutive
contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card
loans remain in the modification program and continue
to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's
standard charge-off policy. For periods ending prior
to January 1, 2023, modifications of credit card loans
where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who
were experiencing financial difficulty were generally
accounted for and reported as TDRs. Refer to Note 12
of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on TDRs.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients,
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

Internal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans. The following tables

(a) Represents FDMs that were 30 days or more past due
Additional commitments to lend to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty whose Commercial and
industrial loans have been modified as FDMs were $
438million and $ 1.3billion for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2023.

There were noadditional commitments to lend to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulties whose
Other loans have been modified as FDMs for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2023.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2023,
Secured by real estate FDMs were $ 77million and $
85million respectively. The financial effects of FDMs
were largely term extensions which extended the loans
by a weighted-average of nine months. There were nore-
defaults during the three months ended June 30, 2023
and $ 1million in modified term extensions that re-
defaulted during the six months ended June 30, 2023.
There were noadditional commitments to lend to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose
loans have been modified as FDMs for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2023.

Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications
were considered TDRs.

For the three and six months ended June 30, 2022, new
TDRs were $ 60million and $ 479million, respectively.
New TDRs for the three and six months ended June 30,
2022 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant
waivers primarily in the Commercial and Industrial
loan class. For the three and six months ended June
30, 2022, the impact of these modifications were not
material to the Firm.

As a result of the elimination of the requirement to
assess whether a modification is reasonably expected
or involves a concession, the population of loans
considered FDMs is greater than those previously
considered TDRs.

  Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. On January
1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments -
Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting
guidance as described in Note 1. The adoption of this
guidance eliminated the requirement to measure the
allowance for TDRs using a DCF methodology and allowed
the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for
modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied for
these modified loans, the discount rate must be the
post-modification effective interest rate, instead of
the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm
elected to change from an asset-specific allowance
approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance
approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for
all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and
nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-
specific allowance approach will continue to apply.
This guidance was adopted under the modified
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease
to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587million and
an increase to retained earnings of $ 446million,
after-tax predominantly driven by residential real
estate and credit card. Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of
the allowance for credit losses and the related
accounting policies.

(b) At June 30, 2023, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had an
allowance for credit losses of $ 18million associated with certain accounts receivable in CIB.
(c) As of June 30, 2023 included $ 1.2billion allowance for credit losses associated with the First Republic
acquisition.
(d) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably
expected TDRs and modified PCD loans.
(e) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(f) At June 30, 2023 and 2022, lending-related commitments excluded $ 18.4billion and $ 13.7billion, respectively,
for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 881.5billion and $ 774.0billion, respectively, for the
credit card portfolio segment; and $ 19.3billion and $ 29.1billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio
segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments. Prior period amount for wholesale
lending-related commitments, including the amount not subject to allowance, has been revised to conform with the
current presentation.

Discussion of changes in the allowance

The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2023 was $ 24.3billion, reflecting a net addition of $ 2.7billion
from December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $ 1.5billion, consisting of: •
$ 819million in wholesale , predominantly driven by net downgrade activity, updates to certain assumptions related
to office real estate in CB in the second quarter of 2023, and the impact of the additional weight placed on the
adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, and • $ 649million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card
Services, reflecting loan growth, the net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook, including the
impact from the weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking in the third quarter of 2024, and the additional
weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, partially offset by reduced borrower
uncertainty. The net addition also included $ 1.2billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans
and lending-related commitments in the second quarter of 2023. The Firm has maintained the additional weight placed
on the relative adverse scenario in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting an increased probability of a moderate
recession due to tightening financial conditions. The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $
587million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. Refer to Note
1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five
internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors
than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment
rate peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.5% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the fourth quarter of
2024.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-
sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act
as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        165                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests.

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of
business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests
in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 12.4billion and
$ 13.8billion of the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30,
2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, which have
been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.
Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated
under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide
liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide
lending-related commitments to certain clients of the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded
commitments were $ 11.3billion and $ 10.6billion at
June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively,
and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend
credit. Refer to Note 24 for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal
bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option
bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance
their municipal bond investments at short-term rates.
TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and
non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are
sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor
for all non-customer TOB transactions.

2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or
custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does
not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate
the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would
record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds
investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and
operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party
is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated
to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $
32.4billion and $ 30.2billion at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of which $ 12.6billion and $ 10.6billion was
unfunded at June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the
risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 5.9billion and
$ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at both June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022
was $ 8.2billion. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential
mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to

Ginnie Mae guidelines

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or
guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying
these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated
to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 24 of this
Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and
Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to
the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due
to material breaches of representations and warranties
as discussed in Note 24, the Firm also has the option
to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S.
government

agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm
typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from
Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them
and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance
with the applicable requirements, and such loans
continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s
repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must
be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a
loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12
for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022. Substantially all of these loans
and real estate are insured or guaranteed by U.S.
government agencies.

Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
year, or more often if events or circumstances, such
as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate
that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.
Unanticipated declines in business performance,
increases in credit losses, increases in capital
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of
equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the
Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which
could result in a material impairment charge to
earnings in a future period related to some portion of
the associated goodwill. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm
reviewed current economic conditions, estimated market
cost of equity, as well as actual business results and
projections of business performance. Based on such
reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not
impaired as of June 30, 2023, or December 31, 2022,
nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during
the six months ended June 30, 2023 or 2022.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022.

(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result
of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.
(b) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities
(“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the
Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.
(c) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(d) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g.,
cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and outlines
hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to
immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as
defined below.

(a) As of June 30, 2023 , reflects the Purchase Money Note associated with the First Republic acquisition. Refer to
Note 28 for additional information.

(b) Included long-term debt of $ 87.7billion and $ 13.8billion secured by assets totaling $ 221.2billion and $
208.3billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively. The amount of long-term debt secured by assets
does not include amounts related to hybrid instruments.

(c) Included $ 78.6billion and $ 72.3billion of long-term debt accounted for at fair value at June 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022 , respectively.

(d) Included $ 11.2billion and $ 10.3billion of outstanding zero-coupon notes at June 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022 , respectively. The aggregate principal amount of these notes at their respective maturities is $ 45.7billion
and $ 45.3billion, respectively. The aggregate principal amount reflects the contractual principal payment at
maturity, which may exceed the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date, if applicable.

(e) Included on the Consolidated balance sheets in beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs. Also included
amounts accounted for at fair value which were not material at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 . Excluded
short-term commercial paper and other short-term beneficial interests of $ 18.5billion and $ 10.5billion at June
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 , respectively.

(f) The interest rates shown are the weighted average of contractual rates in effect at June 30, 2023 and December
31, 2022 , respectively, including non-U.S. dollar fixed- and variable-rate issuances, which excludes the effects
of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if applicable. The interest rates
shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.

(g) As of June 30, 2023, included $ 25.0billion of FHLB advances associated with the First Republic acquisition.
Refer to Note 28 for additional information.

(h) As of June 30, 2023 , long-term debt in the aggregate of $ 191.7billion was redeemable at the option of
JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.

(i) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the 12-month periods ending June 30, 2024, 2025,
2026, 2027 and 2028 is $ 41.9billion, $ 58.5billion, $ 38.0billion, $ 29.2billion and $ 75.2billion, respectively.
                                                        175                                                        
The weighted-average contractual interest rates for
total long-term debt excluding structured notes
accounted for at fair value were 3.45% and 3.26% as of
June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. In
order to modify exposure to interest rate and currency
exchange rate movements, JPMorgan Chase utilizes
derivative instruments, primarily interest rate and
cross-currency interest rate swaps, in conjunction
with some of its debt issuances. The use of these
instruments modifies the Firm’s interest expense on
the associated debt. The modified weighted-average
interest rates for total long-term debt, including the
effects of related derivative instruments, were 5.02%
and 4.89% as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. JPMorgan Chase & Co. has guaranteed
certain long-term debt of its subsidiaries, including
structured notes. These guarantees rank pari passu
with the Firm’s other unsecured and unsubordinated
indebtedness. The amount of such guaranteed long-term
debt and structured notes was $ 34.5billion and $
28.2billion at June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. The Firm’s unsecured debt does not
contain requirements that would call for an
acceleration of payments, maturities or changes in the
structure of the existing debt, provide any
limitations on future borrowings or require additional
collateral, based on unfavorable changes in the Firm’s
credit ratings, financial ratios, earnings or stock
price.

Note 23 – Regulatory capital

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes
similar minimum capital requirements and standards for
the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI
subsidiaries are also subject to these capital
requirements established by their respective primary
regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios
to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were
subject as of June 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

CECL regulatory capital transition

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL
capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out
at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of June
30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the
remaining $ 1.4billion benefit associated with the
CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm
phased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition
provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as
applicable.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on CECL capital transition
provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30,
2023, and December 31, 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored
business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has
not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of
commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper
facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well
as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose
facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition
financings, trade financings and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other
financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2023, and December 31, 2022.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant
Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card
transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the
Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge
back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will
bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding
future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes
a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.
                                                        186                                                        
Loan sales and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold
meet certain requirements, and that may require the
Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the
loan purchaser if such representations and warranties
are breached by the Firm. The liability related to
repurchase demands associated with private label
securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in
establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 26
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for additional information regarding
litigation. Sponsored member repo program The Firm
acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements
through the Government Securities Division of the
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf
of clients that become sponsored members under the
FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the
prompt and full payment and performance of its
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under
the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability
under these guarantees by obtaining a security
interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing
house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to
be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure,
without taking into consideration the associated
collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing
house guarantees and commitments line on page 185.
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for additional information on credit risk mitigation
practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.
Guarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has
guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes
of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase
Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 185 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional
information.

it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.

Contingencies

As of June 30, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The
litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially
millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal
proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at
varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and
several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory
antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm
believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for
its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.3billion at June 30, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the
Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not
believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of
multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous
yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of
many of the claims, and • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where
the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition,
the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate
because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the
aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary
significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P.
Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia
Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was
served in August 2022. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to
payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an
account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and
PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of
service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB discontinued its claim
against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but requested permission of the Court to refile in the future, which the Court
took under consideration. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India
Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by
JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017,
numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to
delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the
Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private
Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the
Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including
unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain
currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s
Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED
attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA
investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation. Foreign Exchange
Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities
relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities.
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely
on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)
                                                        188                                                        
through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related
governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South
Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class
action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an
alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted
in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court
to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. The District
Court denied certification of a putative class action against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf
of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary judgment
against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition, some FX-
related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside
the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the
UK actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal
Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in
principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains subject to court approval. Interchange
Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of class action complaints alleging that
Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of credit and debit card interchange fees
and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the parties initially settled the cases for a
cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded to the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of New York. The original class action was divided into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily
monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In September 2018, the parties to the monetary
class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this
settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $ 900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion
previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December 2019, the amended settlement agreement was
approved by the District Court. In March 2023, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed
the District Court’s approval of the settlement, and two merchants have filed petitions for rehearing of the
Appellate Court’s approval. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $
700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement
agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted
plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of the merchants who opted out
of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations
against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain
pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately 65% of
the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. was named as a defendant in twolawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex
trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was
filed in November 2022, was a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the
other case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin
Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. In March 2023, the Court granted in part and
denied in part JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s motions to dismiss these complaints, allowing some claims to proceed in
both lawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm’s
former employee, James Edward Staley, into the twolawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification, contribution,
breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the faithless servant doctrine. In May 2023, the Court denied Staley’s
motion to dismiss the impleader complaints. In June 2023, the Court granted the putative class’ motion for class
certification and granted a preliminary approval of a settlement between the class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
pursuant to which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. will pay $ 290million to a fund for Epstein survivors. The actions
involving the government of the United States Virgin Islands and Staley are proceeding. LIBOR and Other Benchmark
Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies
and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other
bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and
other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal
of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.
                                                        189                                                        
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps
sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period
that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of
individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were
engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based
consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss.
The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore
Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022,
while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. Securities Lending Antitrust
Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan
Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and
New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange
trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs
have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants have opposed. The parties have reached an agreement
in principle to settle this action, subject to final documentation and court approval. Shareholder Litigation .
Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf
of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former
officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the
precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions
with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a
resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative
suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities
which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion
to dismiss this action in full, and in January 2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, which remains pending.
A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of
fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence
litigation because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. In
addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the
putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or misleading because
they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have
moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. A separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March
2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty
and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise
adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements which were the subject of
resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the
amended complaint is pending. Twoshareholder derivative suits were filed in May and June 2023, respectively, in the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust
enrichment based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors and James Dimon to exercise adequate oversight
with respect to the Firm’s provision of banking services to Jeffrey Epstein. These actions allege that the
shareholders are excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile.
These actions were consolidated and defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint filed by the plaintiffs.
* * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named
as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it
has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it
intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future.
The Firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance
with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is
probable
                                                        190                                                        
that such a liability has been incurred and the amount
of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm
evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each
quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes
adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as
appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after
consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense
was $ 420million and $ 73million for the three months
ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There is
no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will
not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the
inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal
proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek
very large or indeterminate damages, or where the
matters present novel legal theories, involve a large
number of parties or are in early stages of discovery,
the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the
eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters,
the timing of their ultimate resolution or the
eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences
related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes,
based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the
material legal proceedings described above and after
taking into account its current litigation reserves
and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses,
that the other legal proceedings currently pending
against it should not have a material adverse effect
on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The
Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is
no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it
has currently accrued or that a matter will not have
material reputational consequences. As a result, the
outcome of a particular matter may be material to
JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular
period, depending on, among other factors, the size of
the loss or liability imposed and the level of
JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

  Note 27 – Business segments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S.
GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and
tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed
basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At
least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a
result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. As of June 30, 2023, the Firm updated its line of business
capital allocations to reflect the impact of the First Republic acquisition. Refer to Line of business equity on
page 93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank
(the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver,
for $ 67.9billion, resulting in an estimated bargain
purchase gain of $ 2.7billion recorded in other
income. The estimated bargain purchase gain represents
the excess of the estimated fair value of the net
assets acquired above the purchase price. The First
Republic acquisition further advances the Firm's
wealth management strategy and is complementary to the
Firm's existing franchises. The Firm has determined
that this acquisition constitutes a business
combination under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial
recognition of the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed were generally measured at their estimated
fair values as of May 1, 2023. The determination of
those fair values required management to make certain
market-based assumptions about expected future cash
flows, discount rates and other valuation inputs at
the time of the acquisition. The Firm believes that
the fair value estimates of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed provide a reasonable basis for
determining the estimated bargain purchase gain. The
Firm and the FDIC have not yet completed the
settlement process under which the purchase price, and
the identification of the assets acquired and
liabilities assumed, will be finalized. The
finalization of this settlement process may impact the
amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain. The
purchase and assumption agreement entered into with
the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a
year after the acquisition date. In addition, the
purchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain
could change pending management's finalization of its
acquisition date fair value estimates for certain of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (such as
loans and commitments, intangible assets and leases),
which may take place up to one year from the
acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. In
connection with the First Republic acquisition, the
Firm and the FDIC entered into twoshared-loss
agreements with respect to certain loans and lending-
related commitments (the "shared-loss assets"): the
Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement ("CSLA") and the
Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement (“SFSLA”). The
CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a pari-passu
basis, over 5years with a subsequent 3-yearrecovery
period for certain acquired commercial loans and other
real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers 80% of credit
losses, on a pari-passu basis, for 7years for certain
acquired loans secured by mortgages on real property
or shares in cooperative property constituting a
primary residence. The indemnification assets which
represent the fair value of the CSLA and SFSLA are
reflected in the total assets acquired.

As part of the consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase
issued a five-year, $ 50billion secured note to the
FDIC (the "Purchase Money Note"). The Purchase Money
Note bears interest at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is
secured by certain of the acquired loans. The Purchase
Money Note is prepayable upon notice to the FDIC. The
Firm had placed a $ 5billion deposit with First
Republic Bank on March 16, 2023, as part of $
30billion of deposits provided by a consortium of
large U.S. banks. The Firm's $ 5billion deposit was
effectively settled as part of the acquisition and the
associated allowance for credit losses was released
upon closing. The Firm subsequently repaid the
remaining $ 25billion of deposits to the consortium of
banks, including accrued interest through the payment
date on May 9, 2023.

The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the
following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss
agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances.

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation
methodologies for securities, loans, deposits, and lending-related commitments.

Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer relationship
intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic transaction. The core deposit intangible of $ 1.3billion
was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the
favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the
cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available
to market participants. The customer relationship intangibles of $ 187million were valued by discounting estimated
after-tax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible
asset valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair
values, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the
relationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a
projected period of future cash flows of approximately 7years. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying values of the core
deposit and customer relationship intangibles were $ 1.2billion and $ 183million, respectively, reflecting
accumulated amortization of approximately $ 30million and $ 4million, respectively. Indemnification assets -
Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the FDIC associated with the
shared-loss assets over the respective shared loss recovery periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at
fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the acquisition date. The fair values of the
indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the forecasted losses underlying the related allowance
for credit losses.
                                                        195                                                        
The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the indemnification assets will be based on changes in amount and timing
of forecasted losses in the allowance for credit losses associated with the shared loss assets and will be recorded
in other income. Under certain circumstances, the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon
termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss
assets. The estimated potential future payment is reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase
price consideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB advances The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on
the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted cash
flow methodology and incorporated estimated market discount rates. The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are
recorded in short-term borrowings and in long-term debt. The fair value of the FHLB advances was based on a
discounted cash flow methodology and considered the observed FHLB advance issuance rates.

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information

Included in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and net
income contributed by First Republic since the acquisition date of May 1, 2023 of $ 3.1billion, $ 897million and $
2.4billion, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2023.
The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including recognition
of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion and the provision for credit losses of $ 1.2billion.
Additional adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and accreting
certain estimated fair value adjustments related to intangible assets and loans.
The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that
are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the
historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the
results of operations in future periods, particularly in light of recent changes in market and economic conditions.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan

  Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements                                                                
                                                                                                                   
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of June 30, 2023, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
three-month and six-month periods ended June 30,2023
and 2022 and the consolidated statements of cash flows
for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2023 and
2022, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “interim financial statements”).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the accompanying
interim financial statements for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein),
and in our report dated February 21, 2023, which
included a paragraph describing a change in the manner
of accounting for credit losses on certain financial
instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In
our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as
of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the consolidated
balance sheet from which it has been derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.

An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.
                                                                                                                   
  Combined LTV ratio

positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest
                                                        202                                                        
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the
loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast,
which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully
amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance
and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and

interest has been in default for a period of 90 days
or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in
the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans
are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

“Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum
capital requirements, defines eligible capital
instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

“Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market
discipline through disclosure requirements which allow
market participants to assess the risk and capital
profiles of banks.

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in client-
driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven
market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities
(including physical commodities inventories and
financial instruments that reference commodities).
Principal transactions revenue also includes certain
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to
hedge accounting and specified risk-management
activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a

Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services
rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance
over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating
represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds.
A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating
and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked
funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a
weighted average of the performance associated with a
fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable)
Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds,
separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based
on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds
with fewer than three years of history are not rated
and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings,
the assigned peer
                                                        207                                                        
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star
rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The
performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three,
and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive
these rankings are sourced from the fund rating
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-
fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable,
the fund rating providers redenominate asset values
into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on
fund performance and associated peer rankings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a
“primary share class” level to represent the quartile
ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and
at the fund level for all other funds. The performance
data may have been different if all share classes had
been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.

Iran threat reduction disclosure

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction
and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added
Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or
quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of
its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain
activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran
or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to
certain Executive Orders. Disclosure may be required
even where the activities, transactions or dealings
were conducted in compliance with applicable law. As
of the date of this report, the Firm is not aware of
any activity, transaction or dealing by any of its
affiliates during the quarter ended June 30, 2023 that
requires disclosure under Section 219.

During the first quarter of 2023, a foreign-
incorporated subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
processed a transaction in the amount of EUR 9.90 for
its client, a non-U.S. subsidiary of a U.S. insurance
provider, where the transaction originated from an
external account held by an individual designated
under 31 C.F.R. Part 594. The transaction, which was
received into the client’s account held at the
foreign-incorporated subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &
Co., was for the premium of a non-life insurance
product that is now suspended and no funds were made
available to the designated individual. The
transaction was processed in error. JPMorgan Chase &
Co. charged a fee of $0.006 for this transaction.
JPMorgan Chase & Co. does not intend to engage in such
transactions in the future.
