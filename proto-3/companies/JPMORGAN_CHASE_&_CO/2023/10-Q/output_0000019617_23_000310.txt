first quarter of 2022, unless otherwise specified. Firmwide overview For the first quarter of 2023, JPMorgan Chase
reported net income of $12.6 billion, up 52%, earnings per share of $4.10, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 23%. • Total net
revenue was $38.3 billion, up 25%, reflecting: – Net interest income of $20.7 billion, up 49%, driven by higher
rates, partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and lower average deposit balances. Net interest
income excluding Markets was $20.9 billion, up 78%. – Noninterest revenue was $17.6 billion, up 5%, driven by
higher principal transactions revenue in Markets, predominantly offset by higher net investment

securities losses in Treasury and CIO, lower Investment Banking fees, lower auto operating lease income and lower
production revenue in Home Lending. – Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower Markets NII, predominantly
offset by higher NIR. • Noninterest expense was $20.1 billion, up 5%, driven by higher structural expense and
continued investments in the business, primarily compensation expense reflecting headcount growth and wage
inflation, as well as the impact of the increase in the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" FDIC") assessment
that was announced in 2022 , partially offset by lower auto lease depreciation. • The provision for credit losses
was $2.3 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.1 billion to the allowance for credit losses and $1.1 billion of
net c harge-offs. T he net addition to the allowance for credit losses was predominantly driven by a deterioration
in the Firm's weighted-average economic outlook, including the impact from changes to the Firm's macroeconomic
scenarios and increased probability of a moderate recession due to tightening financial conditions, and consisted
of: – $726 million in wholesale, which also reflected net downgrade activity, and $416 million in consumer. Net c
harge-offs were up $555 million predominan tly driven by CCB, reflecting continued normalization in delinquencies.
The prior year included a $902 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of $582
million. • The total allowance for credit losses was $22.8 billion at March 31, 2023. The Firm had an allowance for
loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of 1.85%, compared with 1.69% in the prior year. • The Firm’s
nonperforming assets totaled $7.4 billion at March 31, 2023, a net decrease of $1.2 billion, predominantly driven
by lower consumer nonaccrual loans, reflecting paydowns and loan sales, and lower nonperforming derivative
receivables. • Firmwide average loans of $1.1 trillion were up 6%, driven by higher loans in CB, CCB and CIB,
partially offset by lower loans in AWM. • Firmwide average deposits of $2.3 trillion were down 8%, predominantly
driven by: – declines in CIB and CB due to attrition and in AWM due to migration into higher-yielding investments
as a result of the rising interest rate environment, partially offset by net issuances of structured notes in CIB ,
– a decline in CCB from existing accounts primarily due to migration to higher-yielding investments and increased
customer spending, and
                                                         5                                                         
– an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
ongoing international consumer initiatives .

Period-end deposits were up reflecting inflows in
March 2023 as a result of disruptions in the market
related to recent bank failures.

• CET1 capital was $227 billion, and the Standardized
and Advanced CET1 ratios were 13.8% and 13.9%,
respectively.

• SLR was 5.9%.

• TBVPS grew 10%, ending the first quarter of 2023 at
$76.69.

• As of March 31, 2023, the Firm had average eligible
High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of approximately
$732 billion and unencumbered marketable securities
with a fair value of approximately $700 billion,
resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of liquidity
sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
42-47 for additional information.

• On May 1, 2023, the Firm acquired the substantial
majority of assets and assumed the deposits and
certain other liabilities of First Republic Bank from
the FDIC (the “Acquisition”). The Firm believes that
the Acquisition will be accretive to earnings, will
help to further advance the Firm’s wealth management
strategy, and is expected to be complementary to the
Firm’s existing franchises.

The FDIC will provide loss sharing agreements with
respect to the following loans acquired in the
Acquisition: 80% of losses on single-family
residential mortgage loans will be covered for seven
years, and 80% of losses on commercial loans will be
covered for five years.

The Firm is estimating the impact that the Acquisition
will have on its financial statements, and expects to
record an estimated $2.6 billion post-tax bargain
purchase gain in connection with the Acquisition. The
Firm also expects to recognize restructuring costs of
approximately $2.0 billion over the course of 2023 and
2024. The Firm expects that these estimates will be
further refined over the purchase accounting
measurement period.

The Firm will repay the $25 billion of deposits placed
by large U.S. banks with First Republic Bank on March
16, 2023. The Firm will eliminate its $5 billion
deposit in consolidation and release the associated
allowance for credit losses.

The financial information and other disclosures
contained in this Form 10-Q do not give effect to the
Acquisition. Refer to Note 26 for additional
information concerning the Acquisition.

• On March 24, 2023, JPMorgan Chase obtained final
approval from China’s State Administration for Market
Regulation to complete its acquisition of China
International Fund Management Co., Ltd. ("CIFM").

• On March 22, 2023, JPMorgan Chase announced that it
had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire
Aumni, a provider of investment analytics software.
                                                                                                                   
  Outlook                                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
These current expectations are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form
10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on
page 78, and page 154 and Risk Factors on pages 9-32
of the Firm’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion
of certain of those risks and uncertainties and the
other factors that could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual
results to differ materially because of those risks
and uncertainties. There is no assurance that actual
results in 2023 will be in line with the outlook
information set forth below, and the Firm does not
undertake to update any forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023
should be viewed against the backdrop of the global
and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the
geopolitical environment, the competitive environment,
client and customer activity levels, and regulatory
and legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The
Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates.

The Firm expects to be subject to a special assessment
by the FDIC as a result of the estimated losses
incurred by the Deposit Insurance Fund from recent
bank failures. The FDIC has expressed its intent to
issue a notice of proposed rulemaking related to the
special assessment in May 2023.

The full-year 2023 outlook does not include the
effects of the First Republic Bank acquisition.
                                                                                                                   
  Full-year 2023                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
• Management expects both net interest income and net
interest income excluding Markets to be approximately
$81 billion, market dependent.

approximately $81 billion, market dependent and
excluding any FDIC special assessment.

Services to be approximately 2.6%.

Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors on pages 9-32
of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K and Part II, Item
1A, Risk Factors on page 177 of this Form 10-Q for a
discussion of material risk factors that could affect
the Firm. These risk factors include potential impacts
to the Firm associated with current market and
economic conditions, including inflationary pressures,
rapidly rising interest rates, the failure of market
participants and geopolitical tensions (including
secondary effects of the war in Ukraine), any or all
of which could result in additional market disruption,
government actions (including with respect to monetary
policies), ongoing impacts to global supply chains,
and other geopolitical risks.

The Firm and other market participants are preparing
for the final stages of the transition from the use of
the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other
IBORs in accordance with the International
Organization of Securities Commission’s standards for
transaction-based benchmark rates. The cessation of
the publication of the remaining principal tenors of
U.S. dollar LIBOR (i.e., overnight, one-month, three-
month, six-month and 12-month LIBOR) (“LIBOR
Cessation”) is scheduled for June 30, 2023. On April
3, 2023, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
announced that the one-month, three-month and six-
month tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR will continue to be
published on a "synthetic" basis, which will allow
market participants to use such rates for certain
legacy LIBOR-linked contracts through September 30,
2024.

On March 1, 2023, the Firm announced that, after June
30, 2023, CME Term SOFR will be the replacement
reference rate for certain outstanding floating rate
and fixed-to-floating rate debt securities, preferred
stock and certificates of deposit issued by JPMorgan
Chase and certain of its subsidiaries that use U.S.
dollar LIBOR as the reference rate and that are
governed by New York or Delaware law. The Firm is
prepared to participate in initiatives by the
principal central counterparties (“CCPs”) to convert
cleared derivatives contracts linked to U.S. dollar
LIBOR in the second quarter of 2023. The Firm
continues its client outreach with respect to U.S.
dollar LIBOR-linked products and continues to monitor
and evaluate client, industry, market, regulatory and
legislative developments. Refer to Business
Developments on page 50 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form

(a) Included operating lease income of $755 million and $1.0 billion for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and
2022, respectively. Also includes losses on tax-oriented investments. Refer to Note 5 for additional information.
Quarterly results Investment banking fees decreased in CIB, reflecting lower debt underwriting fees as challenging
market conditions resulted in lower issuance activity. Refer to C IB segment results on pages 23-27 and Note 5 for
additional information. Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting: • higher net revenue in Fixed Income
Markets, driven by Rates benefiting from favorable market conditions early in the quarter and elevated volatility
in March 2023 , as well as in Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing, partially offset by lower revenue in
Currencies & Emerging Markets compared to a strong prior year , • in Equity Markets, higher revenue in principal
transactions, particularly in Prime Finance and Equity Derivatives, which was more than offset by losses in net
interest income, • a loss of $153 million in Credit Adjustments & Other in CIB, compared with a loss of $524
million in the prior year, and • net gains on certain legacy private equity investments in Corporate, compared with
net losses in the prior year. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has offsets across other revenue
lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its CIB Markets business on a total net
revenue basis. Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages 23-27 and pages 33-34, respectively, and Note 5
for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees decr eased due to lower cash management fees in CB and CIB associated with the
higher level of credits earned by clients that reduce such fees. Refer to CIB and CB segment results on pages
23-27, pages 28-29 and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management fees decreased driven by lower average
market levels and lower performance fees, partially offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers in
AWM, and to a lesser extent, the impact of lower market levels in CCB. Refer to AWM segment results on pages 30-32
and Note 5 for additional information. Commissions and other fees: refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages
23-27 and pages 30-32 and Note 5 for additional information. Investment securities losses reflected higher net
losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the
investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. R efer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34 and Note 9
for additional information. Mortgage fees and related income decreased driven by Home Lending, reflecting lower
production revenue from a decline in volume, and lower net mortgage servicing revenue due to a net loss compared
with a net gain in the prior year in MSR risk management. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 20-22 and Notes 5
and 14 for additional information. Card income increased driven by: • higher net interchange income largely due to
a reduction in rewards costs and partner payments related to a periodic tax refund on airline miles redeemed, and
higher annual fees, partially offset by higher amortization related to new account origination costs in CCB, and •
higher payments-related revenue on volume growth in Commercial Card in CIB. Refer to CCB and CIB segment results on
pages 20-22 and pages 23-27 and Note 5 for additional information. Other income de creased reflecting: • the
absence of a gain on an equity investment in the prior year in CIB, • lower auto operating lease income in CCB from
a decline in volume, and • the absence of proceeds from an insurance settlement in the prior year, partially offset
by • a gain of $339 million in AWM on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the
remaining 51% interest in the entity.
                                                        10                                                         
Net interest income increased driven by higher rates , partially offset by lower Markets net interest income and
lower average deposit balances. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.2 trillion, down $185 billion,
and the yield was 4.68%, up 282 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.63%, an
increase of 96 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.80%, up 185 bps. Refer to the Consolidated average
balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on page 167 for further information. Net yield excluding Markets is a
non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 16-17 for a further discussion of Net yield excluding Markets.

Quarterly results The provision for credit losses was
$2.3 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.1
billion to the allowance for credit losses and $1.1
billion of net charge-offs. The net addition to the
allowance for credit losses was predominantly driven
by a deterioration in the Firm's weighted-average
economic outlook, including the impact from changes to
the Firm’s macroeconomic scenarios and increased
probability of a moderate recession due to tightening
financial conditions, and consisted of: • $726 million
in wholesale, which also reflected net downgrade
activity, and an addition to the allowance for credit
losses associated with Other assets in Corporate, and
• $416 million in consumer . Net charge-offs increased
$555 million, predominantly driven by CCB, reflecting
continued normalization in delinquencies. The prior
year included a $902 million net addit ion to the
allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of
$582 million. Refer to CC B segment results on pages
20-22 , CIB on pages 23-27, CB on pages 28-29, AWM on

(a) Includes depreciation expense associated with auto
operating lease assets. (b) Included Firmwide legal
expense of $176 million and $119 million for the three
months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.
Quarterly results Compensation expense increased
driven by additional headcount, primarily in
technology and operations, as well as front office,
and the impact of wage inflation, partially offset by
lower revenue-related compensation in CIB.
Noncompensation expense was flat and primarily
included : • higher investments in the business,
including marketing and technology, and • higher
structural expense, including the impact of the
increase in the FDIC assessment that was announced in
2022, offset by • lower volume-related expense,
reflecting lower depreciation expense on lower Auto
lease assets.

Quarterly results The effective tax rate increased
driven by a higher level of pre-tax income that
decreased the relative net impact of certain tax
benefits and expenses, and the mix of income and
expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local
taxes, as well as lower benefits related to the
vesting of employee share based awards in the current
period.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased primarily as a result of Markets activities,
partially offset by the impact of higher deposits.
Deposits with banks reflect the Firm’s placement of
its excess cash with various central banks, including
the Federal Reserve Banks.

Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven activities and higher
demand for securities to cover short positions.

Refer to Note 10 for information on securities
purchased under resale agreements and securities
borrowed.

Trading assets increased due to higher levels of debt
and equity instruments in Markets, reflecting strong
client-driven market-making activities, including in
the U.S. Treasury market, and when compared with the
seasonally lower levels at year-end. Refer to Notes 2
and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities decreased primarily due to
maturities and paydowns of U.S. Treasuries and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS in both available-for-
sale (“AFS”) and held-to-maturity (“HTM”) securities.
The decrease in AFS was also due to net sales,
partially offset by the transfer of securities from
HTM to AFS.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 33-34,
Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 66, and
Notes 2 and 9 for additional information.

Loans were relatively flat , and included:

• lower wholesale loans in CIB,

• lower balances in Card Services, reflecting the
impact of seasonality, and

• lower securities-based lending in AWM,

predominantly offset by

• higher revolver utilization and originations in CB.

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a
net addition of $914 million to the allowance for loan
losses, predominantly driven by a deterioration in the
Firm's weighted-average economic outlook, including
the impact from changes to the Firm’s macroeconomic
scenarios and increased probability of a moderate
recession due to tightening financial conditions,
consisting of:

• $499 million in wholesale , which also reflected net
downgrade activity , and $415 million in consumer .

The allowance for loan losses also reflected a
reduction of $587 million as a result of the adoption
of the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled
Debt Restructurings accounting guidance. References in
this Form 10-Q to "changes to the TDR accounting
guidance" pertain to the Firm's adoption of this
guidance.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 48-66, and Notes 2, 3, 11 and 12 for additional
information on loans and the total allowance for
credit losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable decreased
primarily due to lower receivables in Payments related
to the timing of processing payment activities, with
December 31, 2022 falling on a weekend.
                                                        13                                                         
Premises and equipment : refer to Note 16 for
information on leases.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangibles increased due to
higher other intangibles and goodwill as a result of
the Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest
in CIFM. Refer to Note 14 for additional information.

Deposits increased, reflecting inflows in March 2023,
primarily in CCB and CB, as a result of disruptions in
the market related to recent bank failures, which
changed the outflow trend that started in the second
half of 2022. AWM also experienced deposit inflows in
March which were more than offset by migration to
higher-yielding investments by month end. The increase
in period-end deposits also reflected:

• net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a result
of client demand , and

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
ongoing international consumer initiatives.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements in creased due to higher
secured financing of trading assets and the impact of
a lower level of netting on client-driven market-
making activities in Markets.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 42-47 for
additional information on deposits, federal funds
purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings ; and
also to Notes 2 and 15 for deposits and Note 10 for
federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven
market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets,
which resulted in higher levels of short positions in
debt instruments, partially offset by lower derivative
payables as a result of market movements. Refer to
Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased due
to lower client payables related to client-driven
activities in Markets, as well as lower payables in
Payments related to the timing of processing payment
activities, with December 31, 2022 falling on a
weekend.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
increased driven by higher levels of Firm-administered
multi-seller conduit commercial paper held by third
parties. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
42-47 and Notes 13 and 22 for add itional information,
specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.

Operating activities • In 2023, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and lower accounts payable and other
liabilities, partially offset by lower other assets and accrued interest and accounts receivable. • In 2022, cash
used resulted from higher trading assets, and accrued interest and accounts receivable, largely offset by higher
accounts payable and other liabilities and trading liabilities. Investing activities • In 2023, cash provided
primarily reflected net proceeds from investment securities. • In 2022, cash used resulted from higher securities
purchased under resale agreements, net purchases of investment securities, and higher net originations of loans.

Financing activities • In 2023, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements and deposits, partially offset by net payments on long- and short-term borrowings. • In 2022, cash
provided reflected higher deposits and securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from
long- and short-term borrowings. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and cash
dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 13-14,

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 79-83.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

The following summary tables provide a reconciliation
from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed
basis.

  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
                            
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four
major reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In
addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 16-17 for a definition of managed
basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least
an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various
business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and
its investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products
and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the
participating business segments may agree to share
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related
product or service, with allocations to the other
segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment
results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and
CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics
of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet
products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect
economic conditions and other factors, which may
impact the allocation of net interest income to the
segments.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these
risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management
on pages 67-72 for additional information.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business
segment is referred to as equity. At least annually,
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change.

Refer to Line of business equity on page 39, and page
93 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62
and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of those methodologies.

(a) Primarily includes operating lease income and commissions and other fees. For the three months ended March 31,
2023 and 2022, operating lease income was $741 million and $1.0 billion, respectively. (b) Included depreciation
expense on leased assets of $407 million and $694 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. (c) Included MSR risk management results of $(12) million and $109 million for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (d) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to
CCB associated with a Merchant Services revenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in
Payments in CIB. Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Quarterly results Net income was $5.2 billion, up 80%. Net revenue was $16.5 billion, an increase of 35%. Net
interest income was $12.8 billion, up 54%, driven by: • deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset
by lower average deposits in Banking & Wealth Management (“BWM”), and • higher revolving loans in Card Services,
partially offset by • tighter loan spreads in Home Lending. Noninterest revenue was $3.6 billion, down 6%, driven
by: • lower auto operating lease income as a result of a decline in volume, and • in Home Lending lower production
revenue from a decline in volume and lower net mortgage servicing revenue, reflecting a net loss compared with a
net gain in the prior year in MSR risk management, largely offset by • an increase in card income driven by higher
net interchange largely due to a reduction in rewards costs and partner payments related to a periodic tax refund
on airline miles redeemed, and higher annual fees, partially offset by higher amortization related to new account
origination costs, and • higher travel-related commissions in Card Services. Refer to Note 5 for additional
information on card income, asset management fees, and commissions and other fees. Refer to Note 14 for further
information regarding changes in the value of the MSR asset and related hedges, and mortgage fees and related
income. Noninterest expense was $8.1 billion, up 5%, largely driven by: • higher compensation expense driven by
wage inflation and headcount growth, as well as investments in the business, largely offset by • lower auto lease
depreciation on lower auto lease assets. The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion, and included: • net
charge-offs of $1.1 billion, up $499 million, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting continued
normalization in delinquencies, and • a $350 million net addition to the allowance for credit losses, driven by a
deterioration in the Firm’s weighted-average economic outlook, including $300 million in Card Services and $50
million in Home Lending. The prior year included a $125 million addition to the allowance for credit losses across
CCB. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 48-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65
for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

(a) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, nonaccrual loans
excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and
insured by U.S. government agencies of $164 million
and $315 million, respectively. These amounts have
been excluded based upon the government guarantee. In
addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt
credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual
status as permitted by regulatory guidance. (b) At
March 31, 2023 and 2022, generally excludes loans that
were under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Credit
Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022
Form 10-K for further information on consumer
assistance. (c) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, included
$205 million and $2.9 billion of loans, respectively,
in Business Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not
expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans
because the loans are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to
Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's
2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the PPP.
(d) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, the principal balance
of loans under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic was $353 million and
$728 million in Home Lending, respectively. Loans that
are performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Credit
Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022
Form 10-K for further information on consumer
assistance. (e) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, excluded
mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of
$219 million and $370 million, respectively, that are
30 or more days past due. These amounts have been
excluded based upon the government guarantee. (f) On
January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR
accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance
resulted in a net decrease in the allowance for loan
losses of $591 million, driven by residential real
estate and credit card. Refer to Note 1 for further
information.

Quarterly results Net income was $4.4 billion, up 1%.
Net revenue was $13.6 billion, flat compared to the
prior year. Banking revenue was $4.2 billion, down 1%.
• Investment Banking revenue was $1.6 billion, down
24%, predominantly driven by lower Investment Banking
fees, down 19%, reflecting lower debt underwriting
fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking
fees, according to Dealogic. – D ebt underwriting fees
were $663 million, down 34%, and Equity underwriting
fees were $235 million, down 6%, as challenging market
conditions resulted in lower issuance activity. –
Advisory fees were $756 million, down 6%, compared to
a strong prior year, driven by a lower level of
announced deals. • Payments revenue was $2.4 billion,
up 26% and included a gain on an equity investment in
the prior year. Excluding the net impact of equity
investments, Payments revenue was up 55%, driven by
deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially
offset by lower average deposits. • Lending revenue
was $267 million, down 17%, and included $103 million
of fair value losses on hedges of retained loans.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $9.4 billion, up 1%. Markets revenue was $8.4 billion, down 4%. • Fixed
Income Markets revenue was $5.7 billion, flat compared to the prior year, reflecting: – lower revenue in Currencies
& Emerging Markets compared to a strong prior year, and – higher revenue in Rates with favorable market conditions
early in the quarter and elevated volatility in March 2023, as well as higher revenue in Credit Trading from higher
client flows. • Equity Markets revenue was $2.7 billion, down 12%, driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives
and Cash Equities, compared to a strong first quarter in the prior year. • Securities Services revenue was $1.1
billion, up 7%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially offset by lower average deposits and
lower average market values of assets under custody. • Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $153 million,
driven by losses on certain components of fair value option elected liabilities, compared with a loss of $524
million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $7.5 billion, up 2%, largely driven by higher compensation,
including headcount growth and wage inflation, largely offset by lower revenue-related compensation. The provision
for credit losses was $58 million, predominantly driven by net charge-offs of $50 million. The net addition to the
allowance for credit losses was driven by net downgrade activity and a deterioration in the Firm's weighted-average
economic outlook, largely offset by a reduction in the allowance for client-specific exposures. The prior year
provision was $445 million, driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit losses. Refer to Credit and
Investment Risk Management on pages 48-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for further discussions of
the credit portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 16-17.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets may occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.
Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the primary source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount
recognized upon executing new transactions.

(a) Includes CB’s share of revenue from investment
banking products sold to CB clients through the CIB
which is reported in All other income. (b) Includes
gross revenues earned by the Firm, that are subject to
a revenue sharing arrangement with the CIB, for
products sold to CB clients through the Investment
Banking, Markets or Payments businesses. This includes
revenues related to fixed income and equity markets
products. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 18
for discussion of revenue sharing. Quarterly results
Net income was $1.3 billion, up 58%. Net revenue was
$3.5 billion, up 46%. Net interest income was $2.7
billion, up 78%, driven by deposit margin expansion on
higher rates, partially offset by lower average
deposits. Noninterest revenue was $781 million, down
10%, driven by lower deposit-related fees due to the
higher level of credits earned by clients that reduce
such fees, partially offset by higher investment
banking revenue. Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion,
up 16%, largely driven by higher compensation,
including headcount growth, as well as higher volume-
related expense. The provision for credit losses was
$417 million, reflecting a net addition to the
allowance for credit losses, predominantly driven by a
deterioration in the Firm's weighted-average economic
outlook and net downgrade activity. The provision for
credit losses in the prior year was $157 million,
driven by a net addition to the allowance for credit
losses. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management
on pages 48-66 and Allowance for Credit Losses on
pages 63-65 for further discussions of the credit
portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Quarterly results Net income was $1.4 billion, up 36%. Net revenue was $4.8 billion, up 11%. Net interest income
was $1.5 billion, up 35%. Noninterest revenue was $3.3 billion, up 3%. Revenue from Asset Management was $2.4
billion, up 5%, driven by: • a gain of $339 million on the original minority interest in CIFM upon the Firm's
acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in the entity, partially offset by • lower performance fees, and • lower
management fees reflecting a decline in market levels, predominantly offset by the removal of most money market
fund fee waivers. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.4 billion, up 17%, driven by: • deposit margin expansion
reflecting higher rates on lower average deposit balances, partially offset by • an investment valuation loss, and
• tighter spreads on lower average loans. Noninterest expense was $3.1 billion, up 8%, predominantly driven by
higher compensation due to headcount growth, higher revenue-related compensation and the impact of acquisitions.
The provision for credit losses was $28 million. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 48-66 and
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 63-65 for further discussions of the credit portfolios and the allowance for
credit losses.

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, driven by tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, of $56 million and $58
million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (b) Predominantly relates to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives.

Quarterly results Net income was $244 million, compared with a net loss of $856 million in the prior year. Net
revenue was $985 million, compared with a net loss of $881 million in the prior year, driven by higher net interest
income due to higher rates. Noninterest revenue was a loss of $755 million, compared with a loss of $345 million in
the prior year, driven by: • higher net investment securities losses on sales of U.S. GSE and government agency MBS
and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio, and • the absence of
proceeds from an insurance settlement in the prior year partially offset by • higher net gains on certain legacy
private equity investments, compared with net losses in the prior year. Noninterest expense of $160 million was
down $24 million. The provision for credit losses was $370 million, reflecting an addition to the allowance for
credit losses, including an allowance for credit losses associated with Other assets. Refer to Note 9 for
additional information on the investment securities portfolio, and Note 12 for additional information on the
allowance for credit losses. The change in the current period tax expense was driven by the level and mix of income
and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves. Other
Corporate also reflects the Firm's international consumer growth initiatives, which includes Chase U.K., the Firm's
digital retail bank in the U.K.; Nutmeg, a digital wealth manager in the U.K.; and a 40% ownership stake in C6
Bank, a digital bank in Brazil.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk
governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance framework The
Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and
impacts of risks. Refer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient
level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s
business activities and associated risks during normal
economic environments and under stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar
3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s capital risk.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and
its insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held
by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-
weighted assets ("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted
according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-
based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm
is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s
Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently
more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based
ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
to calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 39 for
additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL regulatory capital transition

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL
capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out
at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of March
31, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the
remaining $1.4 billion benefit associated with the
CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm
phased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition
provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as
applicable.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and
Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and
the CECL accounting guidance.

Risk-based Capital Targets

The Firm’s current target for its Basel III
Standardized CET1 capital ratio is 13.0%, which the
Firm surpassed in both the fourth quarter of 2022 and
the first quarter of 2023. With consideration for an
increase in the global systemically important banks
("GSIB") surcharge in 2024, the Firm has maintained a
target ratio of 13.5% for the first quarter of 2024,
which assumes no change in the Stress Capital Buffer
("SCB"). The Firm’s quarterly capital ratios may vary
from these targets dependent on market conditions.
These targets are based on the Basel III capital rules
currently in effect.

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its contractual and contingent
financial obligations as they arise or that it does
not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor
of funding and liquidity to support its assets and
liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website,
for a further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk.
LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of
eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their
respective estimated total net cash outflows over a
prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant
stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in
excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR
requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank
affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months
ended March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31,
2022 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR
framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.
(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading
assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess eligible
HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. (e) End of period HQLA balances
were $758.9 billion, $735.5 billion, and $735.8 billion for March 31, 2023, December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2022,
respectively. The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with the
three months period ended December 31, 2022, primarily due to a return of funds from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as a
result of a dividend payment to the Parent Company.

The Firm's average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with the prior year period
largely driven by an increase in HQLA from long-term debt issuances. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR
decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with the three months ended December 31, 2022
reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA, primarily due to a reduction in cash associated with a
decline in average deposits, a dividend payment to the Parent Company, and higher average loans. JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2023 decreased when compared with the same period in
the prior year, reflecting a decrease in JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from a
decline in deposits and loan growth, as well as lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities. Refer
to Note 9 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR fluctuates from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA
and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows.
Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing that is intended to ensure that the
Firm and its material legal entities have sufficient liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including
scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios are produced
on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results
of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity
position. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company, the IHC, and operating subsidiaries at levels
sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through
periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted. Other liquidity sources In addition to
the assets reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had unencumbered marketable securities,
such as equity and debt securities, that the Firm believes would be available to raise liquidity. This includes
excess eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The
fair value of these securities was approximately $700 billion and $694 billion as of March 31, 2023 and December
31, 2022, respectively, although the amount of liquidity that could be raised at any particular time would be
dependent on prevailing market conditions.
                                                        42                                                         
The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of
approximately $330 billion and $323 billion as of
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash
and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or
other unencumbered securities that are currently
pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window
and other central banks. Although available, the Firm
does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal
Reserve Banks discount window and the other central
banks as a primary source of liquidity.

The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

As of March 31, 2023, the Firm and JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum NSFR
requirement, based on the Firm's current
interpretation of the final rule. The Firm will be
required to publicly disclose its quarterly average
NSFR semiannually beginning in the second half of
2023.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access
funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-
term

debt, or from borrowings from the Intermediate Holding
Company (“IHC”). The Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are
primarily funded from long-term unsecured borrowings
and short-term secured borrowings which are primarily
securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements.
Excess funding is invested by Treasury and CIO in the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio or deployed in
cash or other short-term liquid investments based on
their interest rate and liquidity risk
characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion
of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and
wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm. Refer to pages
100-101 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for
additional disclosure on the Firm's deposit balances.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are generally more representative of deposit trends than period-end
deposit balances. However, during periods of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits were lower for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the three months ended March 31,
2022. The decrease was predominantly driven by: • declines in CIB and CB due to attrition and in AWM due to
migration into higher-yielding investments as a result of the rising interest rate environment, partially offset by
net issuances of structured notes in CIB, • a decline in CCB from existing accounts primarily due to migration to
higher-yielding investments and increased customer spending, and • an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
ongoing international consumer initiatives. Period-end deposits increased, reflecting inflows in March 2023,
primarily in CCB and CB, as a result of disruptions in the market related to recent bank failures, which changed
the outflow trend that started in the second half of 2022. AWM also experienced deposit inflows in March which were
more than offset by migration to higher-yielding investments by month end. The increase in period-end deposits also
reflected: • net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a result of client demand, and • an increase in Corporate
related to the Firm's ongoing international consumer initiatives. Refer to the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets
Analysis and the Business Segment Results on pages 13-14 and pages 18-34, respectively, for further information on
deposit and liability balance trends. Refer to Note 3 for further information on structured notes.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2023,
compared with December 31, 2022, due to higher secured
financing of trading assets and the impact of a lower
level of netting on client-driven market-making
activities in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds.

The decrease in commercial paper at March 31, 2023
from December 31, 2022, and for the average three
months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the prior year
period, was due to lower net issuance levels resulting
from short-term liquidity management.

The decrease in average unsecured other borrowed funds
for the three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to
the prior year period was due to lower levels of
overdrafts as well as net maturities of structured
notes classified as other borrowed funds in CIB.

Long-term funding and issuance Long-term funding
provides an additional source of stable funding and
liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding
plan is driven primarily by expected client activity,
liquidity considerations, and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include
maintaining diversification, maximizing market access
and optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates
various funding markets, tenors and currencies in
creating its optimal long-term funding plan. The
significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured
funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of the funding needs of both
bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company
advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its
subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to
external counterparties. The following table
summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities
or redemptions for the three months ended March 31,
2023 and 2022. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 97-104 and Note 20 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-
term debt.

  Credit ratings                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk
and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to
liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features
in Note 4 for additional information on the impact of
a credit ratings downgrade on the funding requirements
for VIEs, and on derivatives and collateral
agreements.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
March 31, 2023, were as follows:

  CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                         
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with
the default or change in credit profile of a client,
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a
reduction in expected returns on investments,
including consumer credit risk,

wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit
Portfolio and

Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 50-65 for a
further discussion of Credit Risk.

Refer to page 66 for a further discussion of
Investment Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and
Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s Credit and Investment Risk

  CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                    
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or
customer. In the following tables, total loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-
sale; and certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not include loans which the Firm
accounts for at fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further information
regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 11, 22 and 4 for additional information on the Firm’s loans, lending-related
commitments and derivative receivables. Refer to Note 9 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in
the securities financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 50-53 and Note 11 for further
discussions of the consumer credit environment and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages
54-62 and Note 11 for further discussions of the wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans. On January 1,
2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure
requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves
a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay,
term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as
financial difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a
modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs will differ
from those previously considered TDRs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 11 for further information.

(e) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available
lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines
of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 22 for further
information.

insured by U.S. government agencies of $263 million and $302 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(j) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(k) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded $54 million and $101 million, respectively,

Portfolio analysis Loans were relatively flat compared
to December 31, 2022 driven by higher auto loans and
loans at fair value, predominantly offset by lower
retained residential real estate loans. Residential
real estate: The residential real estate portfolio,
including loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value,
predominantly consists of prime mortgage loans and
home equity lines of credit. Retained loans decreased
compared to December 31, 2022, reflecting paydowns,
net of originations. Net recoveries were lower for the
three months ended March 31, 2023 compared to the same
period in the prior year driven by lower prepayments
due to higher interest rates. Loans at fair value
increased from December 31, 2022, driven by an
increase in Home Lending as originations outpaced
warehouse loan sales, largely offset by lower CIB
loans as sales outpaced purchases. The carrying value
of home equity lines of credit outstanding was $14.9
billion at March 31, 2023. This amount included $4.8
billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only
to fully amortizing payments or have been modified and
$4.8 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which
primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk
of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or
reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by
law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile. At March
31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying value of
interest-only residential mortgage loans was $36.4
billion and $36.3 billion, respectively. These loans
have an interest-only payment period generally
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully
amortizing payment period to maturity and are
typically originated as higher-balance loans to
higher-income borrowers, predominantly in AWM. The
credit performance of this portfolio is comparable
with the performance of the broader prime mortgage
portfolio.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-
value ratio of residential real estate loans Refer to
Note 11 for information on the geographic composition
and current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential
real estate loans. Modified residential real estate
loans For the three months ended March 31, 2023,
residential real estate FDMs were $38 million. In
addition to FDMs, the Firm also had $23 million of
loans subject to trial modification where the terms of
the loans have not been permanently modified, as well
as $2 million of loans subject to discharge under
Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings ("Chapter 7 loans").
The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated
the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment
criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter
7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to
Note 1 and Note 11 for further information. For the
three months ended March 31, 2022, residential real
estate TDRs were $118 million. Refer to Note 11 for
further information on TDRs in prior periods.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value consists of prime-
quality scored auto and business banking loans, as
well as overdrafts. The portfolio increased when
compared to December 31, 2022 due to originations of
scored Auto loans, predominantly offset by paydowns.
Net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31,
2023 increased compared to the same period in the
prior year due to higher scored Auto charge-offs as
delinquency levels increased and vehicle valuations
declined. The scored Auto net charge-off rates were
0.47% and 0.18% for the three months ended March 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively. Nonperforming assets The

Total credit card loans decreased from December 31,
2022 reflecting the impact of seasonality. The March
31, 2023 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 1.68%
and 0.83%, respectively, increased compared to the
December 31, 2022 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of
1.45% and 0.68% as delinquencies continued to
normalize but remained below pre-pandemic levels. Net
charge-offs increased for the three months ended March
31, 2023 compared to the same period in the prior year
reflecting continued normalization in delinquencies.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 11 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

For the three months ended March 31, 2023, credit card
FDMs were $163 million. In addition to FDMs, the Firm
also had $24 million of loans subject to trial
modification where the terms of the loans have not
been permanently modified. The changes to the TDR
accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably
expected and concession assessment criteria.
Accordingly, trial modifications were considered TDRs,
but not FDMs.

For the three months ended March 31, 2022, credit card
TDRs were $82 million.

Refer to Note 1 and Note 11 for further information.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 56-59 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in
CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. For the three
months ended March 31, 2023, credit continued to perform well with charge-offs remaining low. As of March 31, 2023,
the increase in nonperforming exposure was driven by loans, resulting from client-specific downgrades in CIB and
CB, partially offset by a reduction in lending-related commitments. As of March 31, 2023, retained loans increased
$654 million driven by CB, largely offset by a decline in AWM. Lending-related commitments increased $12.6 billion
driven by net portfolio activity in CB and CIB, including an increase in held-for-sale positions in the bridge
financing portfolio in CB.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as
of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2023,
may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

  Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which
consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans
held-for-sale and loans at fair value was $34.4 billion and $31.3 billion at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
representing approximately 3.0% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively. C riticized exposure
increased, driven by client-specific downgrades largely in Real Estate, Consumer and Retail, Industrials, and
Healthcare, partially offset by client-specific upgrades. Of the $34.4 billion of criticized exposure at March 31,
2023, approximately half was undrawn and $31.5 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to
Note 4 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit,
and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity
securities). Because of this collateralization, no
allowance for credit losses is generally held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm
establishes margin requirements and monitors the
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to
which the Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter
("OTC") derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit
risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-
traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and
options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”)
derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the
credit risk of the relevant central counterparty
clearing house (“CCP”). Where possible, the Firm seeks
to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from
derivative contracts through the use of legally
enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral
agreements.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter
derivative transactions subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally
cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 89% and 87% at March 31, 2023, and
December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements and for a further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets was $59.3 billion and
$70.9 billion at March 31, 2023, and December 31,
2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven
by market movements in CIB Markets. Derivative
receivables represent the fair value of the derivative
contracts after giving effect to legally enforceable
master netting agreements and the related cash
collateral held by the Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other
cash collateral that may be used as security when the
fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s
favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid
securities is consistent with the definition of high
quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits
of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount
of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it
is available as security against potential exposure
that could arise should the fair value of the client’s
derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer
to Note 4 for additional information on the Firm’s use
of collateral agreements.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally consists of : •
the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), •
the allowance for lending-related commitments, which
is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities
on the Consolidated balance sheets, and • the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in
the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of
March 31, 2023 was $22.8 billion, reflecting a net
addition of $1.1 billion from December 31, 2022. The
net addition to the allowance for credit losses was
predominantly driven by a deterioration in the Firm's
weighted-average economic outlook, including the
impact from changes to the Firm’s macroeconomic
scenarios, and the additional weight placed on the
relative adverse scenario. The additional weight
placed on the relative adverse scenario reflects an
increased probability of a moderate recession due to
tightening financial conditions, including higher
inflation, changes in monetary policy, and
geopolitical risks. The net addition to the allowance
consisted of: • $726 million in wholesale , which also
reflected net downgrade activity, and an addition to
the allowance for credit losses associated with Other
assets in Corporate, and • $416 million in consumer .
The allowance for credit losses also reflected a
reduction of $587 million as a result of the adoption
of changes to the TDR accounting guidance. Refer to
Note 1 for further information. The Firm's allowance
for credit losses is estimated using a weighted
average of five internally developed macroeconomic
scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more
punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in
a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at
5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a 1.2% lower
U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.

The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

(a) Represents the impact to the allowance for loan losses upon the Firm's adoption of changes to the TDR
accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and
disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow
("DCF") methodology. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF,
portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-
dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to
apply. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably
expected TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") loans.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At March 31,
2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities
portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was
$608.1 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
33-34 and Note 9 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
42-47 for further information on related liquidity
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 67-72
for further information on the market risk inherent in
the portfolio.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve in line with its strategies, including the
Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities
and minority-owned businesses. The table below
presents the aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios as March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
131-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.
                                                                                                                   
  Value-at-risk                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages
136-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can
vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a) Diversification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual
components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and
risk types.

(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio,
which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which
is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the
credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the
widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to
maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effects of nickel price increases and the associated volatility
in the nickel market resulted in elevated average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR. For the three months ended
March 31, 2023, average and maximum Credit Portfolio VaR have decreased driven by a reduction in nickel-related
exposure when compared to the same period in the prior year.

(d) The increase in CCB VaR is driven by interest rate volatility impacting Home Lending warehouse loans, MSR, and
related hedges.

(e) The increase in Corporate and other LOB VaR is driven by higher market values for a legacy private equity
position in Corporate which is publicly traded.

(f) The maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components
and consequently diversification benefit is not meaningful.

Average total VaR decreased by $16 million for the
three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with the
same period in the prior year predominantly due to a
reduction in the nickel-related counterparty exposure
in Credit Portfolio VaR.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR
for the five trailing quarters. The movement in VaR in
March 2022 was driven by changes in nickel-related
counterparty exposure in the Firm's Credit Portfolio.

  VaR backtesting                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five
times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended March 31, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 259 days, and observed 16
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 44 of
the 64 days, and observed two VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended March 31, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities but also from the Firm’s traditional
banking activities, which include extension of loans
and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt
and the investment securities portfolio. One way that
the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk
estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a
given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a
sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest
income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The
baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of
deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts
simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in
U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar”
currencies). These simulations primarily include
retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks,
investment securities, long-term debt and any related
interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of
other positions in risk management VaR and other
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 132 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-risk
scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both
short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and
holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term
rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These
scenarios consider many different factors, including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates. •
Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in
the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects
certain assumptions relating to the reversal of
Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and
require management judgment. Therefore, the actual
amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular
time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve
may take as part of monetary policy, including through
the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In
addition, there are other factors that impact the
amount of deposits held at the Firm such

as the level of loans across the industry and
competition for deposits. • The pricing sensitivity of
deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount
by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given
change in market interest rates. The deposit rates
paid in these scenarios differ from actual deposit
rates paid, due to repricing lags and other factors.
The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors. The Firm is currently
evaluating the modeling of repricing lags for deposits
in its earnings-at-risk scenarios. Incorporating
repricing lags, in the current environment, would
significantly affect the U.S. dollar interest rate
scenarios, with higher interest rate scenarios
expected to result in a positive sensitivity, and
lower interest rate scenarios expected to result in a
negative sensitivity, on the Firm’s earnings-at-risk.
While a relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate
exposure, the earnings-at-risk analysis does not
represent a forecast of the Firm’s net interest
income. Refer to Outlook on page 8 for additional
information. The Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are
presented in the table below.

sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points parallel and
short-term shift in rates is primarily the result of a
greater impact from liabilities repricing compared to

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate
scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with
long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis
points and short-term rates staying at current levels
were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 . In addition to
earnings-at-risk, the Firm also measures Economic
Value Sensitivity (EVS). EVS stress tests the longer-
term economic value of equity by measuring the
sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet,
primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and
investment securities as well as related hedges, under
various interest rate scenarios. In accordance with
the CTC structural interest rate risk policy, the Firm
has established limits on EVS as a percentage of CET1.

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31, 2023 and December 31,

(a) Excludes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured under the measurement
alternative. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of
CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit
spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency.
This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.

(e) Impact recognized through OCI.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 139-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table
presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2023 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2022. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the
Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period
to period due to client activity and market flows. The increase in exposure to Germany was predominantly driven by
increases in cash placed with the central bank of Germany and in debt securities, due to client-driven market-
making activities. The decrease in exposure to Australia was predominantly driven by a reduction in cash placed
with the central bank of Australia due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in interest rates. The
Firm continues to monitor potential impacts to the Firm associated with the war in Ukraine. As of March 31, 2023,
exposure to Russia was approximately $500 million. This amount excludes certain deposits placed on behalf of
clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally consists of:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated).

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, which
is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities
on the Consolidated balance sheets, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities, which is reflected in investment
securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and
refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 63-65
and Note 12 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses
being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty

variables. The specific variables that have the
greatest effect on the modeled losses of each
portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional
U.S. unemployment and HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.
interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices,
commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 63 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher

over the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak
difference of

2.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023; lower

U.S. real GDP with a slower recovery, remaining
approximately 3.0% lower at the end of the eight-
quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 3.3% in the first quarter of 2024; and
lower national HPI with a peak difference of
approximately 9.3% in the fourth quarter of 2024.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including:

• The allowance as of March 31, 2023, reflects credit
losses beyond those estimated under the central
scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse
scenarios.

• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this
analysis
                                                        74                                                         
cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe changes
in macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of future
changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior
can significantly affect the allowance for credit
losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss
estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of March 31,
2023, the Firm compared the modeled estimates under
its relative adverse scenario to its central scenario.
Without considering offsetting or correlated effects
in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses, the comparison between
these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect
the following differences: • An increase of
approximately $650 million for residential real estate
loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of
approximately $2.5 billion for credit card loans • An
increase of approximately $3.9 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments This analysis
relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall
allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the
quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the
modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and
conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of
macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain,
particularly in light of the recent economic
conditions, the Firm believes that its process to
consider the available information and associated
risks and uncertainties is appropriately governed and
that its estimates of expected credit losses were
reasonable and appropriate for the period ended March
31, 2023.

Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including derivatives,
structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
including certain mortgage, home equity and other
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at
fair value The following table includes the Firm’s
assets measured at fair value and the portion of such
assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative
receivables total reflects the impact of netting
adjustments; however, the $10.7 billion of derivative
receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to
a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to
the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would
be reduced if netting were applied, including the
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments
used to estimate fair value are more significant than
those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speed, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
                              
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there
is no assurance that any list of risks and
uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to
differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and
political conditions and geopolitical events,
including the war in Ukraine;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting
the Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to
address those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and
scrutiny of JPMorgan Chase’s business practices,
including dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies and
laws;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Changes in FDIC assessments;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including
changes in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending
or savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its
capital and liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or
its subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,
environmental and sustainability concerns that may
arise, including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an
economic slowdown or other economic or market
disruption, including, but not limited to, in the
interest rate environment;

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its
counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
require the Firm to incur liabilities or absorb losses
not contemplated at their initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified
and diverse employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,
customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of
certain assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate
change or extraordinary events beyond the Firm's
control, and the Firm’s ability to deal effectively
with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational
systems or those of third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself
against cyberattacks and other attempts by
unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm
or its customers or to disrupt the Firm’s systems; and

• The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part
I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and
JPMorgan Chase does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements. The reader should,
however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial
transaction processing and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business
segments. The accounting and financial reporting policies of JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by
regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP
require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities,
revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results could be different
from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal, recurring adjustments have been included such that
this interim financial information is fairly stated. These unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements, and related notes thereto, included in
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in prior periods have been revised to conform with the
current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase
and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial interest. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not
assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it
has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest
entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S.
GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and derivative payables with the same counterparty and the
related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also permits securities financing activities to be presented
on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including the existence of a legally enforceable master netting
agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it has determined that the specified conditions are met.
Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on offsetting assets and liabilities.
Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method
The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the
portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also be included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size
of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged. This guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that
can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet presentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting
adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designate those
securities in a portfolio layer method hedge upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained
earnings was not material. Refer to Note 4 and Note 9 for additional information. Financial Instruments – Credit
Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures The adoption of this guidance eliminated the
accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a
discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified
loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must
be the post-modification effective interest rate, instead of the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm
elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all
portfolios except modified nonaccrual risk-rated loans which the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF
methodology. Refer to Note 12 for a description of the portfolio-based allowance approach and the asset-specific
allowance approach.
                                                        84                                                         
This guidance was adopted under the modified
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease
to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587million and
an increase to retained earnings of $ 446million,
after-tax predominantly driven by residential real
estate and credit card. The adoption of this guidance
eliminated the disclosure requirements for TDRs
including the requirement to assess whether a
modification is reasonably expected or involves a
concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for
loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness,
interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant
payment delay, term extension or a combination of
these modifications. The Firm has defined these types
of modifications as financial difficulty modifications
("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the
requirement to assess whether a modification is
reasonably expected or involves a concession, the
population of loans considered FDMs will differ from
those previously considered TDRs. This guidance also
requires disclosure of current period gross charge-
offs by vintage origination year. Refer to Note 11 for
further information.

(a) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 78.9billion and $
73.8billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge
accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities
inventories have been included in each period presented.
                                                        88                                                         
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2023, and
December 31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds,
real estate and other funds, were $ 976million and $ 950million, respectively. Included in these balances at March
31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $ 40million and $ 43million, respectively, and other assets
of $ 936million and $ 907million, respectively.

(e) At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, included $ 10.2billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, of residential
first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.4billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien mortgages.
Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S. GSEs and
government agencies of $ 3.6billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 732million, nonagency securities of $ 5million and
non-trading loans of $ 958million.

(c) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 25million, nonagency securities of $ 10million,
trading loans of $ 72million and non-trading loans of $ 325million.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 854million and non-trading loans of $ 196million.

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 796million including $ 215million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

unobservable inputs as well as a description of
attributes of the underlying instruments and external
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in
the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in
level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes
in fair value) for financial instruments classified by
the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.
When a determination is made to classify a financial
instrument within level 3, the determination is based
on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the
overall fair value measurement. However, level 3
financial instruments typically include, in addition
to the unobservable or level 3 components, observable
components (that is, components that are actively
quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below
include changes in fair value due in part to
observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the
observable components of level 3 financial instruments
using securities and derivative positions that are
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk
management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect
the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities
related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3
assets since December 31, 2022, for those items
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis on page 95 for further information
on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis. Three months ended March 31, 2023
Level 3 assets were $ 23.8billion at March 31, 2023,
relatively flat compared to December 31, 2022, with no
individually significant movements. Refer to the
sections below for additional information. Transfers
between levels for instruments carried at fair value
on a recurring basis For the three months ended March
31, 2023, there were no significant transfers from
level 2 into level 3. For the three months ended March
31, 2023, significant transfers from level 3 into
level 2 included the following: • $ 953million of
gross equity derivative receivables as a result of an
increase in observability and a decrease in the
significance of unobservable inputs. For the three
months ended March 31, 2022, significant transfers
from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $
1.2billion of total debt and equity instruments,
largely due to equity securities of $ 853million
driven by a decrease in observability as a result of
restricted access to certain markets. For the three
months ended March 31, 2022, there were no significant
transfers from level 3 into level 2. All transfers are
based on changes in the observability and/or
significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed
to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting
period in which they occur. Gains and losses The
following describes significant components of total
realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments
measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the
periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects
of the Firm’s risk management activities where the
financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2
of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level
3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables
on pages 91-94 for further information on these
instruments.

Three months ended March 31, 2023 • $ 891million of
net gains on assets, driven by gains in net derivative
receivables due to market movements. • $ 1.5billion of
net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by an
increase in the fair value of long-term debt due to
market movements. Three months ended March 31, 2022 •
$ 2.0billion of net gains on assets, predominantly
driven by gains in net equity derivative receivables
due to market movements and MSRs reflecting lower
prepayment speeds on higher rates. • $ 2.2billion of
net gains on liabilities, largely driven by gains in
long-term debt due to market movements. Refer to Note
14 for information on MSRs.

Credit and funding adjustments — derivatives

The following table provides the impact of credit and
funding adjustments on principal transactions revenue
in the respective periods, excluding the effect of any

observable price changes in orderly transactions from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer
(measurement alternative). Of the $ 179million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as
of March 31, 2023, $ 158million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These
equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions
on the shares.
(b) Of the $ 833million in level 3 assets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of March 31, 2023, $
14million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral
(e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information
from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 13% to 48% with a weighted average of 25%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2022 was $ 4.1billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative
purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.
(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2023 were $ 1.5billion.
(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2023 were $(
1.0) billion.
Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 37million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa
B shares”). These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common
shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters
involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B shares into Visa A shares was 1.5991at March 31, 2023, and the
conversion rate may be adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of
those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is
unknown. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer
restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares will be.
As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not considered to
be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.

In connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the
purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate.
Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent
changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The
payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer
restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology
based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The
derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other
income. As of March 31, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23million Visa B shares that the
Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by
law, without notice. Refer to page 169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation
of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities,
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and
loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair
value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in
the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.
(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.
(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2023, and December 31,
2022.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair
value option was elected was $ 9.4billion and $ 7.6billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $
12million and $ 24million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page
111 for more information on volumes and types of
credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        103                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-
related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared
derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings
downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at March 31, 2023,
and December 31, 2022.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2023, and December
31, 2022, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features
that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which
additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The
liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating
agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 10, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at both March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied
to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 14.6billion and $ 26.0billion at March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31,
2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 19.9billion and $ 20.3billion,
respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 217million and $ 221million, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the
Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a
portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. At March 31, 2023, the amortized cost
of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 38.9billion, of which $ 24.5billion was designated as hedged.
The cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $ 21million. Refer to Note 1 and Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will
reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three months ended March 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item
in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net
interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31,
2023 and 2022.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.4) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in
AOCI at March 31, 2023, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized
in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses
The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge
accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in
fair value of these amounts directly in other income.
(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. During the

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified
risk management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not
designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are
used to manage risks associated with certain specified
assets and liabilities, including certain risks
arising from mortgage commitments, warehouse loans,
MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign
currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives
used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in
mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as
well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in
mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate
credit risk associated with lending exposures in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not
include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative
receivables, which is included in gains and losses on
derivatives related to market-making activities and
other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate
foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses
were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents Other protection purchased by CIB, primarily in its market-making businesses.
(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.
(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.
(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of protection.
The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings
profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The
ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection are
comparable to the profile reflected below.

(a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities hedged in a closed
portfolio. Under U.S. GAAP portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual securities,
however the amounts impact the unrealized gains or losses for the individual securities being hedged. Refer to Note
1 and Note 4 for additional information.
(b) The Firm purchased $ 3.6billion and $ 13.2billion of HTM securities for the three months ended March 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively.
(c) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $ 90million and $
96million at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.
(d) Excludes $ 2.4billion and $ 2.5billion of accrued interest receivable at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion of
accounting policies for accrued interest receivable on investment securities.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 7.4billion and $ 9.6billion, at March 31, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in
interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by
the U.S. government.

HTM securities – credit risk Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM
securities is the risk rating assigned to each
security. At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, all
HTM securities were rated investment grade and were
current and accruing, with approximately 99% and 98%
rated at least AA+, respectively.

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities was $ 90million and $ 41million as of March
31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which included a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings
related to the transfer of HTM securities to AFS for
the period ended March 31, 2023. Refer to Note 10 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further discussion
of accounting policies for AFS and HTM securities.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio
hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal
prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield
is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for
credit losses of $( 29) million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $ 21million at March
31, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $( 61)
million at March 31, 2023.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately seven yearsfor agency residential MBS, and six yearsfor both agency residential
collateralized mortgage obligations and nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which
the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and
collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the
Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. When the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant
netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”
presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-
for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities
within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, the Firm held $ 871million and $ 692million, respectively, of financial
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a
sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions.
The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded
predominantly in short-term borrowings on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and
Vintage Disclosures accounting guidance as discussed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the
existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure requirements for
FDMs. The disclosure requirements for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Refer
to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on loan modifications prior to January 1,
2023, which were accounted for and reported as TDRs. This new guidance also requires disclosure of current period
gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were
not material at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022

(b) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent.

(c) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not
material at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee.

(d) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2023,
approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at March
31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 45million for both the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at March 31, 2023.

(k) Prior-period amount has been revised to conform with the current presentation.

Loan modifications The Firm grants certain
modifications of residential real estate loans to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which
effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The
Firm's proprietary modification programs as well as
government programs, including U.S. GSE programs,
generally provide various modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty including, but not
limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions,
other-than-insignificant payment delay and principal
forgiveness that would otherwise have been required
under the terms of the original agreement, are
considered FDMs. For the three months ended March 31,
2023, residential real estate FDMs were $ 38million.
The financial effects of the FDMs, which were largely
in the form of term extensions and interest rate
reductions, included extending the weighted-average
life of the loans up to 24years, and reducing the
weighted-average contractual interest rate from 5.84%
to 3.57%. There were noadditional commitments to lend
to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose
loans have been modified as FDMs. In addition to FDMs,
the Firm also had $ 23million of loans subject to a
trial modification, and $ 2million of Chapter 7 loans.
The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated
the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment
criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter
7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. For
periods ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications
of residential real estate loans where the Firm
granted concessions to borrowers who were experiencing
financial difficulty were generally accounted for and
reported as TDRs. For the three months ended March 31,
2022, new TDRs were $ 118million. There were no
additional commitments to lend to borrowers whose
residential real estate loans have been modified in
TDRs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form
10-K for further information on TDRs.

(a) Represents concessions granted in permanent modifications as a percentage of the number of loans permanently
modified. The sum of the percentages exceeds 100% because predominantly all of the modifications include more than
one type of concession. Concessions offered on trial modifications are generally consistent with those granted on
permanent modifications.
(b) Includes variable interest rate to fixed interest
rate modifications and payment delays that meet the
definition of a TDR. Financial effects of

(a) At March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
nonaccrual loans excluded $ 54million and $
101million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days
past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $
53million and $ 76million, respectively, were no
longer accruing interest based on the guidelines set
by the SBA. Typically the principal balance of the
loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a
specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting the
guidelines set by the SBA. There were noloans that
were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more
days past due and still accruing interest at March 31,
2023 and December 31, 2022.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an
allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,
certain nonaccrual loans that are considered
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their
underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value
of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to
charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on
a cash basis was not material for the three months
ended March 31, 2023 and 2022 .

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are
ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding
loan balances at March 31, 2023.

Loan modifications The Firm grants certain
modifications of auto and other loans to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty, which effective
January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. For the three
months ended March 31, 2023, auto and other FDMs were
not material and there were noadditional commitments
to lend to borrowers modified as FDMs. For the three
months ended March 31, 2022, auto and other TDRs were
not material.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which
effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card under
long-term programs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan
continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In
most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.
The following table provides information on credit card loan modifications considered FDMs.

For the period ended March 31, 2023, the Firm also had
$ 24million of loans subject to a trial modification.
The changes to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated
the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment
criteria. A ccordingly, trial modifications are not
considered FDMs.

For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses
twoconsecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. For periods ending prior to
January 1, 2023, modifications of credit card loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were
experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on TDRs.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients,
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

Internal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans. The following tables

(a) When the discounted cash flows or collateral value equals or exceeds the amortized cost of the loan, the loan
does not require an allowance. This typically occurs when the loans have been partially charged off and/or there
have been interest payments received and applied to the loan balance.
(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended
March 31, 2023 and 2022.

(a) Represents FDMs that were 30 days or more past due
at March 31, 2023.
As of March 31, 2023, additional commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose
Commercial and industrial loans have been modified as FDMs were $ 909million. FDMs to borrowers in the Other loan
class were $ 63million for the three months ended March 31, 2023. The financial effect of FDMs extended the loans
by a weighted-average of four monthsand were generally in the form of term extensions. There were noadditional
commitments to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs. For the three
months ended March 31, 2023, Secured by real estate FDMs were notmaterial and there were noadditional commitments
to lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs.

Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. F or the three months ended March 31,
2022, n ew TDRs were $ 418million and reflected the extension of maturity dates, covenant waivers, receipt of
assets in partial satisfaction of the loan and deferral of principal and interest payments, predominantly in the
Commercial and Industrial and Other loan classes. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the impact of these
modifications were not material to the Firm. As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a
modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs is greater
than those previously considered TDRs.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. On January
1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments -
Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting
guidance as described in Note 1. The adoption of this
guidance eliminated the requirement to measure the
allowance for TDRs using a DCF methodology and allowed
the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for
modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied for
these modified loans, the discount rate must be the
post-modification effective interest rate, instead of
the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm
elected to change from an asset-specific allowance
approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance
approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for
all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and
nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-
specific allowance approach will continue to apply.
This guidance was adopted under the modified
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease
to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587million and
an increase to retained earnings of $ 446million,
after-tax predominantly driven by residential real
estate and credit card. Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of
the allowance for credit losses and the related
accounting policies.

allowance for credit losses of $ 241million associated with Other assets in Corporate and $ 20million associated
with certain accounts receivable in CIB.
(c) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably
expected TDRs and modified PCD loans.
(d) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(e) At March 31, 2023 and 2022, lending-related commitments excluded $ 16.0billion and $ 15.3billion, respectively,
for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 861.2billion and $ 757.3billion, respectively, for the
credit card portfolio segment; and $ 17.5billion and $ 32.9billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio
segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

Discussion of changes in the allowance

The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2023 was $ 22.8billion, reflecting a net addition of $ 1.1billion
from December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses was predominantly driven by a
deterioration in the Firm's weighted-average economic outlook, including the impact from changes to the Firm’s
macroeconomic scenarios, and the additional weight placed on the relative adverse scenario. The additional weight
placed on the relative adverse scenario reflects an increased probability of a moderate recession due to tightening
financial conditions, including higher inflation, changes in monetary policy, and geopolitical risks. The net
addition to the allowance consisted of: • $ 726million in wholesale , which also reflected net downgrade activity,
and an addition to the allowance for credit losses associated with Other assets in Corporate, and • $ 416million in
consumer . The allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction of $ 587million as a result of the adoption
of changes to the TDR accounting guidance. Refer to Note 1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit
losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse
scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table
below, resulting in a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.8% in the third quarter of 2024, and a
1.2% lower U.S. real GDP exiting the second quarter of 2024.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-
sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act
as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        140                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests.

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of
business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests
in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 10.4billion and
$ 13.8billion of the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31,
2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively, which have
been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.
Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated
under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide
liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide
lending-related commitments to certain clients of the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded
commitments were $ 9.8billion and $ 10.6billion at
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively,
and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments in other unfunded commitments to extend
credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal
bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option
bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance
their municipal bond investments at short-term rates.
TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and
non-customer TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are
sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor
for all non-customer TOB transactions.

(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.
(b) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified in the line
item on the Consolidated balance sheets titled, “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of
these beneficial interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in
beneficial interests in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 1.1billion and $ 2.1billion at March 31,
2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or
custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does
not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate
the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would
record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds
investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and
operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party
is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated
to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $
30.2billion at both March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, of which $ 10.7billion and $ 10.6billion was unfunded at
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss,
may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note
25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax credits and Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
                                                        143                                                        
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $ 5.9billion
and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022
was $ 8.4billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized and sold a variety
of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to

Ginnie Mae guidelines

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or
guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying
these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated
to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and
Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to
the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due
to material breaches of representations and warranties
as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option
to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S.
government agencies under certain arrangements. The
Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans
from Ginnie Mae loan

pools as it continues to service them and/or manage
the foreclosure process in accordance with the
applicable requirements, and such loans continue to be
insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase
option becomes exercisable, such loans must be
reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan
with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 11 for
additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s

Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
year, or more often if events or circumstances, such
as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate
that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.
Unanticipated declines in business performance,
increases in credit losses, increases in capital
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of
equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the
Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which
could result in a material impairment charge to
earnings in a future period related to some portion of
the associated goodwill. As of March 31, 2023, the
Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated
market cost of equity, as well as actual business
results and projections of business performance. Based
on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill
was not impaired as of March 31, 2023, or December 31,
2022, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment
during the three months ended March 31, 2023 or 2022.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022.

(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result
of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.
(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g.,
cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
March 31, 2023, and December 31, 2022, and outlines
hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to
immediate adverse changes in those assumptions, as
defined below.

Firm as lessee

At March 31, 2023, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries
were obligated under a number of noncancellable
leases, predominantly operating leases for premises
and equipment used primarily for business purposes.

Operating lease liabilities and right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets are recognized at the lease commencement date
based on the present value of the future minimum lease
payments over the lease term.
The following table provides information related to
the Firm’s operating leases:

The Firm’s net rental expense was $ 487million and $
495million for the three months ended March 31, 2023
and 2022, respectively.

Firm as lessor

The Firm’s lease financings are predominantly auto
operating leases, and are included in other assets on
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
The following table presents the Firm’s operating
lease income, included within other income, and the
related depreciation expense, included within
technology, communications and equipment expense, on

Note 21 – Regulatory capital

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes
similar minimum capital requirements and standards for
the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI
subsidiaries are also subject to these capital
requirements established by their respective primary
regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios
to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were
subject as of March 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

CECL regulatory capital transition

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL
capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out
at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of March
31, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected the
remaining $ 1.4billion benefit associated with the
CECL capital transition provisions.

Additionally, effective January 1, 2023, the Firm
phased out 50% of the other CECL capital transition
provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as
applicable.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on CECL capital transition
provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31,
2023, and December 31, 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored
business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has
not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper
facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well
as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose
facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant
Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card
transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the
Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge
back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will
bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding
future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes
a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.
                                                        158                                                        
Loan sales and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold
meet certain requirements, and that may require the
Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the
loan purchaser if such representations and warranties
are breached by the Firm. The liability related to
repurchase demands associated with private label
securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in
establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for additional information regarding
litigation. Sponsored member repo program The Firm
acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements
through the Government Securities Division of the
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf
of clients that become sponsored members under the
FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the
prompt and full payment and performance of its
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under
the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability
under these guarantees by obtaining a security
interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing
house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to
be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure,
without taking into consideration the associated
collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing
house guarantees and commitments line on page 157.
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for additional information on credit risk mitigation
practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.
Guarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has
guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes
of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase
Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank on a parity with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 157 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional
information.

central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.

Contingencies

As of March 31, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous legal
proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement matters. The
litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially
millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal
proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at
varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and
several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory
antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm
believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for
its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.2billion at March 31, 2023. This estimated aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the
Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not
believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of
multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous
yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of
many of the claims, and • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where
the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition,
the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate
because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the
aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary
significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P.
Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia
Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was
served in August 2022. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to
payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an
account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company between 1MDB and
PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the Firm filed an application challenging the validity of
service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. In April 2023, 1MDB discontinued its claim
against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA, but requested permission of the Court to refile in the future, which the Court
took under consideration. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India
Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by
JPMorgan Chase entities into residential housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017,
numerous creditors filed civil claims against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to
delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the
Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private
Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the
Supreme Court of India issued an order making preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including
unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain
currency control and money laundering provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s
Prevention of Money Laundering Act (“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED
attached approximately $ 25million from J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA
investigation. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the PMLA investigation. Foreign Exchange
Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government authorities
relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those activities.
Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely
on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)
                                                        160                                                        
through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related
governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South
Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class
action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an
alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted
in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court
to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. The District
Court denied certification of a putative class action against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf
of certain parties who purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates and granted summary judgment
against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. Those plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. In addition, some FX-
related individual and putative class actions based on similar alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside
the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the
UK actions was reached in December 2022. In a putative class action pending before the U.K. Competition Appeal
Tribunal, proposed class representatives have appealed the tribunal's denial of a request for class certification
on an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which
remains subject to court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a
series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the
price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012,
the parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded
to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The original class action was divided
into twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief.
In September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the
prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $
900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December
2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. In March 2023, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s approval of the settlement, and two merchants have
filed petitions for rehearing of the Appellate Court’s approval. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted
out of the amended class settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in
accordance with the settlement agreement. The injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021,
the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of
the merchants who opted out of the amended damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions
raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of
those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing
approximately 65% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein
Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is named as a defendant in twolawsuits filed in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York which allege that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated
Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013.
One case, which was filed in November 2022, is a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim
of Epstein, and the other case, which was filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the
United States Virgin Islands and also alleges certain Virgin Islands statutory claims. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
moved to dismiss both complaints. In March 2023, the Court granted in part and denied in part JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.’s motions to dismiss, allowing some claims to proceed in both lawsuits. Also in March 2023, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm’s former employee, James Edward Staley, into the
twolawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification, contribution, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of the
faithless servant doctrine. In April 2023, Staley moved to dismiss the complaints. Also in April 2023, the putative
class action plaintiff filed a motion for class certification seeking to represent a class of alleged sex-
trafficking victims of Epstein. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. intends to oppose both motions. LIBOR and Other Benchmark
Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to inquiries from various governmental agencies
and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank
Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate
(“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other
bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European Commission issued a decision against the Firm and
other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal
of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal is pending.
                                                        161                                                        
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain
other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps
sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action related to the period
that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed. In addition, a group of
individual plaintiffs filed a lawsuit asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were
engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based
consumer loans and credit cards. In September 2022, the Court dismissed plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety, and
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting similar antitrust claims, which defendants have moved to dismiss.
The Firm’s settlements of putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore
Swap Offer Rate, and the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022,
while the settlement related to Swiss franc LIBOR remains subject to court approval. Securities Lending Antitrust
Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan
Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and
New York State common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange
trading for securities lending transactions. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint was denied. Plaintiffs
have moved to certify a class in this action, which defendants have opposed. Shareholder Litigation . Several
shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the
Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former officers.
Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious
metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the
DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a resolution
between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed
in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment
claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the
subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this
action in full, and in January 2023, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal, which remains pending. A second
shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York in
December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary
duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused from making a demand to commence
litigation because such a demand would have been futile. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is
pending in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who
acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings
of the Firm were materially false or misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the
historical trading practices and conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. A
separate shareholder derivative suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of New York asserting breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the
alleged failure of the Board of Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records
preservation requirements which were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the
SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. * * * In addition to the various
legal proceedings discussed above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise
involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the
claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself
vigorously. Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established
reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of
U.S. GAAP for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a
liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its
outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such
reserves, upward or downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel.
The Firm’s legal expense was $ 176million and $ 119million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. There is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future.
In view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants
seek very large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters
                                                        162                                                        
present novel legal theories, involve a large number
of parties or are in early stages of discovery, the
Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the
eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters,
the timing of their ultimate resolution or the
eventual losses, fines, penalties or consequences
related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes,
based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the
material legal proceedings described above and after
taking into account its current litigation reserves
and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses,
that the other legal proceedings currently pending
against it should not have a material adverse effect
on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The
Firm notes, however, that in light of the
uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is
no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these
matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it
has currently accrued or that a matter will not have
material reputational consequences. As a result, the
outcome of a particular matter may be material to
JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular
period, depending on, among other factors, the size of
the loss or liability imposed and the level of
JPMorgan Chase’s income for that period.

  Note 25 – Business segments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three months ended March 31,
2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP
results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and
tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed
basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At
least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a
result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to Line of business equity on page 93 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services
revenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

On May 1, 2023, the Firm acquired the substantial
majority of assets and assumed the deposits and
certain other liabilities of First Republic Bank from
the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In carrying
out this transaction, the Firm expects to further
advance the Firm’s wealth management strategy and
complement its existing franchises. The Firm is
estimating the impact of the acquisition on its
financial statements and expects these estimates to be
further refined during the purchase accounting
measurement period. The Firm has concluded that, due
to the limited amount of time since the date of this
transaction, in accordance with the accounting
guidance, it is impracticable to provide all of the
disclosures required for a business combination at the
time of this filing.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:
                                                                                                                   
  Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements                                                                
                                                                                                                   
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of March 31, 2023, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2023 and
2022, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “interim financial statements”).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the accompanying
interim financial statements for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein),
and in our report dated February 21, 2023, which
included a paragraph describing a change in the manner
of accounting for credit losses on certain financial
instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In
our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as
of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the consolidated
balance sheet from which it has been derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

or investment is originated or acquired, adjusted for
accretion or amortization of premium, discount, and
net deferred fees or costs, collection of cash,
charge-offs, foreign exchange, and fair value hedge
accounting adjustments. For AFS securities, amortized
cost is also reduced by any impairment losses

collateral-dependent when repayment of the loan is
expected to be provided substantially through the
operation or sale of the collateral when the borrower
is experiencing financial difficulty, including when
foreclosure is deemed probable based on borrower
delinquency.

Commercial Card: provides a wide range of payment
services to corporate and public sector clients
worldwide through the commercial card products.
Services include procurement, corporate travel and
entertainment, expense management services, and

Credit derivatives : Financial instruments whose value
is derived from the credit risk associated with the
debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity)
which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to
transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference
between the face value of the CDS contract and the
fair value at the time of settling the credit
derivative contract. The determination as to whether a
credit event has occurred is generally made by the
relevant International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

Eligible LTD: Long-term debt satisfying certain
eligibility criteria

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

the appraised value of the collateral (i.e.,
residential real estate) securing the loan.
                                                                                                                   
  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.

An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.
                                                                                                                   
  Combined LTV ratio

positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest
                                                        170                                                        
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the
loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast,
which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully
amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance
and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards
programs generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate
for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and

interest has been in default for a period of 90 days
or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in
the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans
are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant

discipline through disclosure requirements which allow
market participants to assess the risk and capital
profiles of banks.

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in client-
driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven
market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities
(including physical commodities inventories and
financial instruments that reference commodities).
Principal transactions revenue also includes certain
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to
hedge accounting and specified risk-management
activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a

Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual fund rating services
rank funds based on their risk-adjusted performance
over various periods. A 5-star rating is the best
rating and represents the top 10% of industry-wide
ranked funds. A 4-star rating represents the next
22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 3-star rating
represents the next 35% of industry-wide ranked funds.
A 2-star rating represents the next 22.5% of industry-
wide ranked funds. A 1-star rating is the worst rating
and represents the bottom 10% of industry-wide ranked
funds. An overall Morningstar rating is derived from a
weighted average of the performance associated with a
fund’s three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable)
Morningstar Rating metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds,
separate star ratings are provided at the individual
share class level. The Nomura “star rating” is based
on three-year risk-adjusted performance only. Funds
with fewer than three years of history are not rated
and hence excluded from these rankings. All ratings,
the assigned peer
                                                        175                                                        
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star
rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The
performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of mutual fund assets under management in
funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd quartile (one, three,
and five years): All quartile rankings, the assigned
peer categories and the asset values used to derive
these rankings are sourced from the fund rating
providers. Quartile rankings are based on the net-of-
fee absolute return of each fund. Where applicable,
the fund rating providers redenominate asset values
into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on
fund performance and associated peer rankings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, at a
“primary share class” level to represent the quartile
ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong Kong funds and
at the fund level for all other funds. The performance
data may have been different if all share classes had
been included. Past performance is not indicative of
future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.
