2022, unless otherwise specified.
                                                                                                                   
  Firmwide overview                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
For the third quarter of 2023, JPMorgan Chase reported
net income of $13.2 billion, up 35%, earnings per
share of $4.33, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 22%. The
Firm's results for the third quarter of 2023 included
investment securities losses of $669 million in
Treasury and CIO, and legal expense of $665 million,
predominantly in CIB.

• Total net revenue was $39.9 billion, up 22%,
reflecting:

– Net interest income ("NII") of $22.7 billion, up
30%, driven by higher rates, the impact of First
Republic and higher revolving balances in Card
Services, partially offset by lower average deposit
balances and lower

Markets net interest income. NII excluding Markets was
$23.2 billion, up 37%.

– Noninterest revenue ("NIR") was $17.1 billion, up
13%, driven by higher Markets noninterest revenue, the
impact of First Republic, higher asset management fees
and lower net investment securities losses in Treasury
and CIO, partially offset by impairment losses on
equity investments in CIB.

– Total Markets revenue declined reflecting lower
Markets NII, predominantly offset by higher NIR.

• Noninterest expense was $21.8 billion, up 13%,
predominantly driven by the impact of First Republic,
higher compensation expense, including growth in front
office and technology headcount as well as wage
inflation, and higher legal expense.
                                                         5                                                         
• The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion,
reflecting $1.5 billion of net charge-offs and a net
reduction in the allowance for credit losses of $113
million. The net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses reflected:

– $184 million in wholesale , predominantly driven by
the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related
commitment portfolios in CIB, partially offset by the
net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic
scenarios,

partially offset by

– a net addition of $58 million in consumer ,
primarily driven by CCB, comprised of $301 million in
Card Services, predominantly offset by a $250 million
net reduction in Home Lending.

Net charge-offs increased $770 million, predominantly
driven by CCB, primarily Card Services.

The prior year included an $808 million net addition
to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs
of $727 million.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $24.2
billion at September 30, 2023. The Firm had an
allowance for loan losses to retained loans coverage
ratio of 1.73%, compared with 1.70% in the prior year.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $8.1 billion
at September 30, 2023, up 12%, driven by wholesale
nonaccrual loans, which reflects the impact of
downgrades. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and
Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 70-79 and pages
65-69, respectively, for additional information.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 17%,
predominantly driven by higher loans in CCB and CB,
primarily as a result of First Republic.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were down
4%, driven by :

– continued migration in AWM into higher-yielding
investments; a net decline in CCB reflecting higher
customer spending in existing accounts; and continued
deposit attrition in CB,

partially offset by

– increases in CCB associated with First Republic, in
Corporate related to the Firm's international consumer
initiatives, and in CIB due to net issuances of
structured notes as a result of client demand.

and Advanced CET1 ratios were 14.3% and 14.5%,
respectively.

• SLR was 6.0%.

• TBVPS grew 17%, ending the third quarter of 2023 at
$82.04.

• As of September 30, 2023, the Firm had eligible end-
of-period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of
approximately $796 billion and unencumbered marketable
securities with a fair value of approximately $590
billion, resulting in approximately $1.4 trillion of
liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management

These current expectations are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorgan Chase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form
10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on
page 95 of this Form 10-Q; Part I, Item 1A, Risk
Factors on pages 9-32 of the 2022 Form 10-K; and Part
II, Item 1A, Risk Factors on page 209 of this Form
10-Q for a further discussion of certain of those
risks and uncertainties and the other factors that
could cause JPMorgan Chase’s actual results to differ
materially because of those risks and uncertainties.
There is no assurance that actual results in 2023 will
be in line with the outlook information set forth
below, and the Firm does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements.

JPMorgan Chase’s current outlook for full-year 2023
should be viewed against the backdrop of the global
and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the
geopolitical environment, the competitive environment,
client and customer activity levels, and regulatory
and legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The
Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates.

In May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking recommending a special assessment related
to the systemic risk determination made on March 12,
2023, to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund
("DIF") arising from the protection of uninsured
depositors resulting from recent bank resolutions. In
its current form, the rule would impose a special
assessment at an annual rate of 12.5 basis points on
certain banks’ estimated uninsured deposits reported
as of December 31, 2022. If this rule remains as
proposed, the Firm expects to recognize an estimated
assessment expense of approximately $3 billion (pre-
tax) when the rule is finalized.

• Management expects net interest income to be
approximately $88.5 billion and net interest income
excluding Markets to be approximately $89 billion,
market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be
approximately $84 billion, market dependent and
excluding any FDIC special assessment.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card
Services to be approximately 2.5%.

Net interest income excl uding Markets and adjusted
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank
(the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver.

JPMorgan Chase’s Consolidated Financial Statements as
of and for the period ended September 30, 2023 reflect
the impact of First Republic. Where meaningful to the
disclosure, the impact of the First Republic
acquisition, as well as subsequent related business
and activities, are disclosed in various sections of
this Form 10-Q. The Firm continues to convert certain
operations, and to integrate clients, products and
services, associated with the First Republic
acquisition to align with the Firm’s businesses and
operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to
which segments certain clients, products and services,
primarily deposits, should be allocated. Accordingly,
reporting classifications and allocations may change
in future periods, including across the Firm's
segments.

Refer to Note 28 and page 23 for additional
information related to First Republic.

discussion of material risk factors that could affect
the Firm. These risk factors include potential impacts
to the Firm associated with current market and
economic conditions, including inflationary pressures,
higher interest rates and ongoing geopolitical
tensions and hostilities, any or all of which could
result in additional market disruption, government
actions (including with respect to monetary policies),
continuing impacts to global supply chains, and other
geopolitical risks.

Investment banking fees in CIB included :

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by higher
issuance activity in high-yield bonds and higher
originations in leveraged loans reflecting wallet
share gains, partially offset by lower issuance
activity in high-grade bonds impacted by higher rates,
and

• lower advisory fees due to a lower number of
completed transactions, reflecting the lower level of
announced deals in prior periods amid a challenging
environment.

Refer to Business Segment Results and CIB segment
results on pages 21-46 and pages 29-35, respectively,
and Note 6 for additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting
in CIB:

• higher principal transactions revenue in Equity
Markets, primarily in Equity Derivatives and Prime
Finance. The higher principal transactions revenue in
Equities was more than offset by lower Equity Markets
net interest income, primarily due to higher funding
costs, and

• in Fixed Income Markets, principal transactions
revenue was relatively flat, primarily due to lower
revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets,
offset by higher revenue in Securitized Products and
Fixed Income Financing.

The increase in principal transactions revenue also
included the impact of higher short-term cash
deployment activities in Treasury and CIO as a result
of the current interest rate environment.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has
offsets across other revenue lines, including net
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of
its Markets business on a total net revenue basi s.

Refer to CIB and Corporate segment results on pages
29-35 and pages 45-46, respectively, and Note 6 for

Lending- and deposit-related fees incr eased due to:

• higher lending-related revenue driven by the
amortization of the fair value discount on certain
acquired lending-related commitments associated with
First Republic, predominantly in AWM and CB,

partially offset by

• lower cash management fees in CIB and CB driven by
the higher level of credits earned by clients that
reduce such fees.

Refer to CIB, CB and AWM segment results on pages
29-35, pages 36-39 and pages 40-44, respectively, and

inflows and higher average market levels in AWM and
CCB, and the impact of First Republic in CCB.

Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 24-28
and pages 40-44, respectively, and Note 6 for
additional information; and Business Segment Results
on page 23 for additional information on First

Commissions and other fees increased largely driven by
higher commissions on brokerage activities and higher
administration fees.

Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 29-35
and pages 40-44, respectively, and Note 6 for
additional information.

Investment securities losses reflected lower net
losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, associated with repositioning
the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and
CIO. R efer to Corporate segment results on pages
45-46 and Note 10 for additional information.

Mortgage fees and related income increased in Home
Lending, reflecting the impact of First Republic,
higher production revenue, and higher net mortgage
servicing revenue .

Refer to CCB segment results on pages 24-28 and Notes
6 and 15 for additional information.

Card income increased in CIB and CB, reflecting growth
in merchant processing volume in J.P. Morgan Payments
.

Card income increased in CCB, reflecting higher net
interchange from the impact of an increase in debit
and credit card sales volume, and higher annual fees,
predominantly offset by higher amortization related to
new account origination costs.

Refer to Business Segment Results, CCB, CIB and CB
segment results on pages 21-46, pages 24-28, pages
29-35 and pages 36-39, respectively, Critical
Accounting Estimates on pages 91-93, and Note 6 for
additional information.

Other income decre ased, reflecting:

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a
decline in volume, and

• the net impact of equity investments in CIB,
including impairment losses in the current period,

largely offset by

• measurement period adjustments of $100 million
resulting in an increase to the estimated bargain
purchase gain associated with the First Republic
acquisition.

Refer to Business Segment Results on page 23 and Note
28 for additional information on the First Republic
acquisition; and Note 5 for additional information on
net investment hedges.

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates,
the impact of First Republic, and higher revolving
balances in Card Services , partially offset by lower
average deposit balances and lower Markets net
interest income.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3
trillion, down $13 billion, and the yield was 5.32%,
up 227 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these
assets, on an FTE basis, was 2.72%, an increase of 63
bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.89%, up 108
bps.

Refer to the Consolidated average balance sheets,
interest and rates schedule on page 198 for further

Investment banking fees decreased, reflecting in CIB:

• lower debt underwriting fees as challenging market
conditions, primarily in the first half of the year,
resulted in lower issuance activity across leveraged
loans, high-grade bonds and investment-grade loans.
This was partially offset by higher issuance activity
in high-yield bonds driven by higher industry-wide
issuance, and

• lower advisory fees due to a lower number of
completed transactions, reflecting the lower level of
announced deals in prior periods amid a challenging
environment.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting
in CIB:

• higher Equity Markets net revenue in principal
transactions, primarily in Prime Finance and Equity
Derivatives,

• higher Fixed Income Markets net revenue in principal
transactions, primarily in Securitized Products and
Fixed Income Financing, largely offset by lower
revenue in Rates and Currencies & Emerging Markets,

– the increase in Markets principal transactions
revenue was more than offset by a decline in Markets
net interest income, primarily due to higher funding
costs

• losses of $178 million in Credit Adjustments &
Other, largely driven by losses on certain components
of fair value option elected liabilities, compared
with losses of $773 million in the prior year.

The increase in principal transactions revenue also
included the impact of higher short-term cash
deployment activities in Treasury and CIO as a result
of the current interest rate environment .

Lending- and deposit-related fees was relatively flat,
reflecting :

• higher lending-related revenue driven by the
amortization of the fair value discount on certain
acquired lending-related commitments associated with
First Republic, predominantly in AWM and CB,

predominantly offset by

• lower cash management fees in CIB and CB driven by
the higher level of credits earned by clients that

Asset management fees in creased driven by the impact
of First Republic, higher average market levels and
strong net inflows in CCB, and in AWM strong net
inflows as well as the removal of most money market
fund fee waivers.

Commissions and other fees increased driven by higher
commissions on travel-related services and annuity
sales in CCB.

Investment securities losses reflected higher net
losses on sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, associated with repositioning
the investment securities portfolio in both periods in
Treasury and CIO.

Mortgage fees and related income decreased in Home
Lending, reflecting:

• lower production revenue due to a decline in volume,
and

• lower net mortgage servicing revenue due to lower
net gains in MSR risk management and lower operating
revenue.

Card income increased in CIB and CB, reflecting growth
in merchant processing volume and Commercial Card
transactions in J.P. Morgan Payments .

Card income increased in CCB, reflecting

• higher net interchange from the impact of an
increase in debit and credit card sales volume, and a
reduction in rewards costs and partner payments in the
first quarter of 2023 related to a periodic tax refund
on airline miles redeemed, largely offset by an
increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments
to certain reward program terms in the second quarter
of 2023, and

• lower other card income driven by higher
amortization related to new account origination costs,
predominantly offset by higher annual fees.

Other income in creased, reflecting:

• the $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain
associated with the First Republic acquisition in
Corporate,

• the impact of net investment hedges, primarily in
the first half of 2023, in Treasury and CIO, and

• a gain of $339 million recognized in the first
quarter of 2023 in AWM on the original minority
interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the
remaining 51% interest in the entity,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income in CCB due to a
decline in volume,

• the net impact of equity investments in CIB,
including impairment losses in the third quarter of
2023,

• the absence of proceeds from an insurance settlement
in the prior year,

• the absence of a gain in the prior year on an
equity-method investment received in partial
satisfaction of a loan in CB, and

• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate
investments .

Net interest income increased driven by higher rates,
higher revolving balances in Card Services, and the
impact of First Republic, partially offset by lower
Markets net interest income and lower average deposit
balances.

The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.3
trillion, down $80 billion, and the yield was 5.01%,
up 263 bps. The net yield on these assets, on an FTE
basis, was 2.66%, an increase of 81 bps. The net yield
excluding Markets was 3.84%, up 150 bps.

The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion,
reflecting $1.5 billion of net charge-offs and a $113
million net reduction in the allowance for credit
losses.

Net charge-offs increased $770 million, predominantly
driven by Card Services in CCB, as the portfolio
continues to normalize to pre-pandemic levels.

The net reduction in the allowance for credit losses
of $113 million consisted of:

• $184 million in wholesale , predominantly driven by
the impact of changes in the loan and lending-related
commitment portfolios in CIB, partially offset by the
net effect of changes in the Firm's macroeconomic
scenarios,

partially offset by

• a net addition of $58 million in consumer ,
primarily driven by CCB, comprised of $301 million in
Card Services, predominantly offset by a $250 million
net reduction in Home Lending. The net addition in
Card Services was driven by loan growth, including an
increase in revolving balances, largely offset by
changes in the Firm's macroeconomic outlook including
a lower forecasted unemployment rate, and reduced
borrower uncertainty. The net reduction in Home
Lending was driven by improvements in the outlook for
home prices.

The prior year included an $808 million net addition
to the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs
of $727 million.

The provision for credit losses was $6.6 billion,
reflecting $4.0 billion of net charge-offs and a $2.5
billion net addition to the allowance for credit
losses.

Net charge-offs increased $2.1 billion, primarily
driven by Card Services in CCB, as the portfolio
continues to normalize to pre-pandemic levels.

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses
consisted of:

• $707 million in consumer , predominantly driven by
CCB, comprised of $801 million in Card Services,
partially offset by a $200 million net reduction in
Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was
driven by loan growth, including an increase in
revolving balances, partially offset by reduced
borrower uncertainty and the net effect of changes in
the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook. The
net reduction in Home Lending was largely driven by
improvements in the outlook for home prices, and

• $616 million in wholesale , driven by net downgrade
activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm's
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including
deterioration in the outlook for commercial real
estate in CB, partially offset by the impact of
changes in the loan and lending-related commitment
portfolios in CIB in the third quarter of 2023.

The net addition also included $1.2 billion to
establish the allowance for the First Republic loans
and lending-related commitments in the second quarter
of 2023.

The prior year included a $2.1 billion net addition to
the allowance for credit losses and net charge-offs of
$2.0 billion.

2, 2023. Refer to Business Segment Results on page 23 for additional information.
                                                                                                                   
   Quarterly results                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
Compensation expense increased driven by:

• additional headcount, primarily in front office and
technology, as well as the impact of wage inflation,
and

• the impact of First Republic, largely in CCB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of :

• the impact of First Republic in CCB and Corporate,

• higher legal expense, predominantly in CIB,

• higher investments in the businesses, including
technology and marketing, and

• higher other expense, including higher indirect tax
expense in CIB and the increase in the FDIC assessment
that was announced in October 2022,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense on lower Auto lease
assets.

Compensation expense increased driven by:

• additional headcount, primarily in front office and
technology, as well as the impact of wage inflation,

• the impact of First Republic in the third quarter of
2023, largely in CCB, and

• higher revenue-related compensation in AWM and CCB,
partially offset by a decline in CIB.

Noncompensation expense increased as a result of :

• the impact of First Republic in Corporate and CCB,

• higher investments in the business, including
marketing and technology,

• higher legal expense, predominantly in CIB and
Corporate, and

• higher other expense, including the increase in the
FDIC assessment that was announced in October 2022,
higher indirect tax expense in CIB, and higher travel
and entertainment expense across the segments,

partially offset by

• lower depreciation expense on lower Auto lease
assets.

The effective tax rate increased predominantly driven
by lower benefits associated with tax audit
settlements and changes in the level and mix of income
and expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and
local taxes.

The effective tax rate increased driven by:

• the higher level of pre-tax income and changes in
the mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal
and state and local taxes and lower benefits
associated with tax audit settlements and vesting of
employee stock based awards,

partially offset by

• the impact of the income tax expense associated with
the First Republic acquisition that was reflected in
the estimated bargain purchase gain, which resulted in
a reduction in the Firm’s effective tax rate.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased primarily as a result of First Republic,
which included the impact of the repayment of deposits
provided to First Republic Bank in March 2023 by the
consortium of large U.S. banks and amounts paid to the
FDIC, as well as loan growth. Deposits with banks
reflect the Firm’s placement of its excess cash with
various central banks, including the Federal Reserve
Banks.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements increased driven by Markets,
reflecting higher demand for securities to cover short
positions and higher collateral requirements,
partially offset by a decrease in client-driven
market-making activities, net of the lower level of
netting.

Refer to Note 11 for additional information on
securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities borrowed .

Trading assets increased predominantly driven by CIB
due to higher levels of debt and equity instruments in
Markets, in response to demand from client-driven
market-making activities, and when compared with the
seasonally lower levels at year-end. The increase was
also attributable to the impact of higher short-term
cash deployment activities in Treasury and CIO as a
result of the current interest rate environment. Refer
to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Investment securities decreased due to:

• lower available-for-sale ("AFS") securities driven
by maturities and paydowns, partially offset by net
purchases, the impact of First Republic, and the
transfer of securities from held-to-maturity (“HTM”)
in the first quarter of 2023, and

• lower HTM securities driven by maturities and
paydowns, and the transfer of securities to AFS.

Refer to Corporate segment results on pages 45-46,

Investment Portfolio Risk Management on page 83, and
Notes 2 and 10 for additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting :

• $147 billion of loans associated with First
Republic, primarily reflected in CCB, CB and AWM.

The increase also included:

• growth in new accounts and revolving balances in
Card Services, as the portfolio continues to normalize
to pre-pandemic levels,

• higher revolver utilization and originations in CB,
and

• growth in Auto loans.

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting:

• a net addition to the allowance for loan losses of
$1.7 billion, c onsisting of:

– $1.0 billion in wholesale, driven by net downgrade
activity and the net effect of changes in the Firm's
weighted average macroeconomic outlook, including
deterioration in the outlook for commercial real
estate in CB, partially offset by the impact of
changes in the loan portfolio in CIB in the third
quarter of 2023, and

– $725 million in consumer , predominantly driven by
CCB, comprised of $801 million in Card Services,
partially offset by a $200 million net reduction in
Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was
driven by loan growth, including an increase in
revolving balances, partially offset by reduced
borrower uncertainty and the net effect of changes in
the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook. The
net reduction in Home Lending was largely driven by
improvements in the outlook for home prices, and

• $1.1 billion to establish the allowance for the
First Republic loans in the second quarter of 2023 .

The allowance for loan losses also reflected a
reduction of
                                                        16                                                         
$587 million, on January 1, 2023, as a result of the
adoption of the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses:
Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting guidance.
References in this Form 10-Q to "changes to the TDR
accounting guidance" pertain to the Firm's adoption of
this guidance.

There was also a $308 million net reduction in the
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized
in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 62-83, and Notes 2, 3, 12 and 13 for additional
information on loans and the total allowance for
credit losses; and Business Segment Results on page 23
and Note 28 for additional information on the First
Republic acquisition.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased as
a result of receivables associated with U.S.
Treasuries that matured in Treasury and CIO, and
higher receivables related

to unsettled trades, predominantly offset by lower
client receivables related to client-driven activities
in Markets.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets increased
predominantly due to:

• the other intangibles and goodwill related to the
Firm's acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in
CIFM,

• core deposit intangibles associated with the First
Republic acquisition, and

• higher MSRs as a result of net additions primarily
from purchases, and the impact of higher interest
rates, partially offset by the realization of expected
cash flows.

Refer to Note 15 and 28 for additional information.

Other assets decreased reflecting the impact of the
change in the type of collateral placed with central
counterparties ("CCPs") from cash to securities.

Deposits increased, reflecting:

• net issuances of structured notes in CIB as a result
of client demand, as well as deposit inflows related
to client-driven activities in Securities Services and
Payments,

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives,

• a net increase in CCB due to $64 billion of deposits
associated with First Republic, predominantly offset
by a net reduction reflecting higher customer spending
in existing accounts,

• a net decrease in AWM from continued migration into
higher-yielding investments as a result of the rising
interest rate environment, partially offset by growth
from new and existing customers resulting from new
offerings, and

• continued deposit attrition in CB driven by higher
rates and seasonal outflows, partially offset by the
retention of inflows associated with disruptions in
the market in the first quarter of 2023.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements in creased due to higher
secured financing of trading assets and the impact of
a lower level of netting on client-driven market-
making activities in Markets.

additional information on deposits, federal funds
purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings ;
Notes 2 and 16 for deposits and Note 11 for federal
funds purchased and securities loaned or

sold under repurchase agreements; Business Segment
Results on page 23 and Note 28 for additional
information on the First Republic acquisition.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven
market-making activities in Fixed Income Markets,
which resulted in higher levels of short positions in
debt instruments, partially offset by lower derivative
payables primarily as a result of market movements.
Refer to Notes 2 and 5 for additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities decreased
primarily due to lower client payables related to
client-driven activities in Markets.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
increased in CIB primarily driven by higher levels of
Firm-administered multi-seller conduit commercial
paper held by third parties, reflecting changes in the
Firm’s short-term liquidity management. Refer to
Liquidity Risk Management on pages 54-61 and Notes 14
and 24 for add itional information, specifically Firm-
sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt increased, reflecting the impact of
First Republic, which included the Purchase Money Note
issued to the FDIC, as well as FHLB advances,
partially offset by maturities and redemptions in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management
on pages 54-61; and Note 28 for additional information
on the First Republic acquisition.

Operating activities • In 2023, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and lower accounts payable and other
liabilities, partially offset by lower other assets and higher trading liabilities. • In 2022, cash provided
reflected higher accounts payable and other liabilities, trading liabilities, and net proceeds from loans held-for-
sale, predominantly offset by higher trading assets. Investing activities • In 2023, cash used resulted from higher
securities purchased under resale agreements, higher net loan originations, and net cash used in the First Republic
acquisition, predominantly offset by proceeds from paydowns and maturities of investment securities and from sales
and securitizations of loans held-for-investment. • In 2022, cash used resulted from net loan originations and
higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds of investment securities.

Financing activities • In 2023, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements and higher beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs, largely offset by net outflows in deposits,
which included the impact of the repayment of the deposits provided to First Republic Bank by the consortium of
large U.S. banks that the Firm assumed as part of the First Republic acquisition. • In 2022, cash provided
reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term
borrowings, largely offset by lower deposits. • For both periods, cash was used for repurchases of common stock and
cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 16-18,

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 96-100.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis);

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS;

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense; and

• Allowance for loan losses to period-end loans
retained, excluding trade finance and conduits.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use Of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Key Performance
Measures on pages 58-60 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for a further discussion of management’s use of
non-GAAP financial measures.

  BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  
                            
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are four
major reportable business segments – Consumer &
Community Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank,
Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In
addition, there is a Corporate segment.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is currently evaluated by the
Firm’s Operating Committee. Segment results are
presented on a managed basis. Refer to Explanation and
Reconciliation of the Firm’s use of Non-GAAP Financial
Measures on pages 19-20 for a definition of managed
basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the business segments are intended to
present each segment as if it were a stand-alone
business. The management reporting process that
derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and further refinements may be
implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses
the level of capital required for each LOB on at least
an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various
business metrics which are utilized by the Firm and
its investors and analysts in assessing performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments join efforts to sell products
and services to the Firm’s clients and customers, the
participating business segments may agree to share
revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related
product or service, with allocations to the other
segment(s) involved in the transaction. The segment
results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and
CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate risk and liquidity risk characteristics
of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet
products. Periodically the methodology and assumptions
utilized in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect
economic conditions and other factors, which may
impact the allocation of net interest income to the
segments.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these
risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management
on pages 84-89 for additional information.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each business
segment is referred to as equity. At least annually,
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs may change. Refer to
Line of business equity on page 51, and page 93 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional
information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment Results – Description of
business segment reporting methodology on pages 61-62
and Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a

(a) Primarily includes operating lease income and commissions and other fees. For the three months ended September
30, 2023 and 2022, operating lease income was $685 million and $854 million, respectively, and $2.1 billion and
$2.8 billion for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(b) Included depreciation expense on leased assets of $458 million and $605 million for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $1.3 billion and $2.0 billion for the nine months ended September
30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(c) Included MSR risk management results of $111 million and $54 million for the three months ended September 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively, and $124 million and $191 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and
2022, respectively.

Quarterly results

Net income was $5.9 billion, up 36%.

Net revenue was $18.4 billion, up 29%.

Net interest income was $14.4 billion, up 36%, driven
by:

• deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially
offset by lower average deposits in Banking & Wealth
Management ("BWM"), and

• higher NII driven by increased revolving balances in
Card Services, as well as the impact of First Republic
in Home Lending.

Noninterest revenue was $4.0 billion, up 7%, driven
by:

• the impact of First Republic in BWM, largely asset
management fees, and

• higher mortgage fees and related income in Home
Lending,

partially offset by

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of
adecline in volume.

Card income was up 2%, reflecting higher net
interchange from the impact of an increase in debit
and credit card sales volume, and higher annual fees,
predominantly offset by higher amortization related to
new account origination costs.

Refer to Note 6 for additional information on card
income, asset management fees, and commissions and
other fees; and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages
91-93 for card income.

Refer to Note 15 for further information regarding
changes in the value of the MSR asset and related
hedges, and mortgage fees and related income.

Refer to Note 28 for additional information on the
First Republic acquisition.

Noninterest expense was $9.1 billion, up 14%,
reflecting:

• higher compensation expense, predominantly driven by
an increase in headcount and wage inflation, including
the impact of First Republic, and

• higher noncompensation expense, largely driven by
the impact of First Republic including technology
spend and the amortization of intangibles. The
increase in noncompensation expense also reflects
additional investments in technology and marketing, as
well as the FDIC assessment increase announced in the
prior year, largely offset by lower auto lease
depreciation on lower auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was $1.4 billion,
reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $1.4 billion, up $720 million,
predominantly driven by Card Services, as the
portfolio continues to normalize to pre-pandemic
levels, and

• a $47 million net addition to the allowance for
credit losses driven by $301 million in Card Services,
predominantly offset by a $250 million net reduction
in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was
driven by loan growth, including an increase in
revolving balances, largely offset by changes in the
Firm's

macroeconomic outlook including a lower forecasted
unemployment rate and reduced borrower uncertainty.
The net reduction in Home Lending was driven by
improvements in the outlook for home prices.

The prior year included a $150 million reduction in
the allowance for credit losses across CCB.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 62-83 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
80-82 for a further discussion of the credit
portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Year-to-date results

Net income was $16.4 billion, up 59%.

Net revenue was $52.1 billion, up 33%.

Net interest income was $40.9 billion, up 48%, driven
by:

• deposit margin expansion on higher rates, partially
offset by lower average deposits and the impact of
lower PPP loan forgiveness in BWM, and

• higher NII driven by increased revolving balances in
Card Services, as well as the impact of First Republic
in Home Lending.

Noninterest revenue was $11.1 billion, down 2%, driven
by:

• lower auto operating lease income as a result of a
decline in volume, and

• in Home Lending, lower production revenue from a
decline in volume and lower net mortgage servicing
revenue driven by lower net gains on MSR risk
management and lower operating revenue,

largely offset by

• the impact of First Republic in BWM, largely asset
management fees, and

• higher travel-related commissions in Card Services.

Card income was up 4%, reflecting

• higher net interchange from the impact of an
increase in debit and credit card sales volume, and a
reduction in rewards costs and partner payments in the
first quarter of 2023 related to a periodic tax refund
on airline miles redeemed, largely offset by an
increase to the rewards liability due to adjustments
to certain reward program terms in the second quarter
of 2023, and

• lower other card income driven by higher
amortization related to new account origination costs,
predominantly offset by higher annual fees.

Noninterest expense was $25.5 billion, up 9%,
reflecting:

• higher compensation expense, driven by an increase
in headcount and wage inflation, including the impact
of First Republic in the third quarter of 2023, and
higher revenue-related compensation, and

• higher noncompensation expense, driven by the impact
of First Republic, investments in marketing and
technology, as well as the FDIC assessment increase
announced in the prior year, largely offset by lower
auto lease depreciation on lower auto lease assets.

The provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion,
reflecting:

• net charge-offs of $3.7 billion, up $1.9 billion,
predominantly driven by Card Services, as the
portfolio continues to normalize to pre-pandemic
levels, and

• a $1.0 billion net addition to the allowance for
credit losses, which included $801 million in Card
Services, partially offset by a $200 million net
reduction in Home Lending. The net addition in Card
Services was driven by loan growth, including an
increase in revolving balances, partially offset by
reduced borrower uncertainty, and the net effect of
changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic
outlook, including the updates to the

central scenario in the third quarter of 2023 and the
impact of additional weight placed on the adverse
scenarios in the first quarter of 2023. The net
reduction in Home Lending was largely driven by
improvements in the outlook for home prices.

The net addition also included $408 million to
establish the allowance for the First Republic loans
and lending-related commitments in the second quarter
of 2023.

The prior year included a $125 million addition to the
allowance for credit losses across CCB.

(a) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $123 million and $219 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being
placed on nonaccrual status as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(b) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, generally excludes loans that were under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on consumer assistance.

(c) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, included $129 million and $791 million of loans, respectively, in Business
Banking under the PPP. The Firm does not expect to realize material credit losses on PPP loans because the loans
are guaranteed by the SBA. Refer to Credit Portfolio on pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of the PPP.

(d) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, the principal balance of loans under payment deferral programs offered in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic was $89 million and $454 million in Home Lending, respectively. Loans that are
performing according to their modified terms are generally not considered delinquent. Refer to Credit Portfolio on
pages 108-109 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on consumer assistance.

(e) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, excluded mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies of $175 million and
$284 million, respectively, that are 30 or more days past due. These amounts have been excluded based upon the
government guarantee.

(f) At September 30, 2023, included $396 million allowance associated with First Republic.

(g) On January 1, 2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance. The adoption of this guidance
resulted in a net decrease in the allowance for loan losses of $591 million, driven by residential real estate and
credit card. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

Quarterly results

Net income was $3.1 billion, down 12%.

Net revenue was $11.7 billion, down 2%.

Banking revenue was $4.0 billion, down 2%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $1.6 billion, down
6%. Investment Banking fees were down 3%, driven by
lower advisory fees, largely offset by higher debt
underwriting fees. The Firm ranked #1 for Global
Investment Banking fees, according to Dealogic.

– Advisory fees were $767 million, down 10%, due to a
lower number of completed transactions, reflecting the
lower level of announced deals in prior periods amid a
challenging environment.

– D ebt underwriting fees were $676 million, up 8%,
driven by higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds
and higher originations in leveraged loans reflecting
wallet share gains, partially offset by lower issuance
activity in high-grade bonds impacted by higher rates.

– Equity underwriting fees were $274 million, down 6%,
reflecting lower activity in private placements.

• Payments revenue was $2.1 billion, up 3%. Excluding
the net impact of equity investments, which reflected
an impairment in the current period, revenue was up
12%, driven by deposit margin expansion on higher
rates, partially offset by lower average deposits.

• Lending revenue was $291 million, down 10%, and
included $79 million of fair value losses on hedges of
retained loans.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $7.7
billion, down 2%. Markets revenue was $6.6 billion,
down 3%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $4.5 billion, up
1%, driven by an increase in finance and trading
activity in Securitized Products as well as improved
performance in Credit, predominantly offset by lower
revenues in Currencies & Emerging Markets.

• Equity Markets revenue was $2.1 billion, down 10%,
driven by lower revenues across products when compared
with a stronger performance in the third quarter in
the prior year.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.2 billion, up 9%,
driven by deposit margin expansion on higher rates,
partially offset by lower avera ge deposits.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $61
million, compared with a loss of $31 million in the
prior year.

Noninterest expense was $7.4 billion, up 11%,
predominantly driven by higher legal expense and
higher compensation expense, primarily due to wage
inflation.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$185 million, reflecting a $230 million net reduction
in the allowance for credit losses, driven by the
impact of changes in the loan and lending-related
commitment portfolios and changes in the central
scenario. Net charge-offs were $45 million.

The prior year provision was $513 million, p
redominantly driven by an addition to the allowance
for credit losses.

• Investment Banking revenue was $4.7 billion, down
9%. Excluding $257 million of markdowns on held-for-
sale positions, primarily unfunded commitments, in the
bridge financing portfolio recorded in the second
quarter of 2022, Investment Banking revenue was down
13%. Investment Banking fees were down 10%, driven by
lower debt underwriting and advisory fees. The Firm
ranked #1 for Global Investment Banking fees,
according to Dealogic.

– Debt underwriting fees were $2.0 billion, down 14%,
as challenging market conditions, primarily in the
first half of the year, resulted in lower issuance
activity across leveraged loans, high-grade bonds and
investment-grade loans. This was partially offset by
higher issuance activity in high-yield bonds driven by
higher industry-wide issuance.

– Advisory fees were $2.1 billion, down 11%, due to a
lower number of completed transactions, reflecting the
lower level of announced deals in prior periods amid a
challenging environment.

– Equity underwriting fees were $827 million, up 5%,
driven by higher follow-on offerings due to lower
equity market volatility and higher convertible
securities offerings which benefited from higher
rates, largely offset by lower activity in private
placements amid a challenging environment.

• Payments revenue was $6.9 billion, up 27%. Excluding
the net impact of equity investments, which reflected
an impairment in the third quarter of 2023, revenue
was up 31%, driven by deposit margin expansion on
higher rates, partially offset by lower average
deposits.

• Lending revenue was $857 million, down 19%, driven
by $262 million of fair value losses on hedges of
retained loans, compared to $86 million of gains in
the prior year, partially offset by higher net
interest income.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $25.4
billion, down 2%. Markets revenue was $22.0 billion,
down 6%.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $14.8 billion, down
1%, reflecting lower revenue in Currencies & Emerging

revenue in the Securitized Products Group, Credit
Trading and Rates.

driven by lower revenue in Equity Derivatives and Cash
Equities.

(a) Allowance for loan losses of $182 million and $111 million were held against these nonaccrual loans at
September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(b) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured
by U.S. government agencies of $65 million and $143 million, respectively. These amounts have been excluded based
upon the government guarantee.

(c) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were excluded when calculating the net charge-off/(recovery) rate.

(d) Management uses allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, a
non-GAAP financial measure, to provide a more meaningful assessment of CIB’s allowance coverage ratio. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 19-20.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets may occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives that are

reflected at fair value in principal transactions
revenue. Refer to Notes 6 and 7 for a description of
the composition of these income statement line items.
Refer to Markets revenue on page 70 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information.

For the periods presented below, the primary source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount
recognized upon executing new transactions.

Net income was $1.9 billion, up 105%.

Net revenue was $4.0 billion, up 32%. Net interest
income was $3.1 billion, up 38%, predominantly driven
by deposit margin expansion on higher rates and higher
average loans, largely First Republic, partially
offset by lower average deposits.

Noninterest revenue was $972 million, up 16%, driven
by:

• higher lending-related revenue predominantly driven
by the amortization of the fair value discount on
certain acquired lending-related commitments
associated with First Republic, and

• higher card income,

partially offset by

• lower deposit-related fees due to the higher level
of credits earned by clients that reduce such fees.

Noninterest expense was $1.4 billion, up 17%, driven
by higher compensation expense, reflecting an increase
in headcount including front office and technology
investments, as well as higher volume-related expense,
including the impact of new client acquisitions.

The provision for credit losses was $90 million,
reflecting net charge-offs of $53 million and a net
addition of $37 million to the allowance for credit
losses, driven by updates to certain commercial real
estate pricing variables, largely offset by other
changes in the central scenario and the impact of
changes in the loan and lending-related commitment
portfolios.

The prior year provision was $618 million, reflecting
a net addition to the allowance for credit losses.

Refer to Note 6 for additional information on lending-
related fees.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 62-83 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
80-82 for further discussions of the credit portfolios
and the allowance for credit losses.

reflecting a $1.4 billion net addition to the
allowance for credit losses, largely driven by the net
effect of changes in the Firm's weighted-average
macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the

downgrade activity.

The net addition also included $608 million to
establish the allowance for the First Republic loans
and lending-related commitments in the second quarter

Net income was $1.4 billion, up 16%.

Net revenue was $5.0 billion, up 10%. Net interest
income was $1.6 billion, up 11%. Noninterest revenue
was $3.4 billion, up 10%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.2 billion, down
2%, driven by:

• lower performance fees,

• lower NII due to higher funding costs, and

• net investment valuation losses,

predominantly offset by

• higher asset management fees reflecting strong net
inflows.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $2.8 billion, up
22%, predominantly driven by:

• higher net interest income on higher average loans
and higher lending-related revenue driven by the
amortization

of the fair value discount on certain acquired
lending-related commitments associated with First
Republic ,

partially offset by

• lower net interest income from deposits driven by
lower average balances, largely offset by margin
expansion.

Noninterest expense was $3.1 billion, up 4%, driven by
the impact from the acquisitions of J.P. Morgan Asset
Management China and Global Shares, the impact of
First Republic and continued growth in private banking
advisor teams.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of
$13 million.

The prior year provision was a net benefit of $102
million, predominantly driven by a net reduction in
the allowance for credit losses.

income was $4.6 billion, up 24%. Noninterest revenue
was $10.1 billion, up 7%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $6.7 billion, up 1%,
driven by:

• a gain of $339 million on the original minority
interest in CIFM upon the Firm's acquisition of the
remaining 51% interest in the entity, and

• higher asset management fees reflecting strong net
inflows and the removal of most money market fund fee
waivers in the prior year, largely offset by lower
market levels,

predominantly offset by

• lower performance fees,

• lower NII due to higher funding costs, and

• net investment valuation losses.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $8.0 billion, up
23%, driven by:

• higher net interest income from deposits driven by
margin expansion reflecting higher rates on lower
average balances, and

• higher lending-related revenue predominantly driven
by the amortization of the fair value discount on
certain acquired lending-related commitments
associated with First Republic.

Noninterest expense was $9.4 billion, up 7%,
predominantly driven by continued growth in private
banking advisor teams, the impact from the
acquisitions of Global Shares and J.P. Morgan Asset
Management China and higher revenue-related
compensation.

The provision for credit losses was $160 million,
predominantly driven by a $146 million addition to the
allowance for credit losses to establish the allowance
for the First Republic loans and lending-related
commitments, in the second quarter of 2023.

The prior year provision for credit losses was $96
million driven by a net addition to the allowance for
credit losses.

Net income was $812 million, compared with a net loss
of $294 million in the prior year.

Net revenue was $1.6 billion, compared with a net loss
of $302 million in the prior year, driven by higher
net interest income due to higher rates.

Noninterest revenue was a loss of $425 million,
compared with a loss of $1.1 billion in the prior
year, driven by:

• lower net investment securities losses on sales of
U.S. Treasures and U.S. GSE and government agency MBS,
associated with repositioning the investment
securities portfolio,

• higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues
associated with foreign exchange rate movements risk
managed by Treasury and CIO,

• the impact of higher short-term cash deployment
activities as a result of the current interest rate
environment, and

• measurement period adjustments of $100 million
resulting in an increase to the estimated bargain
purchase gain associated with the First Republic
acquisition.

Noninterest expense of $696 million was up $391
million driven by:

• $240 million associated with First Republic, largely
driven by integration and restructuring costs,

• a greater benefit in the prior year on certain
expenses associated with foreign exchange rate
movements risk managed by Treasury and CIO , and

• higher legal expense,

partially offset by

• lower compensation expense.

Refer to Business Segment Results on page 23 for
additional information on First Republic.

associated with the foreign exchange risk that was
transferred to Treasury and CIO on certain revenues
and

Foreign Exchange Risk on page 21 for additional
information.

The current period tax expense was driven by changes
in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to
U.S. federal and state and local taxes that also
impacted the Firm’s tax reserves, including receipt of
interest associated with tax refunds.

Net income was $3.7 billion, compared with a net loss
of $1.3 billion in the prior year.

Net revenue was $6.3 billion, compared with a loss of
$1.1 billion in the prior year, driven by higher net
interest income due to higher rates, partially offset
by lower Firmwide average deposit balances available
for deployment in Treasury and CIO.

Noninterest revenue was $800 million, compared with a
loss of $1.7 billion, driven by:

• a $2.8 billion estimated bargain purchase gain
associated with the First Republic acquisition,

• higher losses in the prior year on certain revenues
associated with foreign exchange rate movements risk
managed by Treasury and CIO, and

• the impact of higher short-term cash deployment
activities as a result of the current interest rate
environment,

partially offset by

• higher net investment securities losses related to
the sales of U.S. Treasuries and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS, associated with repositioning
the investment securities portfolio,

• the absence of proceeds in the prior year from an
insurance settlement, and

• lower net gains related to certain other Corporate
investments .

Noninterest expense of $2.0 billion was up $1.3
billion driven by:

• $802 million associated with First Republic,
predominantly driven by expenses recorded in the
second quarter of 2023, for the First Republic
individuals who were not employees of the Firm until
July 2, 2023, as well as integration and restructuring
costs,

• a greater benefit in the prior year on certain
expenses associated with foreign exchange rate
movements risk managed by Treasury and CIO, and

• higher legal expense,

partially offset by

• lower compensation expense.

Refer to Business Segment Results on page 23 for
additional information on First Republic.

The provision for credit losses was $173 million,
predominantly driven by an addition to the allowance
for credit losses related to a single name exposure.

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on the
investment securities portfolio, and Note 13 for
additional information on the allowance for credit
losses.

The current period tax expense benefited from the
income tax expense associated with the First Republic
acquisition reflected in the estimated bargain
purchase gain, partially offset by changes in the
level and mix of income and

expenses subject to U.S. federal and state and local
taxes that also impacted the Firm's tax reserves.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorgan Chase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk
governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance framework The
Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and
impacts of risks. Refer to pages 81-84 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
Firmwide risk management governance and oversight.

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
Capital risk is the risk the Firm has an insufficient
level or composition of capital to support the Firm’s
business activities and associated risks during normal
economic environments and under stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 86-96 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K, Note 23 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar
3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s capital risk.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and
its insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The
minimum amount of regulatory capital that must be held
by BHCs and banks is determined by calculating risk-
weighted assets ("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet
assets and off-balance sheet exposures, weighted
according to risk. Two comprehensive approaches are
prescribed for calculating RWA: a standardized
approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and an advanced
approach (“Basel III Advanced”). For each of the risk-
based capital ratios, the capital adequacy of the Firm
is evaluated against the lower of the Standardized or
Advanced approaches compared to their respective
regulatory capital ratio requirements. The Firm’s
Basel III Standardized risk-based ratios are currently
more binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based
ratios.

Basel III also includes a requirement for Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
to calculate its SLR. Refer to SLR on page 51 for
additional information.

Key Regulatory Developments

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $2.9 billion CECL
capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out
at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of
September 30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected
the remaining $1.4 billion benefit associated with the
CECL capital transition provisions.

Similarly, as of January 1, 2023, the Firm has phased
out 50% of the other CECL capital transition
provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as
applicable.

Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 and
Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on CECL capital transition provisions and
the CECL accounting guidance.

U.S. Basel III Finalization

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") and the FDIC
released a proposal to amend the risk-based capital
framework, entitled "Regulatory capital rule:
Amendments applicable to large banking organizations
and to banking organizations with significant trading
activity". Under the proposal, changes would include
replacement of the advanced approach with an expanded
risk-based approach, which would not permit the use of
internal models for the calculation of risk-weighted
assets, other than for Market risk. In addition, the
stress capital buffer requirement would be applicable
to both the expanded risk-based approach and the
standardized approach. The proposal would
significantly revise risk-based capital requirements
for all banks with assets of $100 billion or more,
including the Firm and other U.S. global systemically
important banks ("GSIBs"). The proposed effective date
is July 1, 2025 with a three-year transition period
applicable to the expanded risk-based approach. Based
on the Firm's understanding of the proposal, as
applied to its Consolidated balance sheets as of June
30, 2023, the estimated impact at the end of the
transition period would be an increase to RWA of
approximately 30% which results in an approximately
25% increase to CET1 capital necessary to meet its
CET1 ratio requirement, all else equal. These
estimates do not reflect any actions that the Firm may
take to mitigate the impact of the rule as currently
proposed.

Pending the finalization of the U.S. Basel III
proposal, the Firm expects that it will continue to
build capital above the current levels, and therefore
the CET1 target of 13.5% previously set by the Firm
(which was with respect to the current Standardized
RWA measure) is no longer meaningful. The Firm's
quarterly capital ratios may vary dependent on market
conditions and other factors.

GSIB Surcharge

In July 2023, the Federal Reserve also released a
proposal to amend the calculation of the GSIB
surcharge. If adopted as proposed, these amendments
would require the Firm to assess its GSIB surcharge on
an annual basis, using the average of the quarterly
surcharge calculations throughout the calendar year,
with daily averaging required for certain measures
within the surcharge calculation. Surcharge increments
would be reduced from 50bp to 10bp and there would
also be other technical amendments to the Method 2
calculation. The proposed amendments would revise
risk-based capital requirements for the Firm and other
U.S. GSIBs, and would become effective on two calendar
quarters after the adoption of the final rule. Refer
to Risk-based Capital Regulatory Requirements on pages
89-90 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information on the GSIB surcharge.

TLAC and Eligible LTD Requirements

In August 2023, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the
OCC released a proposal to expand the eligible long-
term debt ("eligible LTD") and clean holding company
requirements under the existing total loss-absorbing
capacity ("TLAC") rule to apply to non-GSIB banks with
$100 billion or more in total consolidated assets.
While U.S. GSIBs are already subject to these
requirements, the proposal would reduce

the amount of LTD with remaining maturities of less
than two years that count towards a U.S. GSIB's TLAC
requirement. The proposal would also expand the
existing capital deduction framework for LTD issued by
GSIBs to include LTD issued by non-GSIB banks subject
to the LTD requirements.
                                                                                                                   
  Selected capital and RWA data                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
The following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and
Advanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 86-96 of JPMorgan
Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of these capital metrics. Refer to Note 23 for JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.’s risk-based and leverage-based capital metrics. First Republic Bank was not subject to Advanced approach
regulatory capital requirements. As a result, for certain exposures associated with the First Republic acquisition,
Advanced RWA and any impact on Advanced Total capital is calculated under the Standardized approach as permitted by
the transition provisions in the U.S. capital rules. Refer to Note 28 for additional information on the First
Republic acquisition.

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its contractual and contingent
financial obligations as they arise or that it does
not have the appropriate amount, composition and tenor
of funding and liquidity to support its assets and
liabilities. Refer to pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure
reports, which are available on the Firm’s website,
for a further discussion of the Firm’s liquidity risk.
LCR and HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of
eligible HQLA that is sufficient to meet their
respective estimated total net cash outflows over a
prospective 30 calendar-day period of significant
stress. Under the LCR rule, the amount of eligible
HQLA held by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that is in
excess of its stand-alone 100% minimum LCR
requirement, and that is not transferable to non-bank
affiliates, must be excluded from the Firm’s reported
eligible HQLA. The LCR for both the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is required to be a minimum of 100%.
The following table summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months
ended September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September
30, 2022 based on the Firm’s interpretation of the LCR
framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of applicable haircuts under the LCR rule.
(c) Eligible HQLA securities may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading
assets, or investment securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. (d) Excludes average excess eligible
HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. (e) End-of-period HQLA balances
were approximately $795.6 billion, $791.5 billion, and $709.0 billion for September 30, 2023, June 30, 2023 and
September 30, 2022, respectively.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR decreased during the three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with
the three months ended June 30, 2023, reflecting the full quarter impact associated with First Republic in the
third quarter as the First Republic acquisition occurred on May 1, 2023. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA was
further impacted by a reduction in cash primarily driven by a decline in average deposits and higher average loans,
predominantly offset by CIB market activities. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 decreased when compared with the same period in the prior year, reflecting a decrease in
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s HQLA as a result of a reduction in cash from a decline in average deposits and loan
growth, as well as the impact of First Republic and lower market values of HQLA-eligible investment securities.
Refer to Note 10 and Note 28 for additional information on the Firm's investment securities portfolio and the First
Republic acquisition. Actions by the Federal Reserve have impacted depositor behavior, resulting in reductions to
system-wide deposits, including those held by the Firm. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average
LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash
outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the continued impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well
as other factors. Refer to page 98 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports
for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal
liquidity stress testing that is intended to ensure that the Firm and its material legal entities have sufficient
liquidity under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and
recovery planning. Internal Stress scenarios are produced on a regular basis, and other stress tests are performed
in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the
Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm maintains liquidity at the Parent Company,
the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity
risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal
funding sources may be disrupted.
                                                        54                                                         
                                                                                                                   
   Other liquidity sources                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had
unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and
debt securities, that the Firm believes would be
available to raise liquidity. This includes excess
eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The
fair value of these securities was approximately $590
billion and $694 billion as of September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively, although the amount
of liquidity that could be raised at any particular
time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The decrease compared to December 31,
2022, was driven by a reduction in excess eligible
HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
partially offset by an increase in CIB trading assets.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLBs”) and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of
approximately $347 billion and $323 billion as of
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the
benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks
discount window and other central banks. Available
borrowing capacity increased from December 31, 2022
primarily due to increased commercial loans and credit
card receivables pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks.
Although available, the Firm does not view this
borrowing capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks
discount window and the other central banks as a
primary source of liquidity.

The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

As of September 30, 2023, both the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with the 100% minimum
NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's interpretation
of the final rule. Refer to the Firm's U.S. NSFR
Disclosure report covering June 30, 2023 and March 31,
2023 on the Firm’s website for additional information.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including stable deposits,
secured and unsecured funding in the capital markets
and stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary
funding source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
Additionally, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access
funding through short- or long-term secured
borrowings, through the issuance of unsecured long-
term debt, or from borrowings from the IHC. The

Firm’s non-bank subsidiaries are primarily funded from
long-term unsecured borrowings and short-term secured
borrowings which are primarily securities loaned or
sold under repurchase agreements. Excess funding is
invested by Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment
securities portfolio or deployed in cash or other
short-term liquid investments based on their interest
rate and liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 24 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion
of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and
wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods
of market disruption those trends could be affected.

Average deposits were lower for the three months ended
September 30, 2023 compared to the three months ended
September 30, 2022. The net decrease reflected:

• continued migration in AWM into higher-yielding
investments as a result of the rising interest rate
environment, partially offset by growth from new and
existing customers resulting from new offerings,

• a net decline in CCB reflecting higher customer
spending in existing accounts, largely offset by the
impact of First Republic,

• continued deposit attrition in CB as clients seek
higher yielding alternatives, partially offset by the
retention of inflows associated with disruptions in
the market in the first quarter of 2023,

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's
international consumer initiatives, and

• an increase in CIB due to net issuances of
structured notes as a result of client demand,
predominantly offset by continued deposit attrition,
including actions to reduce certain deposits.

Average deposits were lower for the nine months ended
September 30, 2023 compared to the nine months ended
September 30, 2022. The net decrease reflected:

• continued migration in AWM into higher-yielding
investments as a result of the rising interest rate
environment, partially offset by growth from new and
existing customers resulting from new offerings,

• continued deposit attrition in CIB, including
actions to reduce certain deposits, largely offset by
net issuances of structured notes as a result of
client demand,

• continued deposit attrition in CB as clients seek
higher yielding alternatives, partially offset by the
retention of inflows associated with disruptions in
the market in the first quarter of 2023,

• a net decline in CCB reflecting higher customer
spending in existing accounts, largely offset by the
impact of First Republic, and

• an increase in Corporate related to the Firm's

Period-end deposits increased when compared to
December 31, 2022. The net increase reflected: • net
issuances of structured notes in CIB as a result of
client demand, as well as deposit inflows related to
client-driven activities in Securities Services and
Payments, • an increase in Corporate related to the
Firm's international consumer initiatives, • a net
increase in CCB due to $64 billion of deposits
associated with First Republic, predominantly offset
by a net reduction reflecting higher customer spending
in existing accounts, • a net decrease in AWM from
continued migration into higher-yielding investments
as a result of the rising interest rate environment,
partially offset by growth from new and existing
customers resulting from new offerings, and •
continued deposit attrition in CB driven by higher
rates and seasonal outflows, partially offset by the
retention of inflows associated with disruptions in
the market in the first quarter of 2023. Refer to the
Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis and the
Business Segment Results on pages 16-18 and pages
21-46, respectively, for further information on
deposit and liability balance trends. Refer to Note 3
for further information on structured notes.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection
that provides additional funding stability and results
in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection
may be available to depositors in the countries in
which the deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC
provides deposit insurance protection for deposits
placed in a U.S. depository institution. At September
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 (a) , the Firmwide
estimated uninsured deposits were $1,332.4 billion and
$1,353.1 billion, respectively, primarily reflecting
wholesale operating deposits. Total uninsured deposits
include time deposits. The table below presents an
estimate of uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits,
and their remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates
of its uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data
that the Firm calculates periodically under applicable
FDIC regulations. For purposes of this presentation,
all non-U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s sources of short-term secured funding
primarily consist of securities loaned or sold under
agreements to repurchase. These instruments are
secured predominantly by high-quality securities
collateral, including government-issued debt and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at September 30,
2023, compared with December 31, 2022, due to higher
secured financing of trading assets and the impact of
a lower level of netting on client-driven market-
making activities in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s sources of short-term unsecured funding
primarily consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds.

The decrease in commercial paper for the average three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to
the prior year periods, and the increase in commercial
paper at September 30, 2023, from December 31, 2022,
were due to changes in net issuance levels primarily
for short-term liquidity management.

The decrease in average unsecured other borrowed funds
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023
compared to the prior year periods was primarily due
to a lower level of overdrafts.
                                                        59                                                         
                                                                                                                   
  Long-term funding and issuance                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal
long-term funding plan.

The significant majority of the Firm’s long-term unsecured funding is issued by the Parent Company to provide
flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external
counterparties. The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 18 of this Form 10-Q and Liquidity Risk
Management on pages 97-104 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term
debt.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above.
Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan
securitizations.
                                                        60                                                         
                                                                                                                   
  Credit ratings                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk

and stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to Note
5 and Note 14 for additional information.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and the
Firm’s principal bank and non-bank subsidiaries as of
September 30, 2023, were as follows:

  CREDIT AND INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                         
Credit and investment risk is the risk associated with
the default or change in credit profile of a client,
counterparty or customer; or loss of principal or a
reduction in expected returns on investments,
including consumer credit risk,

wholesale credit risk, and investment portfolio risk.
Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio, Wholesale Credit
Portfolio and

Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 65-82 for a
further discussion of Credit Risk.

Refer to page 83 for a further discussion of
Investment Portfolio Risk. Refer to Credit and
Investment Risk Management on pages 106-130 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s Credit and Investment Risk

  CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                    
Credit risk is the risk associated with the default or change in credit profile of a client, counterparty or
customer. In the following tables, total loans include loans retained (i.e., held-for-investment); loans held-for-
sale; and certain loans accounted for at fair value. The following tables do not include loans which the Firm
accounts for at fair value and classifies as trading assets; refer to Notes 2 and 3 for further information
regarding these loans. Refer to Notes 12, 24 and 5 for additional information on the Firm’s loans, lending-related
commitments and derivative receivables. Refer to Note 10 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in the
Firm’s investment securities portfolio; and refer to Note 11 for information regarding the credit risk inherent in
the securities financing portfolio. Refer to Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 65-69 and Note 12 for further
discussions of the consumer credit environment and consumer loans. Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio on pages
70-79 and Note 12 for further discussions of the wholesale credit environment and wholesale loans. On January 1,
2023, the Firm adopted changes to the TDR accounting guidance, which eliminated the accounting and disclosure
requirements for TDRs including the requirement to assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves
a concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness, interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant payment delay,
term extension or a combination of these modifications. The Firm has defined these types of modifications as
financial difficulty modifications ("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the requirement to assess whether a
modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered FDMs differs from
the population previously considered TDRs. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.

(d) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB, and other consumer unsecured loans in CIB.

(e) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available
lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines
of credit would be used at the same time. For credit card commitments, and if certain conditions are met, home
equity commitments and certain business banking commitments, the Firm can reduce or cancel these lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. Refer to Note 24 for further
information.

and insured by U.S. government agencies of $188 million and $302 million, respectively. These amounts have been
excluded from nonaccrual loans based upon the government guarantee. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to
exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(k) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(l) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, nonaccrual loans excluded $35 million and $101 million,
respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days past due and guaranteed by the SBA.

(m) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $14.4 billion and $14.9 billion for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and $12.9 billion and $19.0 billion for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-
off/(recovery) rates.

Portfolio analysis Loans increased compared to
December 31, 2022 driven by residential real estate
loans associated with First Republic and higher auto
loans. Residential real estate: The residential real
estate portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and
loans at fair value, predominantly consists of prime
mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit.
Retained loans increased compared to December 31,
2022, driven by residential real estate loans
associated with First Republic. Retained nonaccrual
loans decreased compared to December 31, 2022. Net
recoveries were lower for the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2023 compared to the same periods
in the prior year driven by lower prepayments due to
higher interest rates. Loans at fair value decreased
from December 31, 2022, driven by a decrease in CIB
due to sales outpacing purchases predominantly offset
by an increase in Home Lending as originations
outpaced warehouse loan sales. Nonaccrual loans at
fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2022,
predominantly driven by CIB. At September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, the carrying value of interest-only
residential mortgage loans was $90.9 billion and $36.3
billion, respectively. The increase was driven by
First Republic. These loans have an interest-only
payment period generally followed by an adjustable-
rate or fixed-rate fully amortizing payment period to
maturity and are typically originated as higher-
balance loans to higher-income borrowers. The credit
performance of this portfolio is comparable with the
performance of the broader prime mortgage portfolio
and there were no charge-offs associated with First
Republic for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023. The carrying value of home equity lines of
credit outstanding was $16.4 billion at September 30,
2023, which included $2.6 billion associated with
First Republic. The carrying value of home equity
lines of credit outstanding included $4.5 billion of
HELOCs that have recast from interest-only to fully
amortizing payments or have been modified and $4.5
billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs, which
primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages the risk
of HELOCs during their revolving period by closing or
reducing the undrawn line to the extent permitted by
law when borrowers are exhibiting a material
deterioration in their credit risk profile.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Geographic composition and current estimated loan-to-
value ratio of residential real estate loans At
September 30, 2023, $229.3 billion, or 70% of the
total retained residential real estate loan portfolio,
was concentrated in California, New York, Florida,
Texas and Massachusetts, compared with $147.8 billion,
or 62% at December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 12 for
information on the geographic composition and current
estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential real estate
loans. Modified residential real estate loans For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
residential real estate FDMs were $43 million and $110
million, respectively. In addition to FDMs, the Firm
also had $27 million and $59 million of loans subject
to trial modification where the terms of the loans
have not been permanently modified, as well as $3
million and $7 million of loans subject to discharge
under Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceedings ("Chapter 7
loans") for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, respectively. The changes to the TDR
accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably
expected and concession assessment criteria.
Accordingly, trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans
were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Refer to Note 1
and Note 12 for further information. For the three and
nine months ended September 30, 2022, residential real
estate TDRs were $80 million and $313 million,
respectively. Refer to Note 12 for further information
on TDRs in prior periods.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, consists of prime-
quality scored auto and business banking loans, other
consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The
portfolio increased when compared to December 31, 2022
due to originations of scored Auto loans and an
increase in other consumer unsecured fair value option
loans associated with First Republic, predominantly
offset by paydowns. Net charge-offs increased for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023
compared to the same periods in the prior year due to
higher charge-offs of scored Auto loans as delinquency
levels increased and vehicle valuations declined. The
net charge-off rates for scored Auto loans were 0.61%
and 0.27% for the three months ended September 30,
2023 and 2022, respectively, and 0.50% and 0.19% for
the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022,
respectively. Nonperforming assets The following table

Total credit card loans increased from December 31,
2022 reflecting growth from new accounts and revolving
balances which continued to normalize to pre-pandemic
levels. The September 30, 2023 30+ and 90+ day
delinquency rates of 1.94% and 0.94%, respectively,
increased compared to the December 31, 2022 30+ and
90+ day delinquency rates of 1.45% and 0.68%
respectively. Net charge-offs increased for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to
the same periods in the prior year as delinquencies
have normalized.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 12 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

Geographic and FICO composition of credit card loans

Refer to Note 12 for information on the geographic and
FICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.

For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, credit card FDMs were $197 million and $489
million, respectively. FDMs increased for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 compared to
credit card TDRs in the same periods in the prior
year, as delinquencies have normalized. In addition to
FDMs, the Firm also had $29 million of loans subject
to trial modification where the terms of the loans
have not been permanently modified for both the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023. The changes
to the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR
reasonably expected and concession assessment
criteria. Accordingly, trial modifications were
considered TDRs, but not FDMs.

For the three and nine months ended September 30,
2022, credit card TDRs were $111 million and $274
million, respectively.

Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further information.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 72-75 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, CB, AWM and Corporate, as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer exposure held in
CCB, for which the wholesale methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. The Firm
continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and services, associated with First
Republic to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. Accordingly, reporting classifications and internal
risk rating profiles in the wholesale portfolio may change in future periods. Refer to Business Developments on
page 9 for additional information. As of September 30, 2023, retained loans increased $68.3 billion predominantly
driven by the impact of First Republic. Lending-related commitments increased $59.6 billion driven by the impact of
First Republic, and net portfolio activity in CIB and CB. As of September 30, 2023, the increase in nonperforming
exposure was driven by loans, including a single name in Banks & Finance Companies and client-specific downgrades
in Real Estate and Healthcare, partially offset by a client-specific upgrade in civic organizations. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2023, wholesale charge-offs remained low, despite increased charge-offs in Office real
estate.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk rating profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as of
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position as of September 30,
2023, may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures deemed criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized exposures, which
consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure, excluding loans
held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $37.7 billion and $31.3 billion as of September 30, 2023 and December
31, 2022, representing approximately 3.0% and 2.7% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively . Criticized
exposure increased predominantly driven by Real Estate, including exposures associated with First Republic,
Technology, Media & Telecommunications (largely Technology), and Healthcare. Of the $37.7 billion of criticized
exposure at September 30, 2023, $34.1 billion was performing.

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans
to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate
and institutional clients to high-net-worth
individuals. Refer to Note 12 for a further discussion
on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality
indicators. The following table presents the change in
the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Since September 30,
2022, nonaccrual loan exposure increased by $1.1
billion driven by a single name in Banks & Finance
Companies and client-specific downgrades in Real
Estate and Healthcare, partially offset by a client-
specific upgrade in civic organizations.

Modified wholesale loans The amortized cost of
wholesale FDMs was $1.4 billion and $2.0 billion for
the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023,
respectively. Refer to Note 1 and Note 12 for further
information. Wholesale TDRs were $108 million and $587
million for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2022, respectively. As a result of the elimination
of the requirement to assess whether a modification is
reasonably expected or involves a concession, the
population of loans considered FDMs is greater than
the population previously considered TDRs. Refer to
Note 12 for further information on TDRs in prior
periods.

The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 24 for

  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit,
and liquid and readily marketable debt or equity
securities). Because of this collateralization, no
allowance for credit losses is generally held against
these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm
establishes margin requirements and monitors the
required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
These receivables are reported within accrued interest
and accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated
balance sheets.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the credit risk to
which the Firm is exposed. For over-the-counter
("OTC") derivatives the Firm is exposed to the credit
risk of the derivative counterparty. For exchange-
traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures and
options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-cleared”)
derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to the
credit risk of the relevant central counterparty
clearing house (“CCP”). Where possible, the Firm seeks
to mitigate its credit risk exposures arising from
derivative contracts through the use of legally
enforceable master netting arrangements and collateral
agreements.

The percentage of the Firm’s over-the-counter
derivative transactions subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity, and centrally
cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 88% and 87% at September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively. Refer to Note 5 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements and for a further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets was $67.1 billion and
$70.9 billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven
by market movements. Derivative receivables represent
the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the
Firm.

In addition, the Firm held liquid securities and other
cash collateral that may be used as security when the
fair value of the client’s exposure is in the Firm’s
favor. For these purposes, the definition of liquid
securities is consistent with the definition of high
quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits
of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount
of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
balances and is not included in the tables below, it
is available as security against potential exposure
that could arise should the fair value of the client’s
derivative contracts move in the Firm’s favor. Refer
to Note 5 for additional information on the Firm’s use
of collateral agreements for derivatives transactions.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally consists of : •
the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated), •
the allowance for lending-related commitments, which
is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities
on the Consolidated balance sheets, and • the
allowance for credit losses on investment securities,
which is reflected in investment securities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Discussion of changes in
the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of
September 30, 2023 was $24.2 billion, reflecting a net
addition of $2.5 billion from December 31, 2022. The
net addition to the allowance for credit losses
included $1.4 billion, consisting of: • $707 million
in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB, comprised
of $801 million in Card Services, partially offset by
a $200 million net reduction in Home Lending. The net
addition in Card Services was driven by loan growth,
including an increase in revolving balances, partially
offset by reduced borrower uncertainty and the net
effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average
macroeconomic outlook. The net reduction in Home
Lending was largely driven by improvements in the
outlook for home prices, and • $623 million in
wholesale , driven by net downgrade activity, the net
effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average
macroeconomic outlook, including deterioration in the
outlook for commercial real estate in CB, partially
offset by the impact of changes in the loan and
lending-related commitment portfolios in CIB in the
third quarter of 2023. The net addition also included
$1.2 billion to establish the allowance for the First
Republic loans and lending-related commitments in the
second quarter of 2023. The changes in the Firm's
weighted average macroeconomic outlook included
updates to the central scenario in the third quarter
of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment
rate consistent with a higher growth rate in GDP. The
Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also
reflects the impact of the additional weight placed on
the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023,
reflecting elevated recession risks due to high
inflation and tightening financial conditions. The
allowance for credit losses also reflected a reduction
of $587 million as a result of the adoption of changes
to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023.
Refer to Note 1 for further information.

The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated
using a weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios
incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than
the central case assumptions provided in the table
below, resulting in a weighted average U.S.
unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth
quarter of 2024, and a 1.8% lower U.S. real GDP
exiting the fourth quarter of 2024. The Firm’s central
case assumptions reflected U.S. unemployment rates and
U.S. real GDP as follows:

(a) Represents the impact to the allowance for loan losses upon the Firm's adoption of changes to the TDR
accounting guidance on January 1, 2023. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the existing accounting and
disclosure requirements for TDRs, including the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow
("DCF") methodology. The Firm elected to change from an asset-specific allowance approach to its non-DCF,
portfolio-based allowance approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-
dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-specific allowance approach will continue to
apply. Refer to Note 1 for further information.

(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans for all periods presented. Prior periods also include non collateral-dependent TDRs or reasonably
expected TDRs and modified purchased credit deteriorated ("PCD") loans.

(c) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm
also had an allowance for credit losses of $17 million and $30 million, respectively, associated with certain
accounts receivable in CIB.

(d) As of September 30, 2023 included $1.2 billion allowance for credit losses associated with First Republic.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At September 30,
2023, the Treasury and CIO investment securities
portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was
$583.5 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate segment results on pages
45-46 and Note 10 for further information on the
investment securities portfolio and internal risk
ratings. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
54-61 for further information on related liquidity
risk. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages 84-89
for further information on the market risk inherent in
the portfolio.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve in line with its strategies, including the
Firm’s commitment to support underserved communities
and minority-owned businesses. The table below
presents the aggregate carrying values of the
principal investment portfolios as of September 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
131-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.
                                                                                                                   
  Value-at-risk                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
JPMorgan Chase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 148 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 133 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including the
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorgan Chase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, f or additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting) . Refer to Other risk measures on pages
136-138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

(a) Divers ification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual
components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and
risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR
for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.

(b) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio,
which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which
is not reported at fair value. In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the
credit risk component of CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the
widening of the credit spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to
maintain consistency. This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Corporate and other LOB VaR includes a legacy private equity position in Corporate which is publicly traded.

Average total VaR decreased by $6 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, when compared

volatility rolling out of the one-year historical
look-back period which primarily impacted fixed
income, partially offset by increases in the foreign
exchange risk type.

Average total VaR decreased by $13 million for the
three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with
the same period in the prior year driven by reduced
market volatility as well as risk reductions impacting
fixed income, partially offset by increases in the
foreign exchange risk type.

The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five
times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended September 30, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 137 of the 258 days, and observed
nine VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, the Firm posted backtesting gains
on 36 of the 65 days, and observed one VaR backtesting exception.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended September 30, 2023. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities but also from the Firm’s traditional
banking activities, which include extension of loans
and credit facilities, taking deposits, issuing debt
and the investment securities portfolio. One way that
the Firm evaluates its structural interest rate risk
is through earnings-at-risk. Earnings-at-risk
estimates the Firm’s interest rate exposure for a
given interest rate scenario. It is presented as a
sensitivity to a baseline, which includes net interest
income and certain interest rate sensitive fees. The
baseline uses market interest rates and in the case of
deposits, pricing assumptions. The Firm conducts
simulations of changes to this baseline for interest
rate-sensitive assets and liabilities denominated in
U.S. dollars and other currencies (“non-U.S. dollar”
currencies). These simulations primarily include
retained loans, deposits, deposits with banks,
investment securities, long-term debt and any related
interest rate hedges, and funds transfer pricing of
other positions in risk management VaR and other
sensitivity-based measures as described on page 132 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. Earnings-at-risk
scenarios estimate the potential change to a net
interest income baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both
short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and
holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term
rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These
scenarios consider many different factors, including:
• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates. •
Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in
the Firm's earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects
certain assumptions relating to the reversal of
Quantitative Easing that are highly uncertain and
require management judgment. Therefore, the actual
amount of deposits held by the Firm, at any particular
time, could be impacted by actions the Federal Reserve
may take as part of monetary policy, including through
the use of the Reverse Repurchase Facility. In
addition, there are other factors that impact the
amount of deposits held at the Firm such

as the level of loans across the industry and
competition for deposits. • The pricing sensitivity of
deposits, known as deposit betas, represent the amount
by which deposit rates paid could change upon a given
change in market interest rates. As part of the Firm's
continuous evaluation and periodic enhancements to its
earnings-at-risk calculations, the Firm updated its
model in the second quarter of 2023 to incorporate
deposit repricing lags impacting both consumer and
wholesale deposits. The model change incorporated
observed pricing and customer behavior in both rising
and falling interest rate environments. Actual deposit
rates paid may differ from the modeled assumptions,
primarily due to customer behavior and competition for
deposits. The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are
periodically evaluated and enhanced in response to
changes in the composition of the Firm’s balance
sheet, changes in market conditions, improvements in
the Firm’s simulation and other factors. While a
relevant measure of the Firm’s interest rate exposure,
the earnings-at-risk analysis does not represent a
forecast of the Firm’s net interest income. Refer to
Outlook on page 8 for additional information. The
Firm’s U.S. dollar sensitivities are presented in the
table below.

(a) Reflects the impact of the aforementioned model
update to incorporate deposit repricing lags. Prior
periods have not been revised. In the absence of the
model update to incorporate deposit repricing lags in
the second quarter of 2023, the Firm's U.S. dollar
sensitivities as of September 30, 2023, would have
been lower by $4.2 billion to the +100 basis points
shift in short-term and parallel rate scenarios and
higher by $4.4 billion to the -100 basis points shift
in short-term and parallel rate scenarios. In
addition, the change in the Firm’s U.S. dollar
sensitivities as of September 30, 2023 compared to
December 31, 2022 reflected the impact of changes in
the Firm’s balance sheet including the impact of the
First Republic acquisition. As of September 30, 2023,
the Firm’s sensitivity to the +/-100 basis points
parallel shift in rates is primarily the result of a
greater impact from assets repricing compared to the
impact of liabilities repricing.
                                                        87                                                         
The Firm continues to convert certain operations and
to integrate products associated with the First
Republic acquisition to align with the Firm’s business
and operations. The Firm also continues to evaluate to
which segments certain products associated with the
First Republic acquisition, primarily deposits, should
be allocated. Accordingly, earnings-at-risk results
may be impacted in future periods. The Firm’s non-U.S.
dollar sensitivities are presented in the table below.

The results of the non-U.S. dollar interest rate
scenario involving a steeper/flatter yield curve with
long-term rates increasing/decreasing by 100 basis
points and short-term rates staying at current levels
were not material to the Firm’s earnings-at-risk at
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 . In addition
to earnings-at-risk, the Firm also measures Economic
Value Sensitivity (EVS). EVS stress tests the longer-
term economic value of equity by measuring the
sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet,
primarily retained loans, deposits, debt and
investment securities as well as related hedges, under
various interest rate scenarios. In accordance with
the CTC structural interest rate risk policy, the Firm
has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE.

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 138 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at September 30, 2023 and December
31, 2022, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply
management’s expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

(a) Excludes equity securities without readily determinable fair values that are measured under the measurement
alternative. Refer to Note 2 for additional information.

(b) In the first quarter of 2022, in line with the Firm's internal model governance, the credit risk component of
CVA related to certain counterparties was removed from Credit Portfolio VaR due to the widening of the credit
spreads for those counterparties to elevated levels. The related hedges were also removed to maintain consistency.
This exposure is now reflected in other sensitivity-based measures.

(c) Impact recognized through net revenue.

(d) Impact recognized through noninterest expense.

(e) Impact recognized through OCI.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 139-140 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table
presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of September 30, 2023 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2022. The selection of countries represents the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country, based on the Firm’s internal country risk management approach, and does not represent the
Firm’s view of any existing or potentially adverse credit conditions. Country exposures may fluctuate from period
to period due to client activity and market flows. The decrease in exposure to Japan when compared to December 31,
2022, was driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Japan as a result of liquidity management
activities undertaken by the Firm and client-driven activities. The decrease in exposure to Australia when compared
to December 31, 2022, was driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central bank of Australia in the first
quarter of 2023 due to client-driven activities resulting from changes in interest rates. . In addition, in the
third quarter of 2023, the exposures to Germany and the United Kingdom decreased by $18.6 billion and $13.6
billion, respectively, when compared to June 30, 2023 primarily driven by decreases in cash placed with the central
banks of those countries as a result of liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm and client-driven
activities. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia which was approximately $400 million as of
September 30, 2023 based on the Firm's internal country risk measurement framework. This amount excludes certain
deposits placed on behalf of clients at the Depository Insurance Agency of Russia.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally consists of:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated).

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, which
is reflected in accounts payable and other liabilities
on the Consolidated balance sheets, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities, which is reflected in investment
securities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses; and
refer to Allowance for credit losses on pages 80-82
and Note 13 of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-
quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses
being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty

variables. The specific variables that have the
greatest effect on the modeled losses of each
portfolio vary by portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional
U.S. unemployment and HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.
interest rates, corporate credit spreads, oil prices,
commercial real estate prices and HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

As a result of the First Republic acquisition, the
Firm recorded an allowance for credit losses for the
loans acquired and lending-related commitments assumed
as of May 1, 2023. Given the differences in risk
rating methodologies for the First Republic portfolio,
and the ongoing integration of products and systems,
the allowance for credit losses for the acquired
wholesale portfolio was measured based on other
facilities underwritten by the Firm with similar risk
characteristics and not based on modeled estimates. As
such, the First Republic wholesale portfolio is
excluded from the modeled estimates sensitivity
analysis below. The allowance for credit losses for
predominantly all of the consumer portfolio was
measured using the Firm’s modeled approach, as the
consumer portfolio is predominantly residential real
estate that has more commonly defined risk
characteristics including loan to value ratio and
credit score, and therefore is reflected in the
sensitivity analysis below. Refer to Note 28 for
additional information on the First Republic
acquisition.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 80 and in Note 13, the Firm’s relative
                                                        91                                                         
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 1.9% higher over the
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of 2.7%
in the third quarter of 2024; lower U.S. real GDP with
a slower recovery, remaining approximately 3.7% lower
at the end of the eight-quarter forecast, with a peak
difference of approximately 4.5% in the third quarter
of 2024; and lower national HPI with a peak difference
of approximately 16.2% in the second quarter of 2025.
This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including: • The allowance as of
September 30, 2023, reflects credit losses beyond
those estimated under the central scenario due to the
weight placed on the adverse scenarios. • The impacts
of changes in many MEVs are both interrelated and
nonlinear, so the results of this analysis cannot be
simply extrapolated for more severe changes in
macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of future
changes in portfolio composition and borrower behavior
can significantly affect the allowance for credit
losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of credit loss
estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of September
30, 2023, the Firm compared the modeled estimates
under its relative adverse scenario to its central
scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated
effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses, the comparison between
these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect
the following differences: • An increase of
approximately $950 million for residential real estate
loans and lending-related commitments, including the
First Republic portfolios • An increase of
approximately $3.1 billion for credit card loans ▪ An
increase of approximately $4.1 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments, excluding the
First Republic portfolios. This analysis relates only
to the modeled credit loss estimates and is not
intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance
for credit losses as it does not reflect any potential
changes in other adjustments to the quantitative
calculation, which would also be influenced by the
judgment management applies to the modeled lifetime
loss estimates to reflect the uncertainty and
imprecision of these modeled lifetime loss estimates
based on then-current circumstances and conditions.
Recognizing that forecasts of macroeconomic conditions
are inherently uncertain, particularly in light of the
recent economic conditions, the Firm believes that its
process to consider the available information and
associated risks and uncertainties is appropriately
governed and that its estimates of expected credit
losses were reasonable and appropriate for the period
ended September 30, 2023.

Fair value JPMorgan Chase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including derivatives,
structured note products and certain securities
financing agreements. Certain assets and liabilities
are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
including certain mortgage, home equity and other
loans, where the carrying value is based on the fair
value of the underlying collateral. Assets measured at
fair value The following table includes the Firm’s
assets measured at fair value and the portion of such
assets that are classified within level 3 of the fair
value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2 for further

Valuation
Estimating fair value requires the application of
judgment. The type and level of judgment required is
largely dependent on the amount of observable market
information available to the Firm. For instruments
valued using internally developed valuation models and
other valuation techniques that use significant
unobservable inputs and are therefore classified
within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, judgments
used to estimate fair value are more significant than
those required when estimating the fair value of
instruments classified within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.
                                                                                                                   
  Credit card rewards liability                                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
The credit card rewards liability was $12.9 billion
and $11.3 billion at September 30, 2023 and December
31, 2022, respectively, and is recorded in accounts
payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The increase in the liability was
predominantly driven by continued growth in rewards
points earned on higher spend and promotional offers
outpacing redemptions throughout 2023, and, to a
lesser extent, adjustments to certain reward program
terms in the second quarter of 2023. Refer to pages
151-152 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
description of the significant assumptions and
sensitivities, associated with the Firm’s credit card
rewards liability.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
                              
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorgan Chase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorgan Chase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorgan Chase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase” or the “Firm”), a financial holding company incorporated under Delaware law
in 1968, is a leading financial services firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The Firm is a leader in
investment banking, financial services for consumers and small businesses, commercial banking, financial
transaction processing and asset management. On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets and assumed
certain liabilities of First Republic Bank (the “First Republic acquisition”) from the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation (“FDIC”). The Firm continues to convert certain operations, and to integrate clients, products and
services associated with the First Republic acquisition, to align with the Firm’s businesses and operations. The
Firm also continues to evaluate to which segments certain clients, products and services, primarily deposits,
should be allocated. Accordingly, reporting classifications and allocations may change in future periods, including
across the Firm's segments. Refer to Note 27 for a further discussion of the Firm’s business segments and Note 28
for additional information on the First Republic acquisition. The accounting and financial reporting policies of
JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S. GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies conform to
the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by regulatory authorities. The unaudited Consolidated Financial
Statements prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expense, and the disclosures of contingent assets and
liabilities. Actual results could be different from these estimates. In the opinion of management, all normal,
recurring adjustments have been included such that this interim financial information is fairly stated. These
unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial
Statements, and related notes thereto, included in JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K. Certain amounts reported in
prior periods have been revised to conform with the current presentation. Consolidation The Consolidated Financial
Statements include the accounts of JPMorgan Chase and other entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial
interest. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for clients in an
agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm are not assets of JPMorgan Chase and are not included on the Consolidated
balance sheets. The Firm determines whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity by first
evaluating whether the entity is a voting interest entity or a variable interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of JPMorgan Chase’s accounting policies regarding
consolidation. Offsetting assets and liabilities U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative receivables and
derivative payables with the same counterparty and the related cash collateral receivables and payables on a net
basis on the Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also
permits securities financing balances to be presented on a net basis when specified conditions are met, including
the existence of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The Firm has elected to net such balances where it
has determined that the specified conditions are met. Refer to Note 1 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for
further information on offsetting assets and liabilities. Accounting standards adopted January 1, 2023 Derivatives
and Hedging: Fair Value Hedging – Portfolio Layer Method The adoption of this guidance expanded the ability to
hedge a portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. Non-prepayable assets can also
be included in the same portfolio, thus increasing the size of the portfolio and the amount available to be hedged.
This guidance also clarified the types of derivatives that can be used as hedges, and the balance sheet
presentation and disclosure requirements for the hedge accounting adjustments. As permitted by the guidance, the
Firm elected to transfer HTM securities to AFS and designate those securities in a portfolio layer method hedge
upon adoption. The adoption impact of the transfer on retained earnings was not material. Refer to Note 5 and Note
10 for additional information. Financial Instruments – Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage
Disclosures The adoption of this guidance eliminated the accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, including
the requirement to measure the allowance using a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) methodology, and allowed the option
of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers. If a DCF methodology is still
applied for these modified loans, the discount rate must be the post-
                                                        101                                                        
modification effective interest rate, instead of the
pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm
elected to apply its non-DCF, portfolio-based
allowance approach for modified loans to troubled
borrowers for all portfolios except collateral-
dependent loans and nonaccrual risk-rated loans which
the Firm elected to continue applying a DCF
methodology. Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for a description of the portfolio-based
allowance approach and the asset-specific allowance
approach. This guidance was adopted under the modified
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease
to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587million and
an increase to retained earnings of $ 446million,
after-tax, predominantly driven by residential real
estate and credit card. The adoption of this guidance
eliminated the disclosure requirements for TDRs
including the requirement to assess whether a
modification is reasonably expected or involves a
concession. The new guidance requires disclosure for
loan modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty consisting of principal forgiveness,
interest rate reduction, other-than-insignificant
payment delay, term extension or a combination of
these modifications. The Firm has defined these types
of modifications as financial difficulty modifications
("FDMs"). As a result of the elimination of the
requirement to assess whether a modification is
reasonably expected or involves a concession, the
population of loans considered FDMs differs from the
population previously considered TDRs. This guidance
also requires disclosure of current period gross
charge-offs by vintage origination year. Refer to Note
12 for further information.

(a) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 90.8billion and $
73.8billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in fair value. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge
accounting relationships. To provide consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities
inventories have been included in each period presented.
                                                        105                                                        
(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds,
real estate and other funds, were $ 1.0billion and $ 950million, respectively. Included in these balances at
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, were trading assets of $ 42million and $ 43million, respectively, and
other assets of $ 997million and $ 907million, respectively.

(e) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, included $ 9.4billion and $ 9.7billion, respectively, of
residential first-lien mortgages, and $ 6.2billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively, of commercial first-lien
mortgages. Residential mortgage loans include conforming mortgage loans originated with the intent to sell to U.S.
GSEs and government agencies of $ 3.7billion and $ 2.4billion, respectively.

(f) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-parameter based on the
characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 779million, nonagency securities of $ 5million and
non-trading loans of $ 880million.

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 13million, trading loans of $ 72million and non-trading loans of $
2.2billion.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 976million and non-trading loans of $ 633million.

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 830million including $ 680million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to
Note 2 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the impact on fair value of changes in
unobservable inputs and the relationships between
unobservable inputs as well as a description of
attributes of the underlying instruments and external
market factors that affect the range of inputs used in
the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in
level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the
Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes
in fair value) for financial instruments classified by
the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy
for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and
2022. When a determination is made to classify a
financial instrument within level 3, the determination
is based on the significance of the unobservable
inputs to the overall fair value measurement. However,
level 3 financial instruments typically include, in
addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are
actively quoted and can be validated to external
sources); accordingly, the gains and losses in the
table below include changes in fair value due in part
to observable factors that are part of the valuation
methodology. Also, the Firm risk-manages the
observable components of level 3 financial instruments
using securities and derivative positions that are
classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk
management instruments are not included below, the
gains or losses in the following tables do not reflect
the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities
related to such level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2022, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 115 for further information on changes impacting
items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 Level 3 assets
were $ 27.3billion at September 30, 2023, reflecting an increase of $ 523million from June 30, 2023, and an
increase of $ 3.7billion from December 31, 2022. The increase for the three months ended September 30, 2023 was
driven by: • $ 880million in MSRs. The increase for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 was predominantly
driven by: • $ 2.3billion in non-trading loans primarily due to $ 1.8billion of loans in CIB associated with First
Republic. • $ 1.1billion in MSRs. Refer to Note 15 for information on MSRs. Refer to the sections below for
additional information. Transfers between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the
three months ended September 30, 2023, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3. For the three
months ended September 30, 2023, there were no significant transfers from level 3 into level 2. For the nine months
ended September 30, 2023, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 1.8billion of
gross interest rate derivative payables as a result of transition to term SOFR for certain interest rate options. •
$ 1.2billion of gross equity derivative receivables as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in
the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 1.2billion of non-trading loans driven by a decrease in observability.
For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the
following: • $ 1.7billion and $ 1.2billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative
payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of
unobservable inputs. For the three months ended September 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3
included the following: • $ 1.1billion of gross interest rate derivative receivables as a result of a decrease in
observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the three months ended September 30,
2022, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 524million of gross equity
derivative receivables as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of
unobservable inputs. For the nine months ended September 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3
included the following: • $ 2.0billion of total debt and equity instruments, predominantly due to equity securities
of $ 977million driven by a decrease in observability as a result of restricted access to certain markets and
trading loans of $ 777million driven by a decrease in observability. • $ 1.5billion and $ 639million of gross
interest rate derivative receivables and gross interest rate derivative payables, respectively, as a result of a
decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 963million and $
1.8billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a result
of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 829million of non-
trading loans driven by a decrease in observability. • $ 739million of long-term debt driven by a decrease in
observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. For the nine
months ended September 30, 2022, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $
1.0billion and $ 758million of gross interest rate derivative receivables and gross interest rate derivative
payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of
unobservable inputs.
                                                        113                                                        
• $ 1.4billion and $ 1.8billion of gross equity
derivative receivables and gross equity derivative
payables, respectively, as a result of an increase in
observability and a decrease in the significance of
unobservable inputs. • $ 764million of non-trading
loans driven by an increase in observability. • $
878million of long-term debt driven by an increase in
observability and a decrease in the significance of
unobservable inputs for certain structured notes. All
transfers are based on changes in the observability
and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are
assumed to occur at the beginning of the quarterly
reporting period in which they occur. Gains and losses
The following describes significant components of
total realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for
instruments measured at fair value on a recurring
basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude
any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities

determinable fair values that were adjusted based on observable price changes in orderly transactions from an
identical or similar investment of the same issuer (measurement alternative). Of the $ 1.3billion in level 3 assets
measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2023, $ 396million related to equity securities
adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity securities are classified as level 3 due to the
infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the shares.
(b) Of the $ 1.0billion in level 3 loans measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of September 30, 2023, $
60million related to residential real estate loans carried at the net realizable value of the underlying collateral
(e.g., collateral-dependent loans). These amounts are classified as level 3 as they are valued using information
from broker’s price opinions, appraisals and automated valuation models and discounted based upon the Firm’s
experience with actual liquidation values. These discounts ranged from 10% to 56% with a weighted average of 25%.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of September 30, 2023 and 2022 , that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 37million Visa Class B common shares (“Visa
B shares”). These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common
shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters
involving Visa. On October 2, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC indicating that the
conversion rate of Visa B shares to Visa A shares decreased from 1.5902to 1.5875effective September 28, 2023. The
conversion rate may be further adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The
outcome of those litigation matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion
rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2023, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the
transfer restrictions on Visa B shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B shares
will be. As a result of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B shares are not
considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and they continue to be held at their nominal carrying value.

In connection with prior sales of Visa B shares, the Firm has entered into derivative instruments with the
purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the conversion rate.
Under the terms of the derivative instruments, the Firm will (a) make or receive payments based on subsequent
changes in the conversion rate and (b) make periodic interest payments to the purchasers of the Visa B shares. The
payments under the derivative instruments will continue as long as the Visa B shares remain subject to transfer
restrictions. The derivative instruments are accounted for at fair value using a discounted cash flow methodology
based upon the Firm’s estimate of the timing and magnitude of final resolution of the litigation matters. The
derivative instruments are recorded in trading liabilities, and changes in fair value are recognized in other
income. As of September 30, 2023, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 23million Visa B shares that
the Firm had previously sold, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

On September 13, 2023, Visa filed a Current Report on Form 8-K with the SEC announcing that Visa is engaging with
its common stockholders on potential amendments to its Certificate of Incorporation that would authorize Visa to
conduct an exchange offer program ("the Program") and have the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on
portions of Visa's Class B common stock. The amendments would become effective only if approved by a majority of
the outstanding shares of Visa's Class A, Class B and Class C common stock, each voting as a separate class. The
Program, if approved as proposed, would entitle the Firm to sell up to 50% of the Firm's Visa B shares through an
initial exchange offer and would also provide for the potential of future exchange offers.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
(b) Includes FHLB advances in level 2 of Long-term debt and Short-term borrowings and the Purchase Money Note in
level 3 of Long-term debt associated with First Republic. Refer to Notes 18 and 28 for additional information.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is
recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.
(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.
(c) As of September 30, 2023, includes fair value adjustments associated with First Republic for other unfunded
commitments to extend credit totaling $ 1.3billion recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Notes 24 and 28 for additional information.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments by providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by
law, without notice. Refer to page 169 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the valuation
of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities,
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The
profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be
measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are
not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were not material both for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(d) Reported in other income.

(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 7 for further information
regarding interest income and interest expense.

Difference between aggregate fair value and aggregate remaining contractual principal balance outstanding
The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining
contractual principal balance outstanding as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, for loans, long-term debt
and long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of September 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022.
(c) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(d) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the
fair value option was elected was $ 13.0billion and $ 7.6billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of
$ 247million and $ 24million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K, and Note 24 of
this Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

  Note 4 – Credit risk concentrations                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Concentrations of credit risk arise when a number of clients, counterparties or customers are engaged in similar
business activities or activities in the same geographic region, or when they have similar economic features that
would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic
conditions. JPMorgan Chase regularly monitors various segments of its credit portfolios to assess potential credit
risk concentrations and to obtain additional collateral when deemed necessary and permitted under the Firm’s
agreements. Senior management is significantly involved in the credit approval and review process, and risk levels
are adjusted as needed to reflect the Firm’s risk appetite. In the Firm’s consumer portfolio, concentrations are
managed primarily by product and by U.S. geographic region, with a key focus on trends and concentrations at the
portfolio level, where potential credit risk concentrations can be remedied through changes in underwriting
policies and portfolio guidelines. Refer to Note 12 for additional information on the geographic composition of the
Firm’s consumer loan portfolios. In the wholesale portfolio, credit risk concentrations are evaluated primarily by
industry and monitored regularly on both an aggregate portfolio level and on an individual client or counterparty
basis. The Firm’s wholesale exposure is managed through loan syndications and participations, loan sales,
securitizations, credit derivatives, master netting agreements, collateral and other risk-reduction techniques.
Refer to Note 12 for additional information on loans. The Firm does not believe that its exposure to any particular
loan product or industry segment results in a significant concentration of credit risk. Terms of loan products and
collateral coverage are included in the Firm’s assessment when extending credit and establishing its allowance for
loan losses.
                                                        122                                                        
The table below presents both on–balance sheet and off–balance sheet consumer and wholesale credit exposure by the
Firm’s three credit portfolio segments as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The wholesale industry of
risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

(a) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CB and CIB.
(b) The industry rankings presented in the table as of December 31, 2022, are based on the industry rankings of the
corresponding exposures as of September 30, 2023, not actual rankings of such exposures at December 31, 2022.
(c) Individuals and Individual Entities predominantly consists of Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P.
Morgan Wealth Management within CCB, and includes exposure to personal investment companies and personal and
testamentary trusts.
(d) In addition to the credit risk exposure to states and municipal governments (both U.S. and non-U.S.) as of
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, noted above, the Firm held: $ 6.3billion and $ 6.6billion, respectively,
of trading assets; $ 19.7billion and $ 6.8billion, respectively, of AFS securities; and $ 10.7billion and $
19.7billion, respectively, of HTM securities, issued by U.S. state and municipal governments. Refer to Note 2 and
Note 10 for further information.
(e) All other includes: SPEs and Private education and civic organizations, representing approximately 94% and 6%,
respectively, as of September 30, 2023 and 95% and 5%, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. Refer to Note 14 for
more information on exposures to SPEs.
(f) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the clients’ brokerage accounts (e.g., cash on deposit, liquid and
readily marketable debt or equity securities). Because of this collateralization, no allowance for credit losses is
generally held against these receivables. To manage its credit risk the Firm establishes margin requirements and
monitors the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate. These receivables are reported within accrued interest and
accounts receivable on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
(g) Excludes cash placed with banks of $ 502.8billion and $ 556.6billion, as of September 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022, respectively, which is predominantly placed with various central banks, primarily Federal Reserve Banks.
(h) Credit exposure is net of risk participations and excludes the benefit of credit derivatives used in credit
portfolio management activities held against derivative receivables or loans and liquid securities and other cash
collateral held against derivative receivables.

credit card portfolio, and $ 95.2billion in the Wholesale portfolio predominantly in Asset Managers, Real Estate,

JPMorgan Chase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on page
135 for more information on volumes and types of
credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        126                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, gross and net derivative receivables
and payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables below.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables below, up to the
fair value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent
with the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables below; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables below.

of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the
case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances
with that counterparty.
(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $ 57.8billion and $ 51.5billion at September 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $ 70.9billion
and $ 69.2billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to
OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.

Liquidity risk and credit-related contingent features

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of liquidity risk and credit-
related contingent features related to the Firm’s derivative contracts.
The following table shows the aggregate fair value of net derivative payables related to OTC and OTC-cleared
derivatives that contain contingent collateral or termination features that may be triggered upon a ratings
downgrade, and the associated collateral the Firm has posted in the normal course of business, at September 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination
features that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional
collateral to be posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A
downgrade by a single rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating
provided by another major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain
instances in which additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment
requirements. The liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current
rating of the rating agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

Derivatives executed in contemplation of a sale of the underlying financial asset

In certain instances the Firm enters into transactions in which it transfers financial assets but maintains the
economic exposure to the transferred assets by entering into a derivative with the same counterparty in
contemplation of the initial transfer. The Firm generally accounts for such transfers as collateralized financing
transactions as described in Note 11, but in limited circumstances they may qualify to be accounted for as a sale
and a derivative under U.S. GAAP. The amount of such transfers accounted for as a sale where the associated
derivative was outstanding was not material at both September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied
to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 11.9billion and $ 26.0billion at September 30, 2023
and December 31, 2022, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At September
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities is $ 24.9billion and $ 20.3billion,
respectively, and for long-term debt is $ 209million and $ 221million, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. Effective January 1, 2023, the
Firm adopted the new portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which expanded the ability to hedge a
portfolio of prepayable assets to allow more of the portfolio to be hedged. At September 30, 2023, the amortized
cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 64.9billion, of which $ 63.5billion was designated as
hedged. The cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $( 3.1) billion, reflecting $( 2.9) billion and $( 207)
million for active and discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer to Note 1 and Note 10 for additional
information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will
reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.
(e) Represents basis adjustments existing on the balance sheet date associated with hedged items that have been de-
designated from qualifying fair value hedging relationships.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the
same line item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net
interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and 2022.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.7) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in
AOCI at September 30, 2023, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that
have been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be
recognized in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged
forecasted cash flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are
hedged is approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and
borrowing activities.

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The Firm elects to record changes in
fair value of these amounts directly in other income.
(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income on the sale or liquidation of hedged entities. During the

Gains and losses on derivatives used for specified
risk management purposes
The following table presents pre-tax gains/(losses)
recorded on a limited number of derivatives, not
designated in hedge accounting relationships, that are
used to manage risks associated with certain specified
assets and liabilities, including certain risks
arising from mortgage commitments, warehouse loans,
MSRs, wholesale lending exposures, and foreign
currency-denominated assets and liabilities.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives
used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in
mortgage commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as
well as written commitments to originate warehouse
loans. Gains and losses were recorded predominantly in
mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate
credit risk associated with lending exposures in the
Firm’s wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not
include credit derivatives used to mitigate
counterparty credit risk arising from derivative
receivables, which is included in gains and losses on
derivatives related to market-making activities and
other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in
principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate
foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses
were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 6 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives
Refer to Note 5 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.
(b) Represents Other protection purchased by CIB, primarily in its market-making businesses.
(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.
(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.
(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.
The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, where JPMorgan Chase is the seller of
protection. The maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts.
The ratings profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is
based. The ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorgan Chase is the purchaser of protection
are comparable to the profile reflected below.

Principal transactions
The following table presents all realized and
unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal
transactions revenue. This table excludes interest

representative of the total revenue of any individual
LOB.

FDIC Special Assessment

In May 2023, the FDIC issued a notice of proposed
rulemaking recommending a special assessment related
to the systemic risk determination made on March 12,
2023, to recover losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund
("DIF") arising from the protection of uninsured
depositors resulting from recent bank resolutions. In
its current form, the rule would impose a special
assessment at an annual rate of 12.5 basis points on
certain banks’ estimated uninsured deposits reported
as of December 31, 2022. The Firm expects to be
subject to the special assessment as proposed by the
FDIC.

Investment securities consist of debt securities that are classified as AFS or HTM. Debt securities classified as
trading assets are discussed in Note 2. Predominantly all of the Firm’s AFS and HTM securities are held by Treasury
and CIO in connection with its asset-liability management activities. At September 30, 2023, the investment
securities portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings
where available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Effective January 1, 2023,
the Firm adopted the portfolio layer method hedge accounting guidance which permitted a transfer of HTM securities
to AFS upon adoption. The Firm transferred obligations of U.S. states and municipalities with a carrying value of $
7.1billion resulting in the recognition of $ 38million net pre-tax unrealized losses in AOCI. This transfer was a
noncash transaction. Refer to Note 1 and Note 21 for additional information. During 2022, the Firm transferred $
78.3billion of investment securities from AFS to HTM for capital management purposes. AOCI included pretax
unrealized losses of $ 4.8billion on the securities at the date of transfer. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio.
The amortized costs and estimated fair values of the investment securities portfolio were as follows for the dates
indicated.

2022, respectively. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the three
and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further
discussion of accounting policies for accrued interest receivable on investment securities.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and
U.S. GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 9.7billion and $ 9.6billion, at September 30, 2023
and December 31, 2022, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in
interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by
the U.S. government.

HTM securities – credit risk Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM
securities is the risk rating assigned to each
security. At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
all HTM securities were rated investment grade and
were current and accruing, with approximately 99% and
98% rated at least AA+, respectively.

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities was $ 117million and $ 61million as of
September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, which
included a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained
earnings related to the transfer of HTM securities to
AFS for the nine months ended September 30, 2023.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio
hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal
prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield
is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for
credit losses of $( 30) million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $( 2.9) billion at
September 30, 2023. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses
of $( 87) million at September 30, 2023.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, seven yearsfor agency residential
collateralized mortgage obligations, and six yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.
(d) Includes AFS securities associated with First Republic, primarily due after 10 years. Refer to Note 28 for
additional information.

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which
the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 25 for further information regarding assets pledged and
collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the
Firm’s securities financing agreements as of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. When the Firm has obtained
an appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other
relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”
presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-
for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities
within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the Firm held $ 541million and $ 692million of financial assets for
which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a sale in
accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions. The
transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded
primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

On January 1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments - Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings and
Vintage Disclosures accounting guidance as discussed in Note 1. The adoption of this guidance eliminated the
existing accounting and disclosure requirements for TDRs, and implemented additional disclosure requirements for
FDMs. The disclosure requirements for FDMs are effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023. Refer
to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion on loan modifications prior to January 1,
2023, which were accounted for and reported as TDRs. This new guidance also requires disclosure of current period
gross charge-offs by vintage origination year, effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2023.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

(c) Includes loans held in CIB, CB, AWM, Corporate as well as risk-rated BWM and auto dealer loans held in CCB, for

(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory
agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, states and political subdivisions, SPEs, nonprofits, personal
investment companies and trusts, as well as loans to individuals and individual entities (predominantly Global
Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within CCB). Refer to Note 14 of JPMorgan Chase’s
2022 Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were
not material at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022

(b) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic which are still within their deferral period and performing according to their modified terms are
generally not considered delinquent.

(c) Included $ 6.1billion, $ 26.5billion, $ 22.2billion, $ 15.0billion, $ 7.5billion, and $ 11.3billion of term
loans originated in 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 and prior to 2019, respectively, and $ 2.5billion of revolving
loans within the revolving period associated with First Republic.

(d) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not
material at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee.

(e) Included $ 165million of 30+ days past due loans associated with First Republic.

(f) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 37% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At September 30, 2023,
approximately 10% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 44million and $ 42million and $ 133million
and $ 132million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

(e) Generally excludes loans under payment deferral programs offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

(f) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(g) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(h) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at September 30, 2023.

(k) Prior-period amounts have been revised to conform with the current presentation.

(l) Included $ 2.6billion in equal to or greater than 660 FICO scores within 80% to 100% LTV ratio, and $
86.3billion and $ 1.7billion in equal to or greater than 660 and less than 660 FICO scores, respectively, within
less than 80% LTV ratio associated with First Republic.

(m) Included $ 91.2billion of loans associated with First Republic.

(n) Included $ 55.2billion, $ 15.0billion, $ 3.6billion and $ 7.9billion in California, New York, Florida and
Massachusetts, respectively, associated with First Republic.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of residential real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty, which effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. The Firm's proprietary modification programs as
well as government programs, including U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various modifications to borrowers
experiencing financial difficulty including, but not limited to, interest rate reductions, term extensions, other-
than-insignificant payment delay and principal forgiveness that would otherwise have been required under the terms
of the original agreement, are considered FDMs. Financial effects of FDMs For the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs were $ 43million and $ 110million, respectively. The financial
effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the form of term extensions and interest rate reductions, included
extending the weighted-average life of the loans by 22years and 19years, and reducing the weighted-average
contractual interest rate from 7.22% to 4.63% and 7.04% to 4.24% for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, respectively. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, there were noadditional commitments to
lend to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as FDMs. In addition to FDMs,
the Firm also had $ 27million and $ 59million of loans subject to a trial modification, and $ 3million and $
7million of Chapter 7 loans for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, respectively. The changes to
the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR reasonably expected and concession assessment criteria. Accordingly,
trial modifications and Chapter 7 loans were considered TDRs, but not FDMs. Payment status of FDMs and redefaults
For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, residential real estate FDMs of $ 6million and $ 20million,
respectively, were 30 or more days past due. For both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2023, FDMs that
re-defaulted were not material. Nature and extent of TDRs For periods ending prior to January 1, 2023,
modifications of residential real estate loans where the Firm granted concessions to borrowers who were
experiencing financial difficulty were generally accounted for and reported as TDRs. For the three and nine months
ended September 30, 2022, new TDRs were $ 80million and $ 313million, respectively. There were no additional
commitments to lend to borrowers whose residential real estate loans have been modified in TDRs. Refer to Note 12
of JPMorgan Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for further information on TDRs.
The following table provides information about how
residential real estate loans were modified in TDRs

permanent modifications.

(a) At September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
nonaccrual loans excluded $ 35million and $
101million, respectively, of PPP loans 90 or more days
past due and guaranteed by the SBA, of which $
33million and $ 76million, respectively, were no
longer accruing interest based on the guidelines set
by the SBA. Typically the principal balance of the
loans is insured and interest is guaranteed at a
specified reimbursement rate subject to meeting the
guidelines set by the SBA. There were noloans that
were not guaranteed by the SBA that are 90 or more
days past due and still accruing interest at September
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022.

(b) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an
allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance,
certain nonaccrual loans that are considered
collateral-dependent have been charged down to the
lower of amortized cost or the fair value of their
underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value
of the underlying collateral improves subsequent to
charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(c) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on
a cash basis was not material for the three and nine
months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022 .

(d) The geographic regions presented in this table are
ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding
loan balances at September 30, 2023.

auto and other FDMs were not material and there were
noadditional commitments to lend to borrowers modified

30, 2022, auto and other TDRs were not material.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty, which
effective January 1, 2023, are reported as FDMs. These modifications involve placing the customer on a fixed
payment plan, generally for 60months, and typically include reducing the interest rate on the credit card under
long-term programs. If the cardholder does not comply with the modified payment terms, then the credit card loan
continues to age and will ultimately be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In
most cases, the Firm does not reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

Financial effects of FDMs
The following tables provide information on credit card loan modifications considered FDMs.

For both the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023, the Firm also had $ 29million of credit card
loans subject to trial modifications. The changes to
the TDR accounting guidance eliminated the TDR
reasonably expected and concession assessment
criteria. A ccordingly, trial modifications are not
considered FDMs.

There were $ 18million and $ 24million FDMs that re-
defaulted during both the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 which were a combination of term
extension and interest rate reduction. For credit card
loans modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to
have occurred when the borrower misses twoconsecutive
contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card
loans remain in the modification program and continue
to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's
standard charge-off policy.

Financial effects of TDRs and redefaults For periods
ending prior to January 1, 2023, modifications of
credit card loans where the Firm granted concessions
to borrowers who were experiencing financial
difficulty were generally accounted for and reported
as TDRs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase's 2022
Form 10-K for further information on TDRs.

The following table provides information about the
financial effects of the concessions granted on credit
card loans modified in TDRs and redefaults. New
enrollments were less than 1% of total retained credit
card loans.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients,
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further

(a) Represents FDMs that were 30 days or more past due.
Additional unfunded commitments to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose Commercial and industrial
loans have been modified as FDMs were $ 363million and $ 1.5billion for the three and nine months ended September
30, 2023, and additional unfunded commitments to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose Secured by real
estate and Other loans have been modified as FDMs were $ 1million for the three and nine months ended September 30,
2023. Nature and extent of TDRs Prior to January 1, 2023, certain loan modifications were considered TDRs. For the
three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, new TDRs were $ 108million and $ 587million, respectively. New TDRs
for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 reflected extended maturity dates and covenant waivers
primarily in the Commercial and Industrial loan class. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, the
impact of these modifications were not material to the Firm. As a result of the elimination of the requirement to
assess whether a modification is reasonably expected or involves a concession, the population of loans considered
FDMs is greater than the population previously considered TDRs.

  Note 13 – Allowance for credit losses                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
The Firm's allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. On January
1, 2023 the Firm adopted the Financial Instruments -
Credit Losses: Troubled Debt Restructurings accounting
guidance as described in Note 1. The adoption of this
guidance eliminated the requirement to measure the
allowance for TDRs using a DCF methodology and allowed
the option of a non-DCF portfolio-based approach for
modified loans to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty. If a DCF methodology is still applied for
these modified loans, the discount rate must be the
post-modification effective interest rate, instead of
the pre-modification effective interest rate. The Firm
elected to change from an asset-specific allowance
approach to its non-DCF, portfolio-based allowance
approach for modified loans to troubled borrowers for
all portfolios except collateral-dependent loans and
nonaccrual risk-rated loans, for which the asset-
specific allowance approach will continue to apply.
This guidance was adopted under the modified
retrospective method which resulted in a net decrease
to the allowance for credit losses of $ 587million and
an increase to retained earnings of $ 446million,
after-tax predominantly driven by residential real
estate and credit card. Refer to Note 13 of JPMorgan
Chase's 2022 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of
the allowance for credit losses and the related
accounting policies.

(b) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm
also had an allowance for credit losses of $ 17million and $ 30million, respectively, associated with certain
accounts receivable in CIB.

(e) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(f) At September 30, 2023 and 2022, lending-related commitments excluded $ 18.1billion and $ 12.6billion,
respectively, for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 898.9billion and $ 798.9billion,
respectively, for the credit card portfolio segment; and $ 16.2billion and $ 20.0billion, respectively, for the
wholesale portfolio segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments. Prior period
amount for wholesale lending-related commitments, including the amount not subject to allowance, has been revised
to conform with the current presentation.

Discussion of changes in the allowance

The allowance for credit losses as of September 30, 2023 was $ 24.2billion, reflecting a net addition of $
2.5billion from December 31, 2022. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses included $ 1.4billion,
consisting of: • $ 707million in consumer , predominantly driven by CCB, comprised of $ 801million in Card
Services, partially offset by a $ 200million net reduction in Home Lending. The net addition in Card Services was
driven by loan growth, including an increase in revolving balances, partially offset by reduced borrower
uncertainty and the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook. The net reduction
in Home Lending was largely driven by improvements in the outlook for home prices, and • $ 623million in wholesale
, driven by net downgrade activity, the net effect of changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook,
including deterioration in the outlook for commercial real estate in CB, partially offset by the impact of changes
in the loan and lending-related commitment portfolios in CIB in the third quarter of 2023. The net addition also
included $ 1.2billion to establish the allowance for the First Republic loans and lending-related commitments in
the second quarter of 2023. The changes in the Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook included updates to
the central scenario in the third quarter of 2023 to reflect a lower forecasted unemployment rate consistent with a
higher growth rate in GDP. The Firm's weighted average macroeconomic outlook also reflects the impact of the
additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios in the first quarter of 2023, reflecting elevated recession risks
due to high inflation and tightening financial conditions. The allowance for credit losses also reflected a
reduction of $ 587million as a result of the adoption of changes to the TDR accounting guidance on January 1, 2023.
Refer to Note 1 for further information. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted
average of five internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case assumptions provided in the table below, resulting in a weighted
average U.S. unemployment rate peaking at 5.5% in the fourth quarter of 2024, and a 1.8% lower U.S. real GDP
exiting the fourth quarter of 2024.
The Firm’s central case assumptions reflected U.S.
unemployment rates and U.S. real GDP as follows:

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs

Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the Firm is considered to be the
primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase Issuance Trust. Firm-
sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized) originated and
purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB and CIB
businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm may act
as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        165                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests.

As of September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, the

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of
business, JPMorgan Chase makes markets in and invests
in commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 8.7billion and
$ 13.8billion of the commercial paper issued by the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at September
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, which
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s
investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs and
capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity.
Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated
under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper
issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits.
Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide
liquidity and credit enhancement provided by the Firm
have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits provide
lending-related commitments to certain clients of the
Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The unfunded
commitments were $ 9.9billion and $ 10.6billion at
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet
lending-related commitments in other unfunded
commitments to extend credit. Refer to Note 24 for
more information on off-balance sheet lending-related
commitments. Municipal bond vehicles Municipal bond
vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow
institutions to finance their municipal bond
investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are
known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer TOB
trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third
party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer
TOB transactions.

(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.
(b) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(c) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(d) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the
Consolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial
interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorgan Chase. Included in beneficial interests
in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 3.2billion and $ 2.1billion at September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022, respectively.
(e) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(f) Primarily includes purchased supply chain finance receivables and purchased auto loan securitizations in CIB.
VIEs sponsored by third parties

The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These include, for example, acting as a
derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement agent, remarketing agent, trustee or
custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual credit decisions are based on the
analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the underlying assets. Where the Firm does
not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s economic
performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant, the Firm generally does not consolidate
the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated balance sheets in the same manner it would
record and report positions in respect of any other third-party transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds
investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are limited partnerships and similar entities that own and
operate affordable housing, energy, and other projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party
is typically the general partner or managing member and has control over the significant activities of the tax
credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in
these partnerships as a limited partner and earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated
to the projects. The maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $
32.5billion and $ 30.2billion at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, of which $ 12.7billion and $ 10.6billion
was unfunded at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to
reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax
credits. Refer to Note 25 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for further information on affordable housing tax
credits and Note 24 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments.
                                                        168                                                        
Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions, the Firm,
as liquidity provider, has entered into a reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In those transactions,
upon the termination of the vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party Residual holders for any shortfall.
The Firm does not have any intent to protect Residual holders from potential losses on any of the underlying
municipal bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s maximum
exposure as a liquidity provider to customer TOB trusts at September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022 was $
5.5billion and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair value of assets held by such VIEs at September 30, 2023 and
December 31, 2022 was $ 7.2billion and $ 8.2billion, respectively. Loan securitizations The Firm has securitized
and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables, commercial mortgages and
other consumer loans.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored

enterprises and loans in securitization transactions pursuant to

Ginnie Mae guidelines

In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above, the Firm, in the normal course of
business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis,
predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for the purpose of securitization by the
U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement of the loans). The Firm also sells
loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these loans are typically insured or
guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the securitization vehicles underlying
these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of loan sales, the Firm is obligated
to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the purchaser. Refer to Note 24 of this
Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications and
Note 15 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale of certain excess MSRs.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to
the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due
to material breaches of representations and warranties
as discussed in Note 24, the Firm also has the option
to repurchase delinquent loans that it services for
Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S.
government

agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm
typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from
Ginnie Mae loan pools as it continues to service them
and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance
with the applicable requirements, and such loans
continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s
repurchase option becomes exercisable, such loans must
be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a
loan with a corresponding liability. Refer to Note 12
for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2023
and December 31, 2022. Substantially all of these
loans and real estate are insured or guaranteed by
U.S. government agencies.

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the accounting policies related to
goodwill and mortgage servicing rights. Goodwill
Goodwill is recorded upon completion of a business
combination as the difference between the purchase
price and the fair value of the net assets acquired,
and can be adjusted up to one year from the
acquisition date as more information pertaining to
facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date is obtained about the fair value of
assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
The following table presents goodwill attributed to the reportable business segments and Corporate.

(a) For the three months ended September 30, 2023, represents an adjustment to goodwill related to the acquisition
of CIFM in AWM. For the nine months ended September 30, 2023, represents estimated goodwill associated with the
acquisition of Aumni Inc. in CIB in the second quarter, and the acquisition of the remaining 51% interest in CIFM
in AWM in the first quarter. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022, represents estimated goodwill
associated with the acquisitions of Global Shares PLC in AWM and Figg, Inc. in CCB in the third quarter, and Frosch
Travel Group, LLC in CCB and Volkswagen Payments S.A. in CIB in the second quarter.
(b) Predominantly foreign currency adjustments.
Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for
impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal
year, or more often if events or circumstances, such
as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate
that there may be an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of the Firm’s goodwill impairment testing.
Unanticipated declines in business performance,
increases in credit losses, increases in capital
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or
market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of
equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the
Firm’s reporting units to decline in the future, which
could result in a material impairment charge to
earnings in a future period related to some portion of
the associated goodwill. As of September 30, 2023, the
Firm reviewed current economic conditions, estimated
market cost of equity, as well as actual business
results and projections of business performance. Based
on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill
was not impaired as of September 30, 2023, or December
31, 2022, nor was goodwill written off due to
impairment during the nine months ended September 30,
2023 or 2022.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.

(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result
of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.
(b) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities
(“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the
Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.
(c) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(d) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(e) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022, and outlines
hypothetical sensitivities of those fair values to

effects of the associated derivative instruments used in hedge accounting relationships, if applicable. The
interest rates shown exclude structured notes accounted for at fair value.

(g) As of September 30, 2023, included $ 23.9billion of FHLB advances associated with First Republic. Refer to Note
28 for additional information.

(h) As of September 30, 2023 , long-term debt in the aggregate of $ 189.0billion was redeemable at the option of
JPMorgan Chase, in whole or in part, prior to maturity, based on the terms specified in the respective instruments.

(i) The aggregate carrying values of debt that matures in each of the 12-month periods ending September 30, 2024,
2025, 2026, 2027 and 2028 is $ 45.3billion, $ 52.0billion, $ 40.8billion, $ 31.6billion and $ 75.4billion,
respectively.
                                                        175                                                        
The weighted-average contractual interest rates for
total long-term debt excluding structured notes
accounted for at fair value were 3.53% and 3.26% as of
September 30, 2023 and December 31, 2022,
respectively. In order to modify exposure to interest
rate and currency exchange rate movements, JPMorgan
Chase utilizes derivative instruments, primarily
interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps,
in conjunction with some of its debt issuances. The
use of these instruments modifies the Firm’s interest
expense on the associated debt. The modified weighted-
average interest rates for total long-term debt,
including the effects of related derivative
instruments, were 5.15% and 4.89% as of September 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. JPMorgan
Chase & Co. has guaranteed certain long-term debt of
its subsidiaries, including structured notes. These
guarantees rank pari passu with the Firm’s other
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The amount
of such guaranteed long-term debt and structured notes
was $ 36.9billion and $ 28.2billion at September 30,
2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively. The Firm’s
unsecured debt does not contain requirements that
would call for an acceleration of payments, maturities
or changes in the structure of the existing debt,
provide any limitations on future borrowings or
require additional collateral, based on unfavorable
changes in the Firm’s credit ratings, financial
ratios, earnings or stock price.

Note 23 – Regulatory capital

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for a detailed discussion on regulatory capital.

The Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized requirements, for the
consolidated financial holding company. The Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes
similar minimum capital requirements and standards for
the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase
Bank, N.A.

Under the risk-based capital and leverage-based
guidelines of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. IDI
subsidiaries are also subject to these capital
requirements established by their respective primary
regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios
to which the Firm and its IDI subsidiaries were
subject as of September 30, 2023 and December 31,
2022.

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition

Beginning January 1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL
capital benefit, provided by the Federal Reserve in
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is being phased out
at 25% per year over a three-year period. As of
September 30, 2023, the Firm's CET1 capital reflected
the remaining $ 1.4billion benefit associated with the
CECL capital transition provisions.

Similarly, as of January 1, 2023, the Firm has phased
out 50% of the other CECL capital transition
provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as
applicable.

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for further information on CECL capital transition
provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorgan Chase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 13 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at September
30, 2023 and December 31, 2022. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored
business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has
not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these products will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel credit card and certain scored business banking lines of credit by
providing the borrower notice or, in some cases as permitted by law, without notice. In addition, the Firm
typically closes credit card lines when the borrower is 60days or more past due. The Firm may reduce or close
HELOCs when there are significant decreases in the value of the underlying property, or when there has been a
demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 5 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the Firm's Merchant
Services business in CIB Payments, retains a contingent liability for disputed processed credit and debit card
transactions that result in a charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved in the cardholder’s favor, the
Firm will (through the cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount to the cardholder and will charge
back the transaction to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the amount from the merchant, the Firm will
bear the loss for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder. The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding
future settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm recognizes
a valuation allowance that covers the payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.
                                                        186                                                        
Loan sales and securitization-related indemnifications
In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with GSEs the Firm has made
representations and warranties that the loans sold
meet certain requirements, and that may require the
Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the
loan purchaser if such representations and warranties
are breached by the Firm. The liability related to
repurchase demands associated with private label
securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in
establishing its litigation reserves. Refer to Note 26
of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022
Form 10-K for additional information regarding
litigation. Sponsored member repo program The Firm
acts as a sponsoring member to clear eligible
overnight and term resale and repurchase agreements
through the Government Securities Division of the
Fixed Income Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf
of clients that become sponsored members under the
FICC’s rules. The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the
prompt and full payment and performance of its
sponsored member clients’ respective obligations under
the FICC’s rules. The Firm minimizes its liability
under these guarantees by obtaining a security
interest in the cash or high-quality securities
collateral that the clients place with the clearing
house therefore the Firm expects the risk of loss to
be remote. The Firm’s maximum possible exposure,
without taking into consideration the associated
collateral, is included in the Exchange & clearing
house guarantees and commitments line on page 185.
Refer to Note 11 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for additional information on credit risk mitigation
practices on resale agreements and the types of
collateral pledged under repurchase agreements.
Guarantees of subsidiaries The Parent Company has
guaranteed certain long-term debt and structured notes
of its subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase
Financial Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 185 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Note 25 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K
for a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.
The following table presents the Firm’s pledged

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.
The following table presents the fair value of
collateral accepted.

Contingencies

As of September 30, 2023, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
legal proceedings, including private, civil litigations, government investigations or regulatory enforcement
matters. The litigations range from individual actions involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with
potentially millions of class members. Investigations and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and
informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are
at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business
and several geographies and a wide variety of claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory
antitrust, securities and consumer protection claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm
believes the estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for
its legal proceedings is from $ 0to approximately $ 1.3billion at September 30, 2023. This estimated aggregate
range of reasonably possible losses was based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in
which the Firm believes that an estimate of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm
does not believe that such an estimate can be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses involves significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the
proceedings, including the fact that many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of
multiple defendants, including the Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous
yet-unresolved issues in many of the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of
many of the claims, and • the uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where
the Firm has made assumptions concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or
incentives of adverse parties or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition,
the outcome of a particular proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate
because the Firm had deemed the likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the
aggregate range of reasonably possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary
significantly. Set forth below are descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P.
Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia
Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest
assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and
2010, respectively, received from 1MDB and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan Suisse (SA) held by 1MDB PetroSaudi
Limited , a joint venture company between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In September 2022, the
Firm filed an application challenging the validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the
claim. In April 2023, 1MDB requested Court permission to discontinue its claim and re-file a new claim in the
future. In August 2023, the Court denied those requests and reinstated the claim. 1MDB and the Firm each filed
separate appeals of that decision in September 2023. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from
continuing. The Firm’s challenge to service and jurisdiction is scheduled for hearing in December 2023. Amrapali .
India’s Enforcement Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with
investments made in 2010 and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorgan Chase entities into residential
housing projects developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”). In 2017, numerous creditors filed civil claims
against Amrapali, including petitions brought by home buyers relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver
residential units. The home buyers’ petitions have been overseen by the Supreme Court of India and are ongoing. In
August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million. The Firm
is appealing the order and the fine. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making
preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorgan Chase entities and the
offshore funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordering the ED to conduct a further inquiry under India’s Prevention of Money Laundering Act
(“PMLA”) and Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”). In May 2020, the ED attached approximately $ 25million from
J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with the criminal PMLA investigation. The Firm is responding to and
cooperating with the PMLA investigation. Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously
reported settlements with certain government authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading
activities and controls related to those activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty
to a single violation of federal antitrust law. The
                                                        188                                                        
Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates to continue to rely
on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”)
through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining FX-related
governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before the South
Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, in August 2018, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York granted final approval to the Firm’s settlement of a consolidated class
action brought by U.S.-based plaintiffs, which principally alleged violations of federal antitrust laws based on an
alleged conspiracy to manipulate foreign exchange rates and also sought damages on behalf of persons who transacted
in FX futures and options on futures. Although certain members of the settlement class filed requests to the Court
to be excluded from the class, an agreement to resolve their claims was reached in December 2022. In a separate
putative class action filed against the Firm and other foreign exchange dealers on behalf of certain parties who
purchased foreign currencies at allegedly inflated rates, the District Court denied certification of a class and
granted summary judgment against the named plaintiffs in March 2023. An appeal by those plaintiffs of the District
Court's decision is pending. In addition, some FX-related individual and putative class actions based on similar
alleged underlying conduct have been filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil
and Australia. An agreement to resolve one of the UK actions was reached in December 2022. In July 2023, the U.K.
Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a request for class certification on
an opt-out basis. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached in the putative class action, which remains
subject to court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed a series of
class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set the price of
credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In 2012, the
parties initially settled the cases for a cash payment, but that settlement was reversed on appeal and remanded to
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York. The original class action was divided into
twoseparate actions, one seeking primarily monetary relief and the other seeking primarily injunctive relief. In
September 2018, the parties to the monetary class action finalized an agreement which amends and supersedes the
prior settlement agreement. Pursuant to this settlement, the defendants collectively contributed an additional $
900million to the approximately $ 5.3billion previously held in escrow from the original settlement. In December
2019, the amended settlement agreement was approved by the District Court. In March 2023, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court’s approval of the settlement, and that settlement is
now final. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the amended class settlement, $ 700million has
been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow in accordance with the settlement agreement. The
injunctive class action continues separately, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion
for class certification in part, and denied the motion in part. Of the merchants who opted out of the amended
damages class settlement, certain merchants filed individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and
Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants
have reached settlements with the merchants who opted out representing approximately 65% of the combined
Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. Jeffrey Epstein Litigation. JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A. was named as a defendant in twolawsuits filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
New York alleging that JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. knowingly facilitated Jeffrey Epstein’s sex trafficking and other
unlawful conduct by providing banking services to Epstein until 2013. One case, which was filed in November 2022,
was a putative class action filed by an alleged sex-trafficking victim of Epstein, and the other case, which was
filed in December 2022, was brought on behalf of the government of the United States Virgin Islands. In March 2023,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. filed third-party complaints impleading the Firm’s former employee, James Edward Staley,
into the twolawsuits, asserting claims for indemnification, contribution, breach of fiduciary duty and violation of
the faithless servant doctrine. In June 2023, the Court granted the putative class’s motion for class certification
and granted a preliminary approval of a settlement between the class and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., pursuant to
which JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. paid $ 290million to a fund for Epstein survivors. The final settlement approval
hearing is scheduled for November 9, 2023, and in connection with the hearing, certain state Attorneys General have
sought to object to the victims’ releases. In September 2023, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. reached a settlement
totaling $ 75million with the government of the United States Virgin Islands and separately reached an agreement
with Staley to resolve JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.’s affirmative claims against him, the terms of which are
confidential. LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation. JPMorgan Chase has responded to
inquiries from various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British
Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European
Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation
relating to EURIBOR, to which the Firm and one other bank remain subject, continues. In December 2016, the European
                                                        189                                                        
Commission issued a decision against the Firm and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules
relating to EURIBOR. The Firm has filed an appeal of that decision with the European General Court, and that appeal
is pending. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and
putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar
LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and
resolved certain other actions, and others are in various stages of litigation. The United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York has granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and
interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. A consolidated putative class action
related to the period that U.S. dollar LIBOR was administered by ICE Benchmark Administration has been dismissed.
In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm
and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023. The Firm’s settlements of
putative class actions related to the Singapore Interbank Offered Rate and the Singapore Swap Offer Rate, and the
Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate received final court approval in November 2022, and the settlement related
to Swiss franc LIBOR received final court approval in September 2023. SEC Inquiries . The Firm is responding to
requests from the SEC regarding aspects of certain advisory programs within J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, including
aggregation of accounts for billing, discounting advisory fees, and selecting portfolio managers. Separately, the
Firm is responding to requests from the SEC in connection with the timing of the Firm’s liquidation of shares
distributed in-kind to certain investment vehicles that invest in third-party managed private funds. The Firm is
cooperating with the SEC in regard to both inquires. Securities Lending Antitrust Litigation . JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, J.P. Morgan Prime, Inc., and J.P. Morgan Strategic Securities Lending Corp. are
named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York. The complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and New York State common law in connection
with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending
transactions. The settlement of this action by the parties has been preliminarily approved, and is subject to final
court approval. Shareholder Litigation . Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder
derivative actions purporting to act on behalf of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of
Directors and certain of its current and former officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical
trading practices by former employees in the precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which
were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities
that were separately the subject of a resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020.
One of these shareholder derivative suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022,
asserting breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and
related conduct and fiduciary activities which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December
2022, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss this action in full, and in July 2023, the plaintiff filed an
appeal, which remains pending. A second shareholder derivative action was filed in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022 relating to the historical trading practices and related
conduct, which asserts breach of fiduciary duty and contribution claims and alleges that the shareholder is excused
from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand would have been futile. Defendants have moved to
dismiss the complaint. In addition, a consolidated putative class action is pending in the United States District
Court for the Eastern District of New York on behalf of shareholders who acquired shares of JPMorgan Chase common
stock during the putative class period, alleging that certain SEC filings of the Firm were materially false or
misleading because they did not disclose certain information relating to the historical trading practices and
conduct. Defendants have moved to dismiss the amended complaint in this action. A separate shareholder derivative
suit was filed in March 2022 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York asserting
breaches of fiduciary duty and violations of federal securities laws based on the alleged failure of the Board of
Directors to exercise adequate oversight over the Firm’s compliance with records preservation requirements which
were the subject of resolutions between certain of the Firm’s subsidiaries and the SEC and the CFTC. Defendants’
motion to dismiss the amended complaint is pending. Twoshareholder derivative suits were filed in May and June
2023, respectively, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York asserting breaches of
fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on the alleged failure of the Board of Directors and James Dimon to
exercise adequate oversight with respect to the Firm’s provision of banking services to Jeffrey Epstein. These
actions allege that the shareholders are excused from making a demand to commence litigation because such a demand
would have been futile. These actions were consolidated, and in August 2023, the Court dismissed the consolidated
action.
                                                        190                                                        
Trading Venues Investigations . The Firm has been responding to government inquiries regarding its processes to
inventory trading venues and confirm the completeness of certain data fed to trade surveillance platforms. The Firm
is cooperating with these inquiries, has undertaken corrective actions and is committed to taking appropriate steps
to remedy the deficiencies identified. Certain U.S. regulators have proposed resolving their inquiries through,
among other things, the payment of a civil money penalty. The Firm is currently engaged in resolution discussions
with those U.S. regulators and is considering potential implications of those resolutions. There is no assurance
that such discussions will result in a resolution. * * * In addition to the various legal proceedings discussed
above, JPMorgan Chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial
number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it
in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously. Additional legal
proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves for several hundred
of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP for contingencies,
the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and
the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each
quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or downward, as
appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal expense was $
665million and $ 47million for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. There is no
assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the inherent
difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very large or
indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of parties or are
in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the
currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines, penalties or
consequences related to those matters. JPMorgan Chase believes, based upon its current knowledge and after
consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into
account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other legal
proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated
financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings,
there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it
has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome
of a particular matter may be material to JPMorgan Chase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on,
among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorgan Chase’s income for that
period.

  Note 27 – Business segments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are fourmajor reportable business segments - Consumer & Community
Banking, Corporate & Investment Bank, Commercial Banking and Asset & Wealth Management. In addition, there is a
Corporate segment. The business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which financial information is currently evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee. Segment results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to Segment results below, and Note 32
of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a further discussion of JPMorgan Chase’s business segments. Segment results
The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and 2022, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with the reported
U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm (and each of the
reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and
tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s managed
basis. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each business segment is referred to as equity. At
least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are reassessed and, as a
result, the capital allocated to the LOBs may change. In the second quarter of 2023, the Firm updated its line of

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services
revenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) In the first quarter of 2023, the allocations of revenue and expense to CCB associated with a Merchant Services
revenue sharing agreement were discontinued and are now retained in Payments in CIB. Prior-period amounts have been
revised to conform with the current presentation.

On May 1, 2023, JPMorgan Chase acquired certain assets
and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank
(the "First Republic acquisition") from the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), as receiver.
The Firm believes that the First Republic acquisition
is complementary to the Firm's existing franchises.
The acquisition resulted in an estimated bargain
purchase gain, which represents the excess of the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired above
the purchase price. The Firm has determined that this
acquisition constitutes a business combination under
U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the initial recognition of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed were generally
measured at their estimated fair values as of May 1,
2023. The determination of those fair values required
management to make certain market-based assumptions
about expected future cash flows, discount rates and
other valuation inputs at the time of the acquisition.
The Firm believes that the fair value estimates of the
assets acquired and liabilities assumed provide a
reasonable basis for determining the estimated bargain
purchase gain. The Firm and the FDIC have not yet
completed the settlement process under which the
purchase price, and the identification of the assets
acquired and liabilities assumed, will be finalized.
The finalization of this settlement process may impact
the amount of the estimated bargain purchase gain. The
purchase and assumption agreement entered into with
the FDIC allows for final settlement to occur up to a
year after the acquisition date. In addition, the
purchase price and the estimated bargain purchase gain
could change pending management's finalization of its
acquisition date fair value estimates for certain of
the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (such as
loans and commitments, intangible assets and leases),
which may take place up to one year from the
acquisition date, as permitted by U.S. GAAP. The First
Republic acquisition resulted in a preliminary
estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.7billion. The
Firm continues to progress in the settlement process
with the FDIC and refine its acquisition-date fair
value estimates. As a result, during the three months
ended September 30, 2023 , adjustments were made to
the fair value of the net assets acquired, increasing
the estimated bargain purchase gain by $ 100million to
$ 2.8billion for the nine months ended September 30,
2023 . In connection with the First Republic
acquisition, the Firm and the FDIC entered into
twoshared-loss agreements with respect to certain
loans and lending-related commitments (the "shared-
loss assets"): the Commercial Shared-Loss Agreement
("CSLA") and the Single-Family Shared-Loss Agreement
(“SFSLA”). The CSLA covers 80% of credit losses, on a
pari passu basis, over 5years with a subsequent
3-yearrecovery period for certain acquired commercial
loans and other real estate exposure. The SFSLA covers
80% of credit losses, on a pari passu basis,

for 7years for certain acquired loans secured by
mortgages on real property or shares in cooperative
property constituting a primary residence. The
indemnification assets, which represent the fair value
of the CSLA and SFSLA on the acquisition date, are
reflected in the total assets acquired. As part of the
consideration paid, JPMorgan Chase issued a five-year,
$ 50billion secured note to the FDIC (the "Purchase
Money Note"). The Purchase Money Note bears interest
at a fixed rate of 3.4% and is secured by certain of
the acquired loans. The Purchase Money Note is
prepayable upon notice to the holder. The Firm had
placed a $ 5billion deposit with First Republic Bank
on March 16, 2023, as part of $ 30billion of deposits
provided by a consortium of large U.S. banks. The
Firm's $ 5billion deposit was effectively settled as
part of the acquisition and the associated allowance
for credit losses was released upon closing. The Firm
subsequently repaid the remaining $ 25billion of
deposits to the consortium of banks, including accrued
interest through the payment date on May 9, 2023.

The computation of the purchase price, the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as
part of the First Republic acquisition and the related estimated bargain purchase gain are presented below, and
reflect the adjustments made during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the acquisition-date fair value of
the net assets acquired.

The issuance of the $ 50billion Purchase Money Note, the effective settlement of the Firm's $ 5billion deposit and
$ 447million of securities financing with First Republic Bank, and the $ 3.6billion payable to the FDIC as part of
the purchase price consideration are considered non-cash transactions.

The following describes the accounting policies and fair value methodologies generally used by the Firm for the
following assets acquired and liabilities assumed: core deposit and customer relationship intangibles, shared-loss
agreements and the related indemnification assets, Purchase Money Note, and FHLB advances.

Refer to JPMorgan Chase’s 2022 Form 10-K for a discussion of the Firm’s accounting policies and valuation
methodologies for securities, loans, deposits, and lending-related commitments.

Core deposit and customer relationship intangibles Core deposit and certain wealth management customer relationship
intangibles were acquired as part of the First Republic acquisition. The core deposit intangible of $ 1.3billion
was valued by discounting estimated after-tax cost savings over the remaining useful life of the deposits using the
favorable source of funds method. The after-tax cost savings were estimated based on the difference between the
cost of maintaining the core deposit base relative to the cost of next best alternative funding sources available
to market participants. The customer relationship intangibles of $ 180million were valued by discounting estimated
after-tax earnings over their remaining useful lives using the multi-period excess earnings method. Both intangible
asset valuations utilized assumptions that the Firm believes a market participant would use to estimate fair
values, such as growth and attrition rates, projected fee income as well as related costs to service the
relationships, and discount rates. The core deposit and customer relationship intangibles will be amortized over a
projected period of future cash flows of approximately 7years. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying values of the
core deposit and customer relationship intangibles were $ 1.2billion and $ 169million, respectively, reflecting
accumulated amortization of approximately $ 76million and $ 11million, respectively. Indemnification assets -
Shared-loss agreements The indemnification assets represent forecasted recoveries from the FDIC associated with the
shared-loss assets over the respective shared-loss recovery periods. The indemnification assets were recorded at
fair value in other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets on the
                                                        195                                                        
acquisition date. The fair values of the indemnification assets were estimated based on the timing of the
forecasted losses underlying the related allowance for credit losses. The subsequent quarterly remeasurement of the
indemnification assets is based on changes in the amount and timing of forecasted losses in the allowance for
credit losses associated with the shared-loss assets and is recorded in other income. Under certain circumstances,
the Firm may be required to make a payment to the FDIC upon termination of the shared-loss agreements based on the
level of actual losses and recoveries on the shared-loss assets. The estimated potential future payment is
reflected as contingent consideration as part of the purchase price consideration. Purchase Money Note and FHLB
advances The Purchase Money Note is recorded in long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets. The fair value
of the Purchase Money Note was estimated based on a discounted cash flow methodology and incorporated estimated
market discount rates. The FHLB advances assumed in the acquisition are recorded in short-term borrowings and in
long-term debt. The fair values of the FHLB advances were based on a discounted cash flow methodology and
considered the observed FHLB advance issuance rates.

as of May 1, 2023, and reflects adjustments made during the three months ended September 30, 2023 to the
acquisition-date fair value of the loans acquired.

Unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial information

Included in the Firm's Consolidated statements of income are noninterest revenue, net interest income and net
income contributed by First Republic of $ 761million, $ 1.5billion and $ 1.1billion, respectively, for the three
months ended September 30, 2023 and $ 3.9billion, $ 2.4billion and $ 3.5billion, respectively, for the nine months
ended September 30, 2023.
The following table presents certain unaudited pro forma financial information for the three and nine months ended
September 30, 2023 and 2022 as if the First Republic acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2022, including
recognition of the estimated bargain purchase gain of $ 2.8billion and the provision for credit losses of $
1.2billion. Additional adjustments include the interest on the Purchase Money Note and the impact of amortizing and
accreting certain estimated fair value adjustments related to intangible assets, loans and lending-related
commitments.
The Firm expects to achieve operating cost savings and other business synergies resulting from the acquisition that
are not reflected in the pro forma amounts. The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the
historical results of operations had the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2022, nor is it indicative of the
results of operations in future periods, particularly in light of recent changes in market and economic conditions.

We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of September 30, 2023, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
three-month and nine-month periods ended September 30,
2023 and 2022 and the consolidated statements of cash
flows for the nine-month periods ended September 30,
2023 and 2022, including the related notes
(collectively referred to as the “interim financial
statements”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware
of any material modifications that should be made to
the accompanying interim financial statements for them
to be in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2022, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein),
and in our report dated February 21, 2023, which
included a paragraph describing a change in the manner
of accounting for credit losses on certain financial
instruments in 2020, we expressed an unqualified
opinion on those consolidated financial statements. In
our opinion, the information set forth in the
accompanying consolidated balance sheet information as
of December 31, 2022, is fairly stated, in all
material respects, in relation to the consolidated
balance sheet from which it has been derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

the appraised value of the collateral (i.e.,
residential real estate) securing the loan.
                                                                                                                   
  Origination date LTV ratio                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.
                                                                                                                   
  Current estimated LTV ratio                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.

positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest
                                                        202                                                        
accrued in the prior month, and any unpaid interest is
deferred and added to the principal balance of the
loan. Option ARM loans are subject to payment recast,
which converts the loan to a variable-rate fully
amortizing loan upon meeting specified loan balance
and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards
programs generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate
for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and

interest has been in default for a period of 90 days
or more unless the loan is both well-secured and in
the process of collection. Collateral-dependent loans
are typically maintained on nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorgan Chase grants restricted stock and
RSUs to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant
deterioration in credit quality since origination, as

discipline through disclosure requirements which allow
market participants to assess the risk and capital
profiles of banks.

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in client-
driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven
market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities
(including physical commodities inventories and
financial instruments that reference commodities).
Principal transactions revenue also includes certain
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to
hedge accounting and specified risk-management
activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a

Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual
fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-
adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star
rating is the best rating and represents the top 10%
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked
funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents
the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star
rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom
10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average
of the performance associated with a fund’s three-,
five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating
metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star
ratings are provided at the individual share class
level. The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year
risk-adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than
three years of history are not rated and hence
excluded from these rankings. All ratings, the
                                                        207                                                        
assigned peer categories and the asset values used to
derive these rankings are sourced from the applicable
fund rating provider. Where applicable, the fund
rating providers redenominate asset values into U.S.
dollars. The percentage of AUM is based on star
ratings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled
funds, and at a “primary share class” level to
represent the star rating of all other funds, except
for Japan, for which Nomura provides ratings at the
fund level. The performance data may have been
different if all share classes had been included. Past
performance is not indicative of future results.

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd
quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile
rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset
values used to derive these rankings are sourced from
the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based
on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM
is based on fund performance and associated peer
rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled
funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent
the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong
Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all
share classes had been included. Past performance is
not indicative of future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.

│  Officer and its Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures (as    │

│  Deficiencies or lapses in internal controls may occur from time to time, and there can be no assurance that    │

│  the Firm acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of First Republic Bank from the FDIC. The     │
│  Firm has included internal controls over these acquired assets and assumed liabilities in its evaluation of    │
│  the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures. Otherwise, there was no change in the Firm’s          │

│  acquisition, or•an improved price for JPMorgan Chase’s common stock.Integration of an acquired business can    │
│  be complex and costly, and typically will involve the combination of relevant accounting and data processing   │
│  systems and management controls, as well as managing relevant relationships with employees, clients,           │
│  suppliers and other business partners. Integration efforts could divert management attention and resources,    │

│  efforts.Acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause JPMorgan Chase to lose clients and     │

Iran threat reduction disclosure

Pursuant to Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction
and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, which added
Section 13(r) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
an issuer is required to disclose in its annual or
quarterly reports, as applicable, whether it or any of
its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain
activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran
or with individuals or entities designated pursuant to
certain Executive Orders. Disclosure may be required
even where the activities, transactions or dealings
were conducted in compliance with applicable law.
Except as set forth below, as of the date of this
report, the Firm is not aware of any other activity,
transaction or dealing by any of its affiliates during
the quarter ended September 30, 2023 that requires
disclosure under Section 219.

A client of a fund distributor, who had invested the
equivalent of approximately USD 1,400 in a fund
managed by a non-US subsidiary of the Firm in
September 2023, was subsequently designated by the
Office of Foreign Assets Control as a Specially
Designated National under 31 C.F.R. Part 544.
Following the identification of this designation, the
client of the fund distributor fully redeemed their
investment in October 2023 for the equivalent of
approximately USD 1,400. The Firm did not receive a
transaction fee and calculates the management fee
attributable to this investment to be less than USD
0.01. The Firm does not intend to engage in such
transactions in the future.
