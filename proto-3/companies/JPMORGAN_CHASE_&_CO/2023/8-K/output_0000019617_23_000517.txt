Chairman & CEO Jamie Dimon confirmed today that he and his family plan to sell a portion of their holdings of
JPMorgan stock for financial diversification and tax-planning purposes. Starting in 2024 they currently intend to
sell 1 million shares, subject to the terms of a stock trading plan. This is Mr. Dimon’s first such stock sale
during his tenure at the company. Mr. Dimon continues to believe the company’s prospects are very strong and his
stake in the company will remain very significant. He and his family currently hold approximately 8.6 million
shares, and in addition he continues to have unvested Performance Share Units relating to 561,793 shares and Stock
Appreciation Rights relating to 1,500,000 shares, subject to the terms and conditions of each grant.

Mr. Dimon will use stock trading plans to sell his shares, in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule
10b5-1 of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934.
