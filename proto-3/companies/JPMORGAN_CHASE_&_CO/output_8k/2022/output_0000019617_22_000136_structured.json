              "content": "JPMorgan Chase & Co. (the “Firm”) announced that the independent members of the Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the total compensation for 2021 for Mr. James Dimon, CEO, in the amount of $34,500,000, compared to last year’s compensation of $31,500,000.",

                "compensation_breakdown": "Mr. Dimon’s total compensation includes an annual base salary of $1,500,000 and performance-based variable incentive compensation of $33,000,000. $5,000,000 of the variable incentive compensation will be delivered in cash and the remaining $28,000,000 will be delivered in the form of Performance Share Units ('PSUs'). The amounts of base salary and cash incentive remain unchanged from last year. The key features of the PSU program are also consistent with last year, including the financial metric (return on tangible common equity 1 - 'ROTCE') with absolute and relative performance goals, payout levels, vesting and hold requirements, as well as clawback and recovery provisions. 2",
                "determination_factors": "In determining Mr. Dimon's compensation, the independent members of the Board took into account the Firm's strong performance in 2021 and over the long term, across four broad dimensions: Business Results; Risk, Controls & Conduct; Client/Customer/Stakeholder; and Teamwork & Leadership.",
                "firm_performance_and_stewardship": "Amid the continued challenges of COVID-19 and supply chain disruptions, under Mr. Dimon's stewardship, the Firm continued to serve its clients and customers around the world during a time of unprecedented business demands, while supporting and providing a safe work environment for its employees and investing in and executing on strategic initiatives. In 2021, the Firm reported record revenue of $125.3 billion 1 and net income of $48.3 billion, or $15.36 per share, with ROTCE of 23%. The Firm increased its quarterly dividend from $0.90 to $1.00 per share and continued to reinforce its fortress balance sheet.",
                "financial_position_and_strategic_initiatives": "The Firm ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 13.0%, capital above $210 billion and $1.7 trillion of cash and marketable securities, providing it with meaningful capacity to support clients and further invest in its business and communities. During 2021, the Firm raised over $3 trillion 3 of credit and capital for its consumer and institutional clients around the world, which includes nonprofits and U.S. government entities, including states, municipalities, hospitals and universities. The Firm also improved its digital capabilities – for example, through its launch of the digital consumer business in the U.K., continued making acquisitions that will enhance its product offerings and deepen its engagement with its customers, and opened branches in new markets, becoming the first bank with branches in the contiguous 48 United States. The Firm continued to invest in its communities – for example, by making further progress on its longer-term commitment to advance racial equity and by continuing to drive inclusive economic growth.",

In addition to recapture provisions, portions of equity awards awarded to the CEO are also subject to additional Protection-based Vesting provisions under which awards may be cancelled as determined by the Compensation & Management Development Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by the Board of Directors. 3 Credit provided to clients represents new and renewed credit, including loans and commitments."
