              "content": "Effective June 1, 2024, JPMorgan Chase Financial Company LLC (“JPMorgan Financial”) became a direct subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase”) and all obligations owed to JPMorgan Financial by other subsidiaries of JPMorgan Chase under its intercompany agreements became obligations of JPMorgan Chase.",

                "Operational Dependence": "As a finance subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase, JPMorgan Financial has no independent operations beyond the issuance and administration of its securities and the collection of intercompany obligations. Aside from the initial capital contribution from JPMorgan Chase, substantially all of JPMorgan Financial’s assets relate to obligations of JPMorgan Chase to make payments under loans made to JPMorgan Chase by JPMorgan Financial or under other intercompany agreements. As a result, JPMorgan Financial is dependent upon payments from JPMorgan Chase to meet its obligations under its securities. If JPMorgan Chase does not make payments to JPMorgan Financial and JPMorgan Financial is unable to make payments on its securities, holders of JPMorgan Financial securities may have to seek payment under the related guarantee by JPMorgan Chase, and that guarantee will rank pari passu with all other unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of JPMorgan Chase."
