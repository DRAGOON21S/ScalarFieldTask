(“the Firm”) announced that Visa Inc. accepted the Firm’s tender of its 37.2 million shares of Visa Class B-1 common stock in exchange for a combination of Visa Class B-2 common stock and Visa Class C common stock. Visa’s acceptance has resulted in a gain for the Firm of approximately $8 billion relating to the Visa Class C common stock, which is held at fair value. The Visa Class B-2 common stock is held at the nominal carryover basis of the tendered Visa Class B-1 common stock. Refer to pages 8 and 100 of JPMorgan Chase’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2024 for further information.
