(a) As of January 1, 2025, the benefit from the CECL capital transition provision had been fully phased out. For
the period ended March 31, 2024, the ratios reflected the CECL capital transition provisions. Refer to Note 21 of
this Form 10-Q and Note 27 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information. (b) Reflects the Firm’s
ratios under the Basel III Standardized approach. Refer to Capital Risk Management on pages 33-39 for additional
information. (c) NII and NIR refer to net interest income and noninterest revenue, respectively. (d) Markets
consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets businesses. The Firm assesses the performance of its
Markets business on a total net revenue basis, as revenues in NII generally have offsets across other revenue
lines, primarily Principal transactions revenue.

First Republic-related gain: On January 17, 2025, the Firm reached an agreement with the FDIC with respect to
certain outstanding items related to the First Republic acquisition. As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a
payment of $609 million to the FDIC on January 31, 2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, which
resulted in a gain of $588 million recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 5 of this
Form 10-Q and Note 34 on pages 319-321 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information. Comparisons noted
in the sections below are for the first quarter of 2025 versus the first quarter of 2024, unless otherwise
specified. Firmwide overview For the first quarter of 2025, JPMorganChase reported net income of $14.6 billion, up
9%, earnings per share of $5.07, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 21%. The Firm's results included a $588 million First
Republic-related gain in Corporate. • Total net revenue was $45.3 billion, up 8%, reflecting: – Net interest income
("NII") of $23.3 billion, up 1%, driven by higher Markets net interest income, higher revolving balances in Card
Services, the impact of securities activity including from prior quarters, and higher wholesale deposit balances.
These factors were predominantly offset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as
lower average deposit balances in CCB. NII excluding Markets was $22.6 billion, down 2%. – Noninterest revenue
("NIR") was $22.0 billion, up 17%, predominantly driven by higher Markets noninterest revenue, a $588 million First
Republic-related gain, higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, lower net investment securities losses in
Treasury and CIO, and higher investment banking fees. • Noninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up 4%, driven by
higher compensation expense, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in the number of employees.
The increase in expense was also driven by higher brokerage expense and distribution fees, and continued
investments in technology and marketing, as well as the absence of a legal benefit from the prior year. These
factors were largely offset by the impact of an FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323 million compared
with an accrual increase of $725 million in the prior year. • The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion. Net
charge-offs were $2.3 billion, up $376 million, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting
                                                         5                                                         
the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years.
The net addition to the allowance for credit losses
was $973 million and included $549 million in
wholesale and $441 million in consumer , and was
largely driven by changes in the weighted-average
macroeconomic outlook.

In the prior year, the provision was $1.9 billion, net
charge-offs were $2.0 billion and the net reduction in
the allowance for credit losses was $72 million.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $27.8
billion at March 31, 2025 . The Firm had an allowance
for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of
1.94%, compared with 1.77% in the prior year.

Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 9-11 and
pages 12-13, respectively, for a further discussion of
the Firm's results, including the provision for credit
losses.

Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR
excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed
basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16 for a
further discussion of each of these measures.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.1 billion
at March 31, 2025 , up 10%, driven by higher wholesale
nonaccrual loans, largely in Real Estate, concentrated
in Multifamily and Lodging, reflecting downgrades,
partially offset by lower consumer nonaccrual loans,
which included loan sales. Refer to Wholesale Credit
Portfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52-60
and pages 49-51, respectively, for additional
information.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 2%,
predominantly driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up
2%, reflecting:

– net inflows in Payments and Securities Services, and

– growth in balances in new and existing client
accounts in AWM,

partially offset by

– a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in
balances in existing accounts due to migration into
higher-yielding investments and increased customer
spending.

These current expectations are forward-looking
statements within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such
forward-looking statements are based on the current
beliefs and expectations of JPMorganChase’s
management, speak only as of the date of this Form
10-Q, and are subject to significant risks and
uncertainties. Refer to Forward-Looking Statements on
page 77 of this Form 10-Q and Part I, Item 1A, Risk
Factors on pages 10–37 of the 2024 Form 10-K for a
further discussion of certain of those risks and
uncertainties and the other factors that could cause
JPMorganChase’s actual results to differ materially
because of those risks and uncertainties. There is no
assurance that actual results in 2025 will be in line
with the outlook information set forth below, and the
Firm does not undertake to update any forward-looking
statements.

JPMorganChase’s current outlook for full-year 2025
should be viewed against the backdrop of the global
and U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the
geopolitical environment, the competitive environment,
client and customer activity levels, and regulatory
and legislative developments in the U.S. and other
countries where the Firm does business. Each of these
factors will affect the performance of the Firm. The
Firm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to
its businesses and operations in response to ongoing
developments in the business, economic, regulatory and
legal environments in which it operates.

• Management expects net interest income to be
approximately $94.5 billion and net interest income
excluding Markets to be approximately $90.0 billion,
market dependent.

• Management expects adjusted expense to be
approximately $95.0 billion, market dependent.

• Management expects the net charge-off rate in Card
Services to be approximately 3.60%.

Net interest income excluding Markets and adjusted
expense are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to

In April 2025, a Texas federal district court granted
a joint request by the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau ("CFPB") and trade organizations to vacate the
CFPB Late Fee Rule. Also in April 2025, Congress
passed a resolution of disapproval overturning the
CFPB Overdraft Rule that is expected to be signed into
law by the President.

pages 2–7 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for

(a) Included operating lease income of $829 million and $672 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and
2024. Refer to Note 5 for additional information. Quarterly results Investment banking fees increased, reflecting
in CIB : • higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in
leveraged finance, and • higher advisory fees predominantly driven by the closing of deals announced in 2024,
partially offset by • lower equity underwriting fees as challenging market conditions resulted in lower fees. Refer
to CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue
increased, reflecting in CIB: • higher Equity Markets revenue, particularly in Equity Derivatives, and • higher
Fixed Income Markets revenue, reflecting higher revenue in Rates, predominantly offset by lower revenue in
Currencies & Emerging Markets, and Securitized Products. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has
offsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets
business on a total net revenue basis.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related
fees increased due to: • a reduction in client credits applied to deposit-related fees as well as increased volumes
resulting in higher cash management fees in Payments, partially offset by • a decline in the amortization of the
fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, primarily in
AWM, as certain of the commitments have expired. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 22-26 and pages
27-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management fees increased as a result of net
inflows in AWM and higher average market levels in AWM and CCB. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 19-21
and pages 27-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Commissions and other fees increased, largely
due to higher brokerage commissions and fees on higher volume, in both CIB and AWM. Refer to CIB and AWM segment
results on pages 22-26 and pages 27-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Investment securities
losses decreased, reflecting lower net losses compared to the prior year, which included sales of securities,
primarily U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment
securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate results on pages 30-31 and Note 9 for additional
information. Mortgage fees and related income : refer to Note 14 for additional information. Card income was flat,
reflecting, primarily in CCB, lower net interchange income and an increase in amortization related to new account
origination costs, offset by higher annual fees. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 19-21 and Note 5 for
additional information.
                                                         9                                                         
Other income increased, reflecting: • a $588 million First Republic-related gain in Corporate, and • higher auto
operating lease income due to an increase in origination volume in CCB. Refer to CCB and Corporate results on pages
19-21 and pages 30-31, respectively, for additional information; and Note 5 for additional information on the First
Republic-related gain. Net interest income increased driven by higher Markets net interest income, higher revolving
balances in Card Services, the impact of securities activity including from prior quarters, and higher wholesale
deposit balances. These factors were predominantly offset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin
compression, as well as lower average deposit balances in CCB. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.7
trillion, up $223 billion, and the yield was 5.19%, down 36 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on
an FTE basis, was 2.58%, a decrease of 13 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.80%, down 3 bps. Refer to the
Consolidated average balance sheets, interest and rates schedule on page 171 for additional information. Net yield
excluding Markets is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16 for an additional discussion of net yield excluding Markets.

Quarterly results The provision for credit losses was
$3.3 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.3 billion and
the net addition to the allowance for credit losses
was $973 million. Net charge-offs included $2.1
billion in consumer , predominantly driven by Card
Services, reflecting the seasoning of vintages
originated in recent years, and $187 million in
wholesale . The net addition to the allowance for
credit losses was largely driven by changes in the
weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, and consisted
of: • $549 million in wholesale , which also reflected
changes in credit quality on client-specific exposures
and the impact of new lending-related commitments, and
• $441 million in consumer , predominantly driven by
Card Services. In the prior year, the provision was
$1.9 billion, net charge-offs were $2.0 billion and
the net reduction in the allowance for credit losses
was $72 million. Refer to CCB, CIB and AWM segment and

(a) Includes depreciation expense associated with auto
operating lease assets. Refer to Note 16 for
additional information. (b) Refer to Note 5 for
additional information. Quarterly results Compensation
expense increased driven by: • higher revenue-related
compensation, particularly in CIB and AWM, and •
growth in the number of employees across the LOBs and
Corporate, primarily in front office and technology.
Noncompensation expense decreased as a result of: •
lower FDIC-related expense, which included the impact
of an FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323
million in Corporate, compared with an accrual
increase of $725 million in the prior year, and • the
absence of restructuring and integration costs
associated with First Republic recorded in the prior
year, offset by • higher legal expense, particularly
in CIB, largely due to the absence of a legal benefit
from the prior year, • higher brokerage expense in CIB
and higher distribution fees in AWM, • higher
investments in marketing, predominantly in CCB, as
well as in technology across the Firm; and to a lesser
extent, • higher occupancy expense, higher operating
losses, largely in CCB, and higher depreciation
expense on higher auto lease assets. Refer to Note 5
for additional information on other expense.

Quarterly results The effective tax rate decreased
predominantly driven by higher benefits related to the
vesting of employee share-based awards in the current
period as a result of the Firm’s higher share price,
and changes in the mix of income and expenses subject
to U.S. federal, state and local taxes.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased driven by Markets activities in CIB and cash
deployment in Treasury and CIO, largely offset by the
impact of higher deposits.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements increased driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities and the impact of lower levels of netting,
as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels
at year-end.

Securities borrowed increased driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven activities.

Refer to Note 10 for additional information on
securities purchased under resale agreements and
securities borrowed .

Trading assets increased due to higher levels of debt
and equity instruments in Markets related to client-
driven market-making activities, as well as when
compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end.
Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities decreased due to lower
available-for-sale ("AFS") and held-to-maturity
("HTM") securities driven by maturities and paydowns.
Refer to Corporate results on pages 30-31, Investment
Portfolio Risk Management on page 64, and Notes 2 and
9 for additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting:

• higher wholesale loans, predominantly in Markets,
associated with higher client demand,

largely offset by

• a reduction in Card Services due to the impact of
seasonality, and

• a decline in Home Lending as loan sales and paydowns
outpaced originations.

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a
net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $863
million, largely driven by changes in the weighted-
average macroeconomic outlook, and consisted of:

• $451 million in consumer , predominantly driven by
Card Services, and

• $412 million in wholesale , which also reflected
changes in credit quality on client-specific
exposures.

There was also a $125 million net addition to the
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized
in other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets.

loans and the total allowance for credit losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased

client-driven activities in CIB.

Deposits increased, reflecting the impact of:

• an increase in CIB predominantly due to net inflows
related to client-driven activities in Securities
Services and Payments,

• an increase in CCB primarily driven by new accounts,
and

• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the
impact of higher-yielding product offerings,
predominantly offset by continued migration into other
investments.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased driven by
Markets, reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities, higher secured financing of trading assets
and the impact of lower levels of netting, as well as
when compared with seasonally lower levels at year-
end.

Short-term borrowings increased driven by higher
financing requirements in Markets.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 40-46 for
additional information on deposits, federal funds
purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; and
Notes 2 and 15 for deposits; and Note 10 for federal
funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements.

Trading liabilities : refer to Notes 2 and 4 for
additional information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased due
to higher client payables related to client-driven
activities in CIB.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs
decreased largely driven by lower levels of
outstanding commercial paper as a result of a decrease
in loan balances in the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits in CIB. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 40-46 and Notes 13 and 22 for additional
information, specifically Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan
securitization trusts.

Long-term debt : refer to Liquidity Risk Management on
pages 40-46 for additional information.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income
and lower unrealized losses in AOCI, predominantly
driven by the impact of lower interest rates on cash
flow hedges and on the AFS portfolio in Treasury and
CIO, largely offset by the impact of capital actions,
including net repurchases of common shares and common
and preferred stock dividend payments. Refer to
Consolidated statements of changes in stockholders’
equity on page 81, Capital Actions on page 37, and

Operating activities • In 2025, cash used resulted from higher trading assets, higher securities borrowed, higher
accrued interest and accounts receivable and lower trading liabilities. • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher
trading assets and higher accrued interest and accounts receivable, partially offset by higher trading liabilities,
accounts payable and other liabilities, and lower other assets. Investing activities • In 2025, cash used resulted
from higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially offset by net proceeds from investment
securities. • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale agreements, partially
offset by proceeds from sales and securitizations of loans held-for-investment.

Financing activities • In 2025, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements, higher deposits, and net proceeds from long-and short-term borrowings. • In 2024, cash provided
reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements, higher deposits, net proceeds from long-
and short-term borrowings and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock. • For both periods, cash was used for
repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated Balance

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 78–82.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis). The
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt
items is recorded within income tax

expense. These adjustments have no impact on net
income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the
LOBs;

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS; and

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 67–69 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of management’s use of non-GAAP financial
measures.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation
from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed
basis.

  BUSINESS SEGMENT & CORPORATE RESULTS  
                                        
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are three
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset &
Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in
Corporate.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as
the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment
results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16 for a
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the reportable business segments are
intended to present each segment as if it were a
stand-alone business. The management reporting process
that derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and therefore further refinements
may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on
at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide
various business metrics which are utilized by the
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing
performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments or businesses within each
segment join efforts to sell products and services to
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating
businesses may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or
service, with allocations to the other segments or
businesses involved in the transaction. The segment
and business results reflect these revenue-sharing
agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and
CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.
Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized
in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic
conditions and other factors, which may impact the
allocation of net interest income to the segments.
Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm
updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits,
which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit
reflected within CCB’s net interest income that is
fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the
Firm’s net interest income.

As a result of lower average interest rates in the
current period, the cost of funding for assets and the
funding benefit earned for liabilities generally
decreased compared with the prior year.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these
risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management
on pages 65-70 for additional information.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and
Corporate is referred to as equity. At least annually,
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may
change. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity
on page 36, and page 104 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results –
Description of business segment reporting methodology
on pages 70–90 and Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for a further discussion of those
methodologies.

(a) Primarily includes operating lease income and commissions and other fees. Operating lease income was $824
million and $665 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. (b) Included
depreciation expense on leased assets of $499 million and $427 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025
and 2024, respectively. (c) Included MSR risk management results of $9 million and $(1) million for the three
months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

Quarterly results Net income was $4.4 billion, down 8%. Net revenue was $18.3 billion, up 4%. Net interest income
was $14.1 billion, up 3%, driven by: • higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by higher revolving balances,
partially offset by • lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management ("BWM"), driven by lower average deposit balances.
Noninterest revenue was $4.2 billion, up 6%, driven by: • higher auto operating lease income as a result of higher
lease origination volume, and • higher asset management fees reflecting higher average market levels, partially
offset by • in BWM, the absence of other service fees associated with First Republic recorded in the prior year, as
well as • lower card income, driven by lower net interchange and an increase in amortization related to new account
origination costs, largely offset by higher annual fees. The net interchange decreased as the impact of increased
debit and credit card sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments. Refer to Note
5 for additional information on card income, asset management fees and commissions and other fees; and Critical
Accounting Estimates on pages 72–75 for additional information on the credit card rewards liability. Noninterest
expense was $9.9 billion, up 6%, reflecting: • higher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven by marketing,
higher auto lease depreciation on higher auto lease assets, and higher operating losses, as well as • higher
compensation expense, predominantly driven by an increase in the number of employees, primarily bankers and
advisors and employees in technology, as well as higher revenue-related compensation for advisors. The provision
for credit losses was $2.6 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.2 billion, up $275 million, predominantly in Card
Services, reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years. The net addition to the allowance for
credit losses of $475 million was predominantly driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook.
                                                        19                                                         
In the prior year, the provision was $1.9 billion, net charge-offs were $1.9 billion and the net addition to the
allowance for credit losses was $34 million. Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on pages 47-64 and
Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 61-63 for a further discussion of the credit portfolios and the allowance for

Quarterly results

Net income was $6.9 billion, up 5%.

Net revenue was $19.7 billion, up 12%.

Banking & Payments revenue was $8.8 billion, up 4%.

• Investment Banking revenue was $2.3 billion, up 2%.
Investment Banking fees were up 12%, driven by higher
debt underwriting and advisory fees, partially offset
by lower equity underwriting fees. The Firm ranked #1
for Global Investment Banking fees, according to
Dealogic.

– Advisory fees were $694 million, up 16%,
predominantly driven by the closing of deals announced
in 2024.

– Debt underwriting fees were $1.2 billion, up 16%,
predominantly driven by elevated refinancing activity,
particularly in leveraged finance.

– Equity underwriting fees were $324 million, down 9%,
as challenging market conditions resulted in lower
fees.

• Payments revenue was $4.6 billion, up 2%. Excluding
the net impact of equity investments, revenue was up
3%, driven by higher average deposits and fee growth,
predominantly offset by deposit margin compression.

• Lending revenue was $1.9 billion, up 11%, driven by
lower fair value losses on credit protection purchased
against certain retained loans and lending-related
commitments, partially offset by lower loan balances.

Markets & Securities Services revenue was $10.9
billion, up 19%. Markets revenue was $9.7 billion, up
21%.

• Equity Markets revenue was $3.8 billion, up 48%,
driven by higher revenue across products, with a
particularly strong performance in Equity Derivatives
amid elevated levels of volatility.

• Fixed Income Markets revenue was $5.8 billion, up
8%, predominantly driven by higher revenue in Rates
and Commodities.

• Securities Services revenue was $1.3 billion, up 7%,
driven by fee growth on higher client activity and
market levels as well as higher average deposits,
partially offset by deposit margin compression.

• Credit Adjustments & Other was a loss of $20
million, compared with a loss of $15 million in the
prior year.

Noninterest expense was $9.8 billion, up 13%,
predominantly driven by higher compensation, including
higher revenue-related compensation and an increase in
the number of employees, as well as higher brokerage
expense and higher legal expense, largely due to the
absence of a legal benefit from the prior year.

The provision for credit losses was $705 million,
predominantly driven by changes in credit quality on
client-specific exposures, changes in the weighted-
average macroeconomic outlook, and the impact of new
lending-related commitments. The net addition to the
allowance for credit losses was $528 million and net
charge-offs were $177 million.

In the prior year, the provision was $1 million, net
charge-offs were $69 million and the net reduction in
the allowance for credit losses was $68 million.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets generally occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives

that are reflected at fair value in principal
transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a
description of the composition of these income
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page
81 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further
information.

(a) Includes the amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated
with First Republic. The discount, which is deferred in other liabilities and recognized on a straight-line basis
over the commitment period, continues to decline as commitments expire.

Quarterly results Net income was $1.6 billion, up 23%. Net revenue was $5.7 billion, up 12%. Net interest income
was $1.7 billion, up 9%. Noninterest revenue was $4.0 billion, up 14%. Revenue from Asset Management was $2.7
billion, up 15%, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees reflecting strong net inflows and higher
average market levels. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $3.1 billion, up 10%, driven by: • higher noninterest
revenue as a result of: – higher management fees due to strong net inflows and higher brokerage fees, partially
offset by – a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related
commitments associated with First Republic that have expired, and • higher net interest income, largely driven by
higher average deposits. Noninterest expense was $3.7 billion, up 7%, largely driven by: • higher compensation,
primarily revenue-related compensation and continued growth in private banking advisor teams, as well as • higher
distribution fees. The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $10 million, compared with a net benefit of
$57 million in the prior year. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on lending related fees. Refer to Credit
and Investment Risk Management on pages 47-64 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages 61-63 for further

(a) Included tax-equivalent adjustments, predominantly driven by tax-exempt income from municipal bonds, of $36
million and $49 million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. (b) Predominantly relates
to the Firm's international consumer initiatives. (c) Included an FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323
million for the three months ended March 31, 2025, and an accrual increase of $725 million for the three months
ended March 31, 2024. (d) In the first quarter of 2025, 768 employees were transferred from the LOBs to Corporate
as a result of the centralization of certain functions.

Quarterly results Net income was $1.7 billion, compared with $676 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $2.3
billion, compared with $2.2 billion in the prior year. Net interest income was $1.7 billion, down 33%, driven by
the impact of lower rates and changes in the FTP for consumer deposits, partially offset by the impact of
securities activity including from prior quarters. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on page 17 for
additional information on FTP. Noninterest revenue was $653 million, compared with a loss of $275 million in the
prior year, driven by: • a $588 million First Republic-related gain, and • lower net investment securities losses
compared to the prior year, which included sales of securities, primarily U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and
U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to
Note 5 for additional information on the First Republic-related gain, and Note 9 and Note 12 for additional
information on the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses. Noninterest expense was
$185 million, down 86%, predominantly driven by: • the impact of an FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323
million, compared with an accrual increase of $725 million in the prior year, and • the absence of restructuring
and integration costs associated with First Republic recorded in the prior year. The provision for credit losses
was a net benefit of $19 million. In the prior year, the provision was $27 million. The current period income tax
expense was predominantly driven by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal,
state and local taxes. Other Corporate includes the Firm's international consumer initiatives, which primarily
consists of Chase U.K., Nutmeg, and an ownership stake in C6 Bank.

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk
governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance framework The
Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and
impacts of risks. Refer to pages 91–95 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and
oversight.

available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s capital risk management.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks
is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets
("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-
balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk.
Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and
an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”).

For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the
capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the
lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches
compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio
requirements.

As of March 31, 2025, the Firm’s Basel III
Standardized risk-based ratios continue to be more
binding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.

Additionally, Basel III requires that Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
calculate their SLRs.

Refer to page 36 of this Form 10-Q and page 104 of
JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional
information on SLR.

Key Regulatory Developments

In April 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to
the calculation of the Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)
for large bank holding companies, including the Firm.
The proposal aims to reduce SCB volatility by using
the average of supervisory stress results from the
previous two annual stress tests to calculate the SCB.
The proposal would also modify the annual effective
date of the SCB from October 1 to January 1 and make
targeted changes to reporting requirements to
streamline data collection. The proposal would be
effective January 1, 2026.

Refer to page 99 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for
information on other Key Regulatory Developments.

(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions. The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase common shares is
utilized at management’s discretion. The $30 billion common share repurchase program approved by the Board of
Directors does not establish specific price targets or timetables. Management determines the amount and timing of
common share repurchases based on various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations
affecting the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill
and intangibles); organic capital generation; current and proposed future capital requirements; and other
investment opportunities. The amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases in any period may be substantially
more or less than the amounts estimated or actually repurchased in prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of
the decision-making process. The Firm’s common share repurchases may be suspended by management at any time. Refer
to Capital actions on page 105 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information.

Capital planning and stress testing Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review On April 7, 2025, the Firm
submitted its 2025 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve
under the Federal Reserve's Comprehensive Capital
Analysis and Review ("CCAR") process. The Firm
anticipates that the Federal Reserve will disclose
summary information regarding the Firm's stress test
results by June 30, 2025. Following the Federal
Reserve's disclosure, the Firm expects to disclose its
indicative SCB requirement, which will become
effective October 1, 2025 under the current rules. The
Firm's SCB is currently 3.3%. Refer to page 33 for Key
Regulatory Developments related to the SCB
requirement. Refer to Capital planning and stress
testing on pages 97–98 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K for additional information on CCAR. Other capital
requirements Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The Federal
Reserve’s total loss-absorbing capacity ("TLAC") rule
requires the U.S. Global Systemically Important Bank
("GSIB") top-tier holding companies, including the
Firm, to maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and
eligible long-term debt ("eligible LTD"). The
following table presents the eligible external TLAC
and eligible LTD amounts, as well as a representation
of these amounts as a percentage of the Firm’s total
RWA and total leverage exposure. As of January 1,
2025, the benefit from the CECL capital transition
provision had been fully phased out. The period ended
December 31, 2024 included the impact of the CECL
capital transition provisions.

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its cash and collateral needs as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to
support its assets and liabilities. For a further
discussion of the Firm's liquidity risk management,
refer to pages 108–115 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K and to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports,
which are available on the Firm’s website. LCR and
HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA
that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated
total net cash outflows over a prospective 30
calendar-day period of significant stress. Under the
LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone
100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for
both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
required to be a minimum of 100%. The following table
summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s
average LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2025,
December 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024 based on the

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Eligible HQLA securities
may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment
securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of calculating the LCR, HQLA securities are
included at fair value, which may differ from the accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. (c) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of regulatory haircuts under the LCR rule.
(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended
March 31, 2024, primarily driven by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company,
predominantly offset by common stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s
average LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2025 decreased compared with the three months ended March 31,
2024, due to dividend payments to the Parent Company and loan growth, largely offset by activities in CIB Markets,
an increase in deposits and a reduction in non-HQLA securities. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s
average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net
cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as
other factors. Refer to page 109 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for
additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity
stress testing to monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material legal entities under a variety of
adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal
stress tests are produced on a daily basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market
events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and
assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm manages liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding
Company (“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and
minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may
be disrupted.

In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had
unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and
debt securities, that the Firm believes would be
available to raise liquidity. This includes excess
eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The
fair value of these securities was approximately $635
billion and $594 billion as of March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, respectively, although the amount
of liquidity that could be raised at any particular
time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The increase compared to December 31,
2024, was driven by an increase in unencumbered CIB
trading assets, largely offset by a decrease in excess
eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.

The Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4
trillion of available cash and securities as of March
31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. For each
respective period, the amount was comprised of
eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of
regulatory haircuts, of approximately $881 billion and
$834 billion, and unencumbered marketable securities
with a fair value of approximately $635 billion and
$594 billion.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
Federal Home Loan Banks ("FHLBs") and the discount
window at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of
collateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of
approximately $408 billion and $413 billion as of
March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
This borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash
and securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or
other unencumbered securities that are currently
pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window
and other central banks. Although available, the Firm
does not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal
Reserve Banks discount window and the other central
banks as a primary source of liquidity.

The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

For the three months ended March 31, 2025, both the
Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with
the 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's
interpretation of the final NSFR rule. Refer to the
Firm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report for the quarterly
periods ended December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024
on the Firm’s website for additional information.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including deposits, secured
and unsecured funding in the capital markets and
stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding
source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through
short- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance
of unsecured long-term debt, or from

borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings
which are primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and
liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion
of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and
wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods
of market disruption, average deposit trends may be
impacted.

Average deposits increased for the three months ended
March 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended
March 31, 2024, reflecting the net impact of:

• an increase in CIB due to net inflows related to
client-driven activities in Payments and Securities
Services, partially offset by net maturities of
structured notes in Markets,

• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, and

• a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in
balances in existing accounts due to migration into
higher-yielding investments and increased customer
spending, predominantly offset by new accounts.

Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 2024,
reflecting the impact of:

• an increase in CIB predominantly due to net inflows
related to client-driven activities in Securities
Services and Payments,

• an increase in CCB primarily driven by new accounts,
and

• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances
in new and existing client accounts, reflecting the
impact of higher-yielding product offerings,
predominantly offset by continued migration into other
investments.

Analysis and the Business Segment & Corporate Results
on pages 12-13 and pages 17-31, respectively, for
further information on deposit and liability balance
trends. Refer to Note 3 for further information on
structured notes.

Certain deposits are covered by insurance protection
that provides additional funding stability and results
in a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection

be available to depositors in the countries in which
the deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC
provides deposit insurance protection for deposits
placed in a U.S. depository institution. R efer to
pages 111–112 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for
additional information on the Firm's total uninsured
deposits. The table below presents an estimate of
uninsured U.S. and non-U.S. time deposits, and their
remaining maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its
uninsured U.S. time deposits are based on data that

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s primary source of short-term secured
funding is securities sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured
predominantly by high-quality securities collateral,
including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2025,
compared with December 31, 2024, driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities, higher secured financing of trading assets
and the impact of lower levels of netting, as well as
when compared with seasonally lower levels at year-
end.

The increase in secured other borrowed funds at March
31, 2025 from December 31, 2024 and for the average
three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the
prior year period, was due to higher financing
requirements in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s primary sources of short-term unsecured
funding consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds.

The decrease in commercial paper at March 31, 2025
from December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by
strategic short-term liquidity management.

The increase in unsecured other borrowed funds for the
average three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to
the prior year period, was primarily driven by net
issuances of structured notes in Markets.
                                                        44                                                         
Long-term funding Long-term funding provides an
additional source of stable funding and liquidity for
the Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven
primarily by expected client activity, liquidity
considerations and regulatory requirements, including
TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining
diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various
funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its
optimal long-term funding plan. Unsecured funding and
issuance The significant majority of the Firm’s total
outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the
Parent Company to provide flexibility in support of
the funding needs of both bank and non-bank
subsidiaries. The Parent Company advances
substantially all net funding proceeds to its
subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to
external counterparties. The increase in structured
notes for the average three months ended March 31,
2025, compared to the prior year period, was primarily
driven by net issuances of structured notes in Markets
due to client demand. The following table summarizes
long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or
redemptions for the three months ended March 31, 2025
and 2024. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages
108–115 and Note 20 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K
for additional information on the IHC and long-term
debt.

The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm

believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and
stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to
Notes 4 and 13 for additional information.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and certain
of its principal subsidiaries as of March 31, 2025
were as follows:

Refer to Note 16 for further information.

(c) Includes scored auto and business banking loans, and overdrafts.

(d) Includes scored mortgage loans held in CCB and CIB, and other consumer unsecured loans in CIB.

(e) Credit card, home equity and certain business banking lending-related commitments represent the total available
lines of credit for these products. The Firm has not experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines
of credit would be used at the same time. Refer to Note 22 for further information.

(f) Includes billed interest and fees.

(g) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CIB.

past due. These loans have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. At March 31, 2025 and December 31,
2024, mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies were $117 million and $121
million, respectively. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on
nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(j) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $18.4 billion and $15.1 billion for the three

Portfolio analysis Loans decreased from December 31,
2024 driven by lower residential real estate loans,
including retained and at fair value, largely offset
by higher loans at fair value in auto and other.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at
fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage
loans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans
decreased compared to December 31, 2024, driven by
paydowns, net of originations. Net recoveries were
higher for the three months ended March 31, 2025
compared to the same period in the prior year, driven
by loan sales. Loans held-for-sale and nonaccrual
loans held-for-sale decreased from December 31, 2024,
predominantly driven by loan sales. Loans at fair
value decreased compared to December 31, 2024, driven
by lower Home Lending loans, as warehouse loan sales
outpaced originations, largely offset by an increase
in CIB as purchases outpaced sales. Nonaccrual loans
at fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2024,
predominantly driven by loan sales in CIB. At March
31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying value of
retained interest-only residential mortgage loans was
$88.7 billion and $88.9 billion, respectively. These
loans have an interest-only payment period generally
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully
amortizing payment period to maturity and are
typically originated as higher-balance loans to
higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of
this portfolio is comparable to the performance of the
broader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value
of retained home equity lines of credit outstanding
was $13.9 billion at March 31, 2025, including $3.7
billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only
to fully amortizing payments or have been modified,
and $3.5 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs,
which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages
the risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by
reducing or canceling the undrawn line in accordance
with the contract or to the extent otherwise permitted
by law, including when there has been a demonstrable
decline in the creditworthiness of the borrower or
significant decrease in the value of the underlying
property.

The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s
residential mortgage portfolio insured and/or
guaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly
loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value. The Firm
monitors its exposure to certain potential
unrecoverable claim payments related to government-
insured loans and considers this exposure in
estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, generally consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans,
other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The
portfolio increased when compared to December 31,
2024, predominantly driven by an increase in loans at
fair value due to purchases of other consumer
unsecured loans in CIB. Nonperforming assets The

Refer to Note 11 for further information about the consumer credit portfolio, including information about
delinquencies, other credit quality indicators and loans that were in the process of active or suspended
foreclosure.

Credit card Total credit card loans decreased from December 31, 2024 reflecting the impact of seasonality. The
March 31, 2025 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.21% and 1.16%, respectively, increased compared to the
December 31, 2024 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.17% and 1.14%, respectively, in line with the Firm's
expectations. Net charge-offs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in
the prior year reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years. Consistent with the Firm’s policy,
all credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan
losses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to Note 11
for further information about this portfolio, including information about delinquencies. Geographic and FICO
composition of credit card loans Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the
Firm’s credit card loans.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 54-57 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. As of March 31, 2025, loans increased $18.9
billion, predominantly driven by higher loans in CIB Markets. Lending-related commitments increased $17.4 billion
driven by higher commitments in CIB. As of March 31, 2025, nonperforming exposure was relatively flat, with
increases in Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Consumer & Retail, reflecting downgrades and a new held-
for-sale loan, predominantly offset by Real Estate, concentrated in Office, resulting from upgrades and paydowns.
For the three months ended March 31, 2025, wholesale net charge-offs were $187 million across multiple industries,
including Real Estate and Healthcare.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as
of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of
JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally
based on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at March 31, 2025,
may become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.

  Wholesale credit exposure – industry exposures                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized
exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure,
excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $45.5 billion and $44.7 billion as of March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, representing approximately 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure as of both period ends; of
the $45.5 billion, $40.7 billion was performing.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The
industry of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to
Note 4 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

and institutional clients to high-net-worth
individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion
on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality
indicators. The following table presents the change in
the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the three months
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Since March 31, 2024,
nonaccrual loan exposure increased by $1.3 billion,
predominantly driven by Real Estate, concentrated in
Multifamily and Lodging, Technology, Media &
Telecommunications, Consumer & Retail and Healthcare,
in each case resulting from downgrades primarily
offset by net portfolio activity.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on
deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable
debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk,
the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors
the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to
collateral maintenance requirements is generally
mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of
the activity, the fair value of collateral held and
the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s
obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair
value of the collateral declines. Because of these
mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not
require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in
management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses
is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses
based on the value of the collateral and probability
of borrower default. These receivables are reported
within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the
Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for
further information on the Firm’s accounting policies
for the allowance for credit losses.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the

credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-
the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, the Firm is exposed
to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For
exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures
and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-
cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to
the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,
the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures
arising from derivative contracts through the use of
legally enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s
OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity and centrally
cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 85% and 86% at March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for
additional information on the Firm’s use of collateral
agreements and for a further discussion of derivative
contracts, counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets was $60.5 billion and
$61.0 billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
respectively. The decrease was primarily as a result
of market movements. Derivative receivables represent
the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the
Firm.

In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and
other cash collateral that may be used as security
when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the
Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of
liquid securities is consistent with the definition of
high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits
of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount
of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
receivables balances and is not included in the tables
below, it is available as security against potential
exposure that could arise should the fair value of the
client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s
favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on
the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative
transactions.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm's
allowance for credit losses generally consists of: •
the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and
is presented separately on the Consolidated balance
sheets, • the allowance for lending-related
commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable
and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on
investment securities, which is reflected in
investment securities on the Consolidated balance
sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The
allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2025 was
$27.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.0
billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to
the allowance for credit losses was largely driven by
changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook,
including the qualitative adjustment to reflect
additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios due
to elevated risks and uncertainties related to the
geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The net
addition to the allowance for credit losses included:
• $562 million in wholesale , which also reflected
changes in credit quality on client-specific exposures
and the impact of new lending-related commitments, and
• $441 million in consumer , predominantly driven by
Card Services. The Firm's allowance for credit losses
is estimated using a weighted average of five
internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The
adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions provided in the following table, resulting
in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate
peaking at 5.8% in the first quarter of 2026, and • a
weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.6%
lower than the central case at the end of the second
quarter of 2026.

The following table presents the Firm’s central case
assumptions for the periods presented:

(c) The Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on nonaccrual status as permitted
by regulatory guidance.

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At March 31,
2025, the Treasury and CIO investment securities
portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was
$661.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages 30-31
and Note 9 for further information on the investment
securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer
to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 40-46 for
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer
to Market Risk Management on pages 65-70 for further
information on the market risk inherent in the
portfolio.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve based on market circumstances and in line with
its strategic initiatives. The table below presents
the aggregate carrying values of the principal
investment portfolios as of March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
141–149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.

Value-at-risk

JPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk

(a) Divers ification benefit represents the difference between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its individual
components. This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and
risk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR
for each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.

(b) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans
and lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include
the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

(c) Includes credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments. This VaR
does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

(d) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded.

(e) In the first quarter of 2025, the elevated average and maximum VaR was due to a client-driven equity position
that has since matured.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR
for the five trailing quarters. The movements in the
second quarter of 2024 were primarily driven by
changes in Visa Class C common share exposure in the
Firm's Corporate VaR and the movements in the first
quarter of 2025 were due to a client-driven equity
position that has since matured.

  VaR backtesting                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five
times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended March 31, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 172 of the 259 days, and observed 11
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 42 of
the 63 days, and observed three VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended March 31, 2025. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities which are included in VaR, but also from
the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which
include extension of loans and credit facilities,
taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the
investment securities portfolio, and associated
derivative instruments.

One way that the Firm evaluates its structural
interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.
Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate
exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest
rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes
to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets
and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other
currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These
simulations primarily include retained and held-for-
sale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and
financing activities, investment securities, long-term
debt, related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer
pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and
other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. These
simulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar
foreign exchange exposures arising from capital
investments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange
risk on page 149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
more information.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential
change to a baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both
short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and
holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term
rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These
scenarios consider many different factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in
the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects
certain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s
balance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening
and usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that
require management judgment. The amount of deposits
that the Firm holds at any given time may be
influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as
broader monetary conditions and competition for
deposits.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as
deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit
rates paid could change upon a given change in market
interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ
from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to
customer behavior and competition for deposits.

The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the
assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,
including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts
of deposit balances, both of which are especially
significant in the case of consumer deposits. The
results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to
the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures
of the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s
actual net interest income for the rate changes
presented may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios
are modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any
actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients
or customers in response to rate changes. Other
significant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk
scenarios, including mortgage prepayments and deposit
rates paid, may also differ from actual results. The
Firm’s forecast for net interest income is included in
the Firm’s outlook on page 8.

(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates, including hedges of non-U.S. dollar
capital investments. Non-U.S. dollar sensitivities were insignificant. The change in the Firm’s sensitivities as of
March 31, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024, were primarily driven by the net impact of Treasury and CIO actions,
partially offset by the impact of changes in Firmwide deposits and loans, primarily in balances. Treasury and CIO
actions consisted of an increase in cash flow hedges of floating rate retained loans which added duration,
partially offset by securities activity.

Economic value sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of
earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures economic value sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the
longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily
retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate
scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions
for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk
management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the
EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value measurement note to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. For example, certain assets and liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables
and deposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held
to maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 95 in Note 2.

  Other sensitivity-based measures                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at March 31, 2025 and December 31,
2024, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s
expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 150–151 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table
presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2025 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2024. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including
client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The decrease in exposure
to Japan when compared to December 31, 2024 was predominantly driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central
bank of Japan as a result of client-driven market-making activities. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to
Russia, which corresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of
clients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to
Russia is not material. Refer to Note 24 on pages 165-166 for information concerning Russian litigation.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and
Allowance for credit losses on pages 61-63 and Note 12
of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-

quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses
being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty
variables. The specific variables that have the
greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by
portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional
U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.
interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil
prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S.
HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 61 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher over the
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 2.9% in the first quarter of 2026.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including:

• The allowance as of March 31, 2025, reflects credit
losses beyond those estimated under the central
scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse
scenarios.
                                                        72                                                         
• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this
analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe
changes in macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of
future changes in portfolio composition and borrower
behavior can significantly affect the allowance for
credit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of
credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of
March 31, 2025, the Firm compared the modeled
estimates under its relative adverse scenario to its
central scenario. Without considering offsetting or
correlated effects in other qualitative components of
the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison
between these two scenarios for the exposures below
reflect the following differences: • An increase of
approximately $1.0 billion for residential real estate
loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of
approximately $3.7 billion for credit card loans • An
increase of approximately $4.6 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments This analysis
relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall
allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the
quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the
modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and
conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of
macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the
Firm believes that its process to consider the
available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable
and appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2025.

Fair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including trading assets and
liabilities, AFS securities, structured note products
and certain securities financing agreements. Certain
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home
equity and other loans, where the carrying value is
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Assets measured at fair value The following table
includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and
the portion of such assets that are classified within
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2

be reduced if netting were applied, including the

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair
value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value
requires the application of judgment. The type and
level of judgment required is largely dependent on the
amount of observable market information available to
the Firm. For instruments valued using internally
developed valuation models and other valuation
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs
and are therefore classified within level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair
value are more significant than those required when
estimating the fair value of instruments classified
within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
                              
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorganChase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorganChase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorganChase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there
is no assurance that any list of risks and
uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to
differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and
political conditions and geopolitical events,
including geopolitical tensions and hostilities;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting
the Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to
address those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and
scrutiny of JPMorganChase’s business practices,
including dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws;

• Changes in trade policies, including the imposition
of tariffs and retaliatory responses;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Changes in FDIC assessments;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including
changes in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending
or savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its
capital and liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or
its subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,
environmental and sustainability concerns that may
arise, including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an
economic slowdown or other economic or market
disruption, including, but not limited to, in the
interest rate environment;

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its
counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
require the Firm to incur liabilities or absorb losses
not contemplated at their initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified
employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,
customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of
certain assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate
change or extraordinary events beyond the Firm's
control, and the Firm’s ability to deal effectively
with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational
systems or those of third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself
against cyber attacks and other attempts by
unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm
or its customers or to disrupt the Firm’s systems; and

• The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part
I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and
JPMorganChase does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements. The reader should,
however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”),
a financial holding company incorporated under
Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services
firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The
Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial
services for consumers and small businesses,
commercial banking, financial transaction processing
and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for further
discussion of the Firm's reportable business segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of
JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies
conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines
prescribed by regulatory authorities. The preparation
of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
could be different from these estimates. In the
opinion of management, all normal, recurring
adjustments have been included such that this interim
financial information is fairly stated. These
unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes thereto
included in JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of JPMorganChase and other
entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial
interest. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for
clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm
are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included
on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm
determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the
entity is a voting interest entity or a variable
interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further
description of JPMorganChase’s accounting policies
regarding consolidation.

Offsetting assets and liabilities

U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative
receivables and derivative payables with the same
counterparty and the related cash collateral
receivables and payables on a net basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable
master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also
permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase
agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under
securities loan agreements to be presented net when
specified conditions are met, including the existence
of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The
Firm has elected to net such balances where it has
determined that the specified conditions are met.
Refer to Note 1 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
further information on offsetting assets and
liabilities.

(a) At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 152.5billion and $
120.1billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in
                                                        86                                                         
fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide
consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each
period presented.

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2025 and December
31, 2024, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real
estate and other funds, were $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively, primarily reported in other assets.

(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-
parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 390million, nonagency securities of $ 5million and
non-trading loans of $ 451million.

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 15million, trading loans of $ 66million and non-trading loans of $
1.3billion.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 737million and non-trading loans of $ 605million.

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 764million including $ 631million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as
well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range
of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)
for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the
determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable
factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3
financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair
value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or
losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such
level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes
The following describes significant changes to level 3
assets since December 31, 2024, for those items
measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to
Assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis on page 93 for further information
on changes impacting items measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis. Three months ended March 31, 2025
Level 3 assets were $ 24.2billion at March 31, 2025,
reflecting an increase of $ 430million from December
31, 2024. The increase for the three months ended
March 31, 2025 was driven by higher: • Gross
derivative receivables of $ 653million due to gains
and purchases largely offset by settlements. partially
offset by • lower trading loans of $ 285million due to
net transfers. Refer to the sections below for
additional information. Transfers between levels for
instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis
For the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024,
there were no significant transfers from level 2 into
level 3 or from level 3 into level 2. All transfers
are based on changes in the observability and/or
significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed
to occur at the beginning of the quarterly reporting
period in which they occur. Gains and losses The
following describes significant components of total
realized/unrealized gains/(losses) for instruments
measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the
periods indicated. These amounts exclude any effects
of the Firm’s risk management activities where the
financial instruments are classified as level 1 and 2
of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Changes in level
3 recurring fair value measurements rollforward tables
on pages 89-92 for further information on these
instruments.

liabilities, driven by gains in long-term debt due to
market movements partially offset by losses in
deposits and short-term borrowings due to market
movements. Three months ended March 31, 2024 • $

2025, $ 226million related to equity securities adjusted based on the measurement alternative. These equity
securities are classified as level 3 due to the infrequency of the observable prices and/or the restrictions on the
shares.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2024 was $ 3.7billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative
purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.
(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2025 were $ 1.2billion.
(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2025 were $(
1.5) billion.
Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6million Visa Class B-2 common shares
("Visa B-2 shares") and 37.2million Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) reflected in the Firm's
principal investment portfolio as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

The Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common
shares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters
involving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5342at March 31, 2025 and may be
adjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation
matters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown.
Accordingly, as of March 31, 2025, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on
Visa B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result
of these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar
to Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis.

Separately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative
instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the
conversion rate. As of March 31, 2025, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 11.6million Visa B-2
shares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions. Refer to
page 200 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information.

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

(a) Excludes the current carrying values of the guarantee liability and the offsetting asset, each of which is
recognized at fair value at the inception of the guarantees.
(b) Includes the wholesale allowance for lending-related commitments.
The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments with or without notice to the borrower, as permitted by law, or in
accordance with the contract. Refer to page 183 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities,
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The profit and
loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be measured at fair
value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are not included in
the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were not material for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.
(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.
(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.
(d) Reported in other income.
(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information
regarding interest income and interest expense.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of March 31, 2025 and December 31,
2024.
(c) Includes loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies less than 90 days past due.
(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair
value option was elected was $ 12.3billion and $ 12.2billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $
3million and $ 50million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

JPMorganChase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

types of credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        101                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables, up to the fair
value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with
the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables.

(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.
(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative
instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts
of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the
case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances
with that counterparty.
(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $ 46.9billion and $ 51.9billion at March 31, 2025
and December 31, 2024. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $ 53.8billion and $ 60.8billion
at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and OTC-cleared
derivative instruments.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at March 31, 2025 and December
31, 2024, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features
that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which
additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The
liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating
agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied
to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets
related to certain cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that are expected to reverse through the income
statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 8.2billion and $ 6.2billion at March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At March 31,
2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities was $ 28.6billion and $ 28.7billion,
respectively. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying amount excluded for long-term debt was $
541million and $ 518million, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At March 31, 2025 and December
31, 2024, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 70.3billion and $ 72.8billion,
of which $ 47.6billion and $ 41.2billion was designated as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is
the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and
forward starting layers. At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $(
734) million and $( 1.7) billion, which is comprised of $ 462million and $( 1.2) billion for active hedging
relationships, and $( 1.2) billion and $( 566) million for discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer
to Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will
reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three months ended March 31,
2025 and 2024, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line item
in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net
interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended March 31,
2025 and 2024.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.6) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in
AOCI at March 31, 2025, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized
in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

Net investment hedge gains and losses
The following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge
accounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended
March 31, 2025 and 2024.

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The changes in fair value of these
amounts are recorded in net interest income.
(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income associated with net investment hedges. There were no sales or
liquidations of legal entities that resulted in reclassifications for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and
2024. Refer to Note 19 for further information.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in mortgage
commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and
losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s
wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk
arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(d) Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.

(b) Predominantly represents Other protection purchased by CIB.

(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.

(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.

(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. Also includes credit protection against
certain loans and lending-related commitments in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit
derivatives and credit-related notes.

The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, where JPMorganChase is the seller of protection. The
maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings
profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The
ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorganChase is the purchaser of protection are
comparable to the profile reflected below.

Principal transactions
The following table presents all realized and
unrealized gains and losses recorded in principal
transactions revenue. This table excludes interest
income and interest expense on trading assets and

performance of the Firm’s client-driven market-making
activities in CIB and fund deployment activities in
Treasury and CIO. Refer to Note 6 for further
information on interest income and interest expense.
Trading revenue is presented primarily by instrument

portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio.

(a) Represents the amount of portfolio layer method basis adjustments related to AFS securities hedged in a closed
portfolio. Under U.S. GAAP portfolio layer method basis adjustments are not allocated to individual securities,
however, the amounts impact the unrealized gains or losses in the table for the types of securities being hedged.
Refer to Note 4 for additional information.
(b) The Firm purchased $ 1.6billion and $ 479million of HTM securities for the three months ended March 31, 2025
and 2024, respectively.
(c) The amortized cost of investment securities is reported net of allowance for credit losses of $ 118million and
$ 152million at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.
(d) Excludes $ 3.9billion and $ 3.7billion of accrued interest receivable at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
respectively. The Firm did not reverse through interest income any accrued interest receivable for the three months
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024. Refer to Note 10 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further discussion of
accounting policies for accrued interest receivable on investment securities.

AFS securities impairment
The following tables present the fair value and gross unrealized losses by aging category for AFS securities at
March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The tables exclude U.S. Treasury and government agency securities and U.S.
GSE and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 3.1billion and $ 5.3billion, at March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in
interest rates rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by
the U.S. government.

HTM securities – credit risk Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM
securities is the risk rating assigned to each
security. At both March 31, 2025 and December 31,
2024, all HTM securities were rated investment grade
and were current and accruing, with approximately 99%
rated at least AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily
upon internal risk ratings).

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities as of March 31, 2025 was $ 118million,
which included a $ 17million reduction in allowance
related to a sale of a corporate debt security. As of
March 31, 2024, the allowance for credit losses in
investment securities was $ 154million. Refer to Note
10 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio
hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal
prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield
is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for
credit losses of $ 36million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $ 463million at March
31, 2025. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $
82million at March 31, 2025.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, six yearsfor agency residential collateralized
mortgage obligations, and five yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which
the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and
collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the
Firm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. When the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant
netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”
presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-
for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities
within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Firm held $ 910million and $ 805million, respectively, of financial
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a
sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions.
The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded
primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB.
(b) Includes scored auto, business banking and consumer unsecured loans as well as overdrafts, primarily in CCB.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, AWM, Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the bank regulatory
agencies, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, SPEs, personal investment companies and trusts, individuals and
individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within
CCB), states and political subdivisions, as well as loans to nonprofits. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were
not material at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not
material at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee.

(c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 38% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At March 31, 2025,
approximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at March
31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 37million and $ 43million for the three
months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at March 31, 2025.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of residential
real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty. The Firm's proprietary modification
programs as well as government programs, including
U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty including, but not limited to, interest
rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-
insignificant payment deferral and principal
forgiveness that would otherwise have been required
under the terms of the original agreement, are
considered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's
2024 Form 10-K for further information. Financial
effects of FDMs For the three months ended March 31,
2025, retained residential real estate FDMs were $
61million. The financial effects of the FDMs, which
were largely in the form of term extensions and
interest rate reductions, included extending the
weighted-average life of the loans by 15years, and
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest
rate from 7.41% to 6.18% for the three months ended
March 31, 2025. For the three months ended March 31,
2024, retained residential real estate FDMs were $
39million. The financial effects of the FDMs, which
were predominantly in the form of term extensions and
interest rate reductions, included extending the
weighted-average life of the loans by 16years, and
reducing the weighted-average contractual interest
rate from 7.39% to 4.28% for the three months ended
March 31, 2024. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31,
2024, there were noadditional commitments to lend to
borrowers experiencing financial difficulty whose
loans have been modified as FDMs. For the three months
ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, loans subject to a
trial modification, where the terms of the loans have
not been permanently modified, and Chapter 7 loans
were not material.

Defaults of FDMs Retained residential real estate FDMs
that defaulted during the three months ended March 31,
2025 and 2024 and were reported as FDMs in the twelve
months prior to the default were not material. Active
and suspended foreclosure At March 31, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, the Firm had retained residential
real estate loans, excluding those insured by U.S.
government agencies, with a carrying value of $
603million and $ 576million, respectively, that were

(a) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three months ended
March 31, 2025 and 2024 .

(c) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at March 31, 2025.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These
modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for
60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not
make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and
will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not
reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

twoconsecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

Internal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans. The following tables
provide information on internal risk rating and gross charge-offs.

(a) At March 31, 2025 and 2024, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also
had an allowance for credit losses of $ 283million and $ 274million, respectively, associated with certain accounts
receivable in CIB.
(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans.
(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) At March 31, 2025 and 2024, lending-related commitments excluded $ 20.3billion and $ 17.7billion, respectively,
for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 1.0trillion and $ 943.9billion, respectively, for the
credit card portfolio segment; and $ 26.3billion and $ 20.9billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio
segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.

Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2025 was $ 27.8billion,
reflecting a net addition of $ 1.0billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to the allowance for credit
losses was largely driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, including the qualitative
adjustment to reflect additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios due to elevated risks and uncertainties
related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses
included: • $ 562million in wholesale , which also reflected changes in credit quality on client-specific exposures
and the impact of new lending-related commitments, and • $ 441million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card
Services. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed
macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central
case assumptions provided in the following table, resulting in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking
at 5.8% in the first quarter of 2026, and • a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.6% lower than the
central case at the end of the second quarter of 2026.

assumptions for the periods presented:

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the
Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase
Issuance Trust. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized)
originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB
and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm
may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        142                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests. Refer to page 148 of this Note for information on the securitization-related loan delinquencies
and liquidation losses.

As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Firm did not consolidate any U.S. GSE and government agency re-
securitization VIEs or any Firm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs.

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase makes markets in and invests in commercial
paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 3.2billion and $ 2.9billion of the
commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs
and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued
by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 12.5billion and $ 10.3billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to
extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal
bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their
municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer
TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

(b) Primarily includes consumer loans in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the
Consolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial
interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorganChase. Included in beneficial interests
in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.5billion at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These
include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement
agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual
credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the
underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,
the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated
balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party
transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are
limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing
member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does
not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure,
represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 34.3billion and $ 35.2billion at March 31, 2025
and December 31, 2024, of which $ 13.9billion and $ 15.0billion was unfunded at March 31, 2025 and December 31,
2024, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk

of loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer
to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm
elected the proportional amortization method for certain tax-oriented investments on a program-by-program basis.
The proportional amortization method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, be
amortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in income
tax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Investments must meet certain
criteria to be eligible, including that substantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income
tax benefits. In addition, under this method deferred taxes are generally not recorded as the investment is now
amortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity
contributions that are unconditional and legally binding or conditional and probable of occurring are recorded in
other liabilities with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the investment. The guidance also requires
a reevaluation of eligible investments when significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in
the nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. During the period,
there were no significant modifications or events that resulted in a change in the nature of an eligible investment
or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project.
The following table provides information on tax-
oriented investments for which the Firm elected to
apply the proportional amortization method.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm
may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,
the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In
those transactions, upon the termination of the
vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party
Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not
have any intent to protect Residual holders from
potential losses on any of the underlying municipal
bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB
trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic
performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s
maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer
TOB trusts at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was
$ 6.2billion and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair
value of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2025
and December 31, 2024 was $ 8.5billion and $
8.1billion, respectively.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and loans in securitization transactions
pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,
the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated
excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for
the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement
of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these
loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the
securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of
loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the
purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.
The following table summarizes the activities related
to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in
securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to
material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to
repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s

Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses
The table below includes information about components of and delinquencies related to nonconsolidated securitized
financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing
involvement as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For loans sold or securitized where servicing is the Firm’s
only form of continuing involvement, the Firm generally experiences a loss only if the Firm was required to
repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with
its loan sale or servicing contracts.

Note 14 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and
other intangible assets

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of goodwill, mortgage servicing
rights, and other intangible assets and the related
accounting policies. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded
upon completion of a business combination as the
difference between the purchase price and the fair
value of the net assets acquired, and can be adjusted
up to one year from the acquisition date as additional
information pertaining to facts and circumstances that
existed as of the acquisition date is obtained about
the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.
The following table presents goodwill attributed to
the reportable business segments and Corporate.

Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or
more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be
an impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s goodwill
impairment testing. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in
capital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative
changes or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s
reporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a
future period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of March 31, 2025, the Firm reviewed current
economic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of
business performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31,
2025 or December 31, 2024, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31,
2025 or 2024.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.
The following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.

(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result
of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.
(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.

and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g.,
cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and outlines the
sensitivities of those fair values to immediate
adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined
below.

Other intangible assets The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are initially recorded
at their fair value primarily upon completion of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets, including
core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles, and certain other intangible assets, are amortized
over their useful lives, estimated based on the expected future economic benefits. The Firm’s intangible assets
with indefinite lives, such as asset management contracts, are not subject to amortization and are assessed
periodically for impairment. As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the net carrying values of other
intangible assets consisted of finite-lived intangible assets of $ 1.6billion and $ 1.7billion, respectively, as
well as indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, of $ 1.2billion at both periods.

Firm as lessee

At March 31, 2025, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries
were obligated under a number of noncancellable
leases, predominantly operating leases for premises
and equipment used primarily for business purposes.

Operating lease liabilities and right-of-use (“ROU”)
assets are recognized at the lease commencement date
based on the present value of the future minimum lease
payments over the lease term.
The carrying values of the Firm’s operating leases
were as follows:

The Firm’s net rental expense was $ 573million and $
541million for the three months ended March 31, 2025
and 2024, respectively.

Firm as lessor

The Firm’s lease financings are predominantly auto
operating leases, and are included in other assets on
the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.
The following table presents the Firm’s operating
lease income, included within other income, and the
related depreciation expense, included within
technology, communications and equipment expense, on

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital. The
Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as
a consolidated financial holding company. The Office
of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") establishes
similar minimum capital requirements and standards for
the Firm’s principal insured depository institution
("IDI") subsidiary, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under
the risk-based capital and leverage-based guidelines
of the Federal Reserve, JPMorgan Chase & Co. is
required to maintain minimum ratios for CET1 capital,
Tier 1 capital, Total capital, Tier 1 leverage and the
SLR. Failure to meet these minimum requirements could
cause the Federal Reserve to take action. JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. is also subject to these capital
requirements established by its primary regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios
to which the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were
subject as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition Beginning January
1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL capital benefit,
provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, was phased out at 25% per year over
a three-year period and fully phased out as of January
1, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm's CET1
capital reflected the remaining benefit of $
720million associated with the CECL capital transition
provisions. Similarly, as of January 1, 2025, the Firm
has phased out the other CECL capital transition
provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as
applicable. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital
transition provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorganChase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31,
2025 and December 31, 2024. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business
banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not
experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to the extent
otherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the
borrower or significant decrease in the value of underlying property.

(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.

(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CIB.

(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.

(d) As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations
totaling $ 147million and $ 85million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $ 9.5billion
at both periods for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; $ 526million and $ 556million,
respectively, for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are
shown gross of risk participations.

(e) As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending
indemnification agreements was $ 376.7billion and $ 328.7billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral
primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies.

(f) As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under
the sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain
clearing houses.

(g) As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, primarily includes unfunded commitments to purchase secondary
market loans, other equity investment commitments, and unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity
investments.

(h) For lending-related products, the carrying value includes the allowance for lending-related commitments and the
guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value
option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.

(i) For lending-related commitments, the carrying value also includes fees and any purchase discounts or premiums
that are deferred and recognized in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred amounts for revolving commitments and commitments not expected to fund, are amortized to lending- and
deposit-related fees on a straight line basis over the commitment period. For all other commitments the deferred
amounts remain deferred until the commitment funds or is sold.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of
commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper
facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well
as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose
facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition
financings, trade financings and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other
financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

In addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and
seller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit
derivatives.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase
demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its
litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding litigation.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment
networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the
Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,
retains a contingent liability for disputed processed
credit and debit card transactions that result in a
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved
in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the
cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount
to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction
to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the
amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss
for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder.
The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or
obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.
Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a
sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term
resale and repurchase agreements through the
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and
full payment and performance of its sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s
rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these
guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the
cash or high-quality securities collateral that the
clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the
Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s
maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included
in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and
commitments line on page 161. Refer to Note 11 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional
information on credit risk mitigation practices on
resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged
under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of
subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain
long-term debt and structured notes of its
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial
Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 161 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.
The following table presents the carrying value of the
Firm’s pledged assets.

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.

Contingencies

As of March 31, 2025, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations,
regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations
and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or
investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of
claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection
claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to
approximately $ 1.1billion at March 31, 2025. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was
based upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate
of reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can
be made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves
significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that
many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the
Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of
the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the
uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions
concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties
or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular
proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the
likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably
possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are
descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian
state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse)
SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the
validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by
1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a
new claim in the future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals court is scheduled to
hear both appeals in November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In
addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan
(Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions
arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons
for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement
Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010
and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase entities into residential housing projects
developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential
units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million,
and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making
preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore
funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the
inquiry.
                                                        164                                                        
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those
activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal
antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates
to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining
FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before
the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related individual and
putative class actions filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia
remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a
request for class certification on an opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this decision to the U.K. Supreme
Court. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to
court approval. In Australia, the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action. The
settlement is subject to Court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed
a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set
the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In
September 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively
contributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the
settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action
seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class
certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval
of a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their
respective network rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are
considering next steps. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed
individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other
banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who
opted out representing approximately 80% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales
volume. A number of these actions are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York, and that court has scheduled a trial of the claims brought by several merchants to begin in October 2025.
LIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from
various governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s
(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro
Interbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation of the Firm relating to
EURIBOR has been settled, and the Firm paid a penalty and costs of approximately 9million Swiss franc. The Firm
appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an
infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled
the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical
amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice of the European Union.
In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class
actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the
period that it was administered by the BBA, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York
granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the
defendants, including the Firm. The Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other
actions, and as to all remaining actions has moved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of
individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an
unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans
and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit in December 2024. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation. The
Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of certain assets. These
laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the
                                                        165                                                        
sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm cannot make
under, and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the
Firm and claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties’
contractual agreements concerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not
making payment. Russian courts have entered judgment against the Firm in a number of claims, including one for $
439million, and a judgment has been executed against assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of
the judgments exceeds the total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. The Firm continues to
appeal the Russian courts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian courts have also
ordered interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank accounts,
securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a determination
of certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts
and related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties’ contractual forum selections. If
further claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek
the proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and certain client assets could
also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. Shareholder Litigation .
Several shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf
of the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former
officers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the
precious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions
with the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a
resolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative
suits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and
unjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities
which were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion
to dismiss this action in full, and in April 2025 the appellate court affirmed the dismissal. A second shareholder
derivative action relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct was filed in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022. Defendants have moved to dismiss the
complaint. Zelle Network Litigation. In December 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) filed a
complaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (“EWS”), Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The CFPB alleged that EWS and the
defendant banks failed to take sufficient efforts to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. In March 2025, the Court
dismissed the complaint with prejudice at the request of the CFPB. * * * In addition to the various legal
proceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved
in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims
asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously.
Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves
for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP
for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal
proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or
downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal
expense was $ 121million and $( 72) million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. There
is no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the
inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very
large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual
outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines,
penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, based upon its current knowledge and
after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking
into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other
legal proceedings currently pending against it should not
                                                        166                                                        
have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in
light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of
these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have
material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to
JPMorganChase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss
or liability imposed and the level of JPMorganChase’s income for that period.

  Note 25 – Business segments & Corporate                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are threereportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking,
Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. The
business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and
they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose
members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures on page 67 for a definition of managed basis and Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s
business segments. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the reportable business
segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting
process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm
periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and
therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital
required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are
utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business
segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and
customers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or
businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.
Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income
and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to
Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics
of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in
the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of
net interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect
to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest
income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income. As a result of lower
average interest rates in the current period, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for
liabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is
transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and
CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the
transferred risk in its results. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is
referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are

Segment & Corporate results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the
three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with
the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm
(and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive
tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the
Firm’s managed basis.

(a) Segment managed results reflect revenue on an FTE basis with the corresponding income tax impact recorded
within income tax expense/(benefit). These adjustments are eliminated in reconciling items to arrive at the Firm’s
reported U.S. GAAP results.

(b) Excludes expense related to services provided by Corporate support units, which is allocated from Corporate to
each respective reportable business segment, as applicable, through noncompensation expense.

(c) Reflects occupancy; technology, communications and equipment; professional and outside services; marketing; and
other expense. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on other expense.

(d) Certain services are provided by Corporate and used by each of the reportable business segments. The costs of
these services, including compensation-related costs, are allocated from Corporate to the respective reportable
business segments, with the allocations recorded in noncompensation expense.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:
                                                                                                                   
  Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements                                                                
                                                                                                                   
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of March 31, 2025, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2025 and
2024, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “interim financial statements”).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the accompanying
interim financial statements for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2024, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and of cash
flows for the year then ended (not presented herein),
and in our report dated February 14, 2025, we
expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information
set forth in the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet information as of December 31, 2024, is fairly
stated, in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been
derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Credit derivatives : Financial instruments whose value
is derived from the credit risk associated with the
debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity)

transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference

Embedded derivatives: are implicit or explicit terms
or features of a financial instrument that affect some
or all of the cash flows or the value of the
instrument in a manner similar to a derivative. An
instrument containing such terms or features is
referred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid
that is the non-derivative instrument is referred to
as the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid
instrument that contains a plain vanilla debt
instrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option
that allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a
specified date for a specified amount (i.e., the
embedded derivative). However, a floating rate
instrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate
instrument and an interest rate swap.

The LTV ratio at the origination date of the loan.
Origination date LTV ratios are calculated based on
the actual appraised values of collateral (i.e., loan-
level data) at the origination date.

An estimate of the LTV as of a certain date. The
current estimated LTV ratios are calculated using
estimated collateral values derived from a nationally
recognized home price index measured at the
metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These
MSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to
the extent available and forecasted data where actual
data is not available. As a result, the estimated
collateral values used to calculate these ratios do
not represent actual appraised loan-level collateral
values; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are
necessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed
as estimates.

positions, as well as unused lines, related to the
property. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien
home equity products.

Mortgage product types :

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior
month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added
to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans
are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan
to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting
specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i)

unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV
ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a
history of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MREL : Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible
liabilities

earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards
programs generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate
for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM : Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and interest has been in default for a
period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both
well-secured and in the process of collection.
Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on
nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorganChase grants restricted stock and RSUs
to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant

Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum
capital requirements, defines eligible capital
instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market
discipline through disclosure requirements which allow
market participants to assess the risk and capital
profiles of banks.

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Preferred stock dividends: reflects dividends declared
and deemed dividends upon redemption of preferred
stock

Pre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the

ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue : Principal
transactions revenue is driven by many factors,
including the bid-offer spread, which is the
difference between the price at which the Firm is
willing to buy a financial or other instrument and the
price at which the Firm is willing to sell that
instrument. It also consists of realized (as a result
of closing out or termination of transactions, or
interim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of
changes in valuation) gains and losses on financial
and other instruments (including those accounted for
under the fair value option) primarily used in client-
driven market-making activities and on private equity
investments. In connection with its client-driven
market-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt
and equity instruments, derivatives and commodities
(including physical commodities inventories and
financial instruments that reference commodities).
Principal transactions revenue also includes certain
realized and unrealized gains and losses related to
hedge accounting and specified risk-management
activities, including: (a) certain derivatives
designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA : “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes
two comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual
fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-
adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star
rating is the best rating and represents the top 10%
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked
funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents
the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star
rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom
10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average
of the performance associated with a fund’s three-,
five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating
metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star
ratings are provided at the individual share class
level.

The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-
adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three
years of history are not rated and hence excluded from
these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star
rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The
performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd
quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile
rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset
values used to derive these rankings are sourced from
the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based
on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM
is based on fund performance and associated peer
rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled
funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent
the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong
Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all
share classes had been included. Past performance is
not indicative of future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.
