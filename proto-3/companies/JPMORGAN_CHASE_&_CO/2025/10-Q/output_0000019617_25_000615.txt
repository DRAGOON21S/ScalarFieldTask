(a) As of January 1, 2025, the benefit from the CECL
capital transition provision had been fully phased
out. For the period ended June 30, 2024, the ratios
reflected the CECL capital transition provisions.
Refer to Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and Note 27 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional
information.

(b) Reflects the Firm’s ratios under the Basel III
Standardized approach. Refer to Capital Risk
Management on pages 43-49 for additional information.

(c) NII and NIR refer to net interest income and
noninterest revenue, respectively.

(d) Markets consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and
Equity Markets businesses. The Firm assesses the
performance of its Markets business on a total net
revenue basis, as revenues in NII generally have
offsets across other revenue lines, primarily
Principal transactions revenue.

Comparisons noted in the sections below are for the

For the second quarter of 2025, JPMorganChase reported
net income of $15.0 billion, down 17%, with earnings
per share of $5.24, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 21%. The
Firm's results included a $774 million income tax
benefit in Corporate.

• Total net revenue was $44.9 billion, down 11%,
reflecting:

– Net interest income ("NII") was $23.2 billion, up
2%, driven by higher Markets net interest income,
higher wholesale deposit balances, higher revolving
balances in Card Services, and the

impact of investment securities activity including
from prior quarters. These factors were predominantly
offset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin
compression. NII excluding Markets was $22.8 billion,
down 1%.

– Noninterest revenue ("NIR") was $21.7 billion, down
21%, primarily reflecting the absence of the $7.9
billion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in
the prior year. Excluding this net gain, NIR would
have been up 11% driven by higher Markets noninterest
revenue, lower net investment securities losses in
Treasury and CIO, and increases in asset management

• Noninterest expense was $23.8 billion, flat when
compared with the prior year, driven by higher
compensation expense, including higher revenue-related
compensation and growth in the number of employees, as
well as higher brokerage expense and distribution
fees, higher auto lease depreciation, and continued
investments in technology. These factors were offset
by the absence of the $1.0 billion contribution of
Visa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded
in the prior year, as well as lower legal expense.

• The provision for credit losses was $2.8 billion.
Net charge-offs of $2.4 billion, predominantly in Card
Services, were up $179 million. The net addition to
the allowance for credit losses of $439 million,
primarily in wholesale, was driven by the impact of
net lending activity, largely offset by the impact of
changes in the Firm’s weighted-average macroeconomic
outlook, including a decrease in the weight placed on
the adverse scenarios.

In the prior year, the provision was $3.1 billion, net
charge-offs were $2.2 billion and the net addition to
the allowance for credit losses was $821 million.

• The total allowance for credit losses was $28.3
billion at June 30, 2025 . The Firm had an allowance
for loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of
1.85%, compared with 1.81% in the prior year.

Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and
Consolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 9-13 and
pages 14-15, respectively, for a further discussion of
the Firm's results, including the provision for credit
losses.

Pre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR
excluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed
basis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 17-18 for a
further discussion of each of these measures.

• The Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.5
billion at June 30, 2025 , up 24%, driven by:

– higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, largely related
to certain exposures in Technology, Media &
Telecommunications, Utilities, and Real Estate,
reflecting downgrades, and

– higher consumer nonaccrual loans, predominantly due
to the impact of the wildfires in California in
January 2025, as well as higher loans at fair value in
CIB.

Refer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer
Credit Portfolio on pages 64-72 and pages 60-63,
respectively, for additional information.

• Firmwide average loans of $1.4 trillion were up 5%,
predominantly driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM.

• Firmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up
6%, reflecting:

– net inflows related to client-driven activities in
Payments and Securities Services, and

– growth in balances in new and existing client
accounts in AWM,

partially offset by

– a decrease in CCB in existing account balances
primarily driven by increased customer spending and
migration into higher-yielding investments.

• CET1 capital was $284 billion, and the Standardized
and Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.1% and 15.2%,
respectively.

• SLR was 5.9%.

• TBVPS grew 11%, ending the second quarter of 2025 at
$103.40.

• As of June 30, 2025 , the Firm had eligible end-of-
period High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of
approximately $970 billion and unencumbered marketable
securities with a fair value of approximately $573
billion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of
liquidity sources. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management

Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB :

• higher debt underwriting fees primarily driven by
several large deals, and

• higher advisory fees predominantly benefiting from
increased sponsor activity,

partially offset by

• lower equity underwriting fees predominantly driven
by lower IPOs.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 26-33 and Note 5
for additional information.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting
in CIB:

• higher Fixed Income Markets revenue driven by higher
revenue in Rates, Commodities and Currencies &
Emerging Markets, largely offset by lower revenue in
Securitized Products and Fixed Income Financing,

partially offset by

• lower Equity Markets revenue, particularly in Prime
Finance.

Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has
offsets across other revenue lines, including net
interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of
its Markets business on a total net revenue basis.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 26-33 and Note 5
for additional information.

Lending- and deposit-related fees increased,
reflecting in CIB, a reduction in client credits
applied to deposit-related fees, as well as growth in
volumes resulting in higher cash management fees in
Payments.

Refer to CIB segment results on pages 26-33 and Note 5
for additional information.

Asset management fees increased in AWM and CCB, as a
result of net inflows and higher average market
levels. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages
21-25 and pages 34-38, respectively, and Note 5 for
additional information.

Commissions and other fees increased in CIB and AWM,
predominantly due to higher brokerage commissions and
fees on higher volume, and to a lesser extent, higher
custody fees as a result of higher client activity and
market levels. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on
pages 26-33 and pages 34-38, respectively, and Note 5
for additional information.

Investment securities losses decreased driven by lower
net losses in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate
results on pages 39-41 and Note 9 for additional
information.

Mortgage fees and related income : refer to Note 14
for additional information.

Card income : refer to CCB segment results on pages
21-25 and Note 5 for additional information.

Other income decreased, reflecting:

• the absence in Corporate of several items recorded
in the prior year, particularly the $7.9 billion net
gain related to Visa shares,

partially offset by

• higher auto operating lease income in CCB due to
growth in volume.

Refer to CCB and Corporate results on pages 21-25 and
pages 39-41, respectively, for additional information.

Net interest income increased driven by higher Markets
net interest income, higher wholesale deposit
balances, higher revolving balances in Card Services,
and the impact of investment securities activity
including from prior quarters. These factors were
predominantly offset by the impact of lower rates and
deposit margin compression.

Investment banking fees increased, reflecting in CIB :

• higher debt underwriting fees driven by several
large deals, and

• higher advisory fees, predominantly reflecting the
closing of a higher number of large transactions,

partially offset by

• lower equity underwriting fees driven by lower
convertible securities offerings and IPOs, largely
offset by higher follow-on offerings.

Principal transactions revenue increased, reflecting
in CIB:

• higher Fixed Income Markets revenue driven by higher
revenue in Rates and Commodities, predominantly offset
by lower revenue in Securitized Products, Fixed Income
Financing and Currencies & Emerging Markets, and

for additional information.

Card income was flat, and included in CCB, higher
amortization related to new account origination costs
and lower net interchange, largely offset by higher
annual fees.

Other income decreased, reflecting:

• the absence in Corporate of several items recorded
in the prior year, particularly the $7.9 billion net
gain related to Visa shares,

partially offset by

• the $588 million First Republic-related gain
recorded in the first quarter of 2025, and

• higher auto operating lease income in CCB due to
growth in volume.

Refer to Note 5, and Note 34 on pages 319-321 of the

The provision for credit losses was $2.8 billion. Net
charge-offs were $2.4 billion and the net addition to
the allowance for credit losses was $439 million.

Net charge-offs included $2.1 billion in consumer ,
predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting loan
growth, and $345 million in wholesale .

The net addition to the allowance for credit losses
consisted of:

• $446 million in wholesale , driven by the impact of
new lending-related commitments and changes in credit
quality of client-specific exposures, partially offset
by a decrease in the weight placed on the adverse
scenarios, and

• $3 million in consumer , as loan growth in Card
Services was offset by the impact of changes in the
Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook.

In the prior year, the provision was $3.1 billion, net
charge-offs were $2.2 billion and the net addition to
the allowance for credit losses was $821 million.

Compensation expense increased driven by:

• growth in the number of employees, primarily front
office and technology, and

• higher revenue-related compensation, particularly in
CIB and AWM.

Noncompensation expense decreased, reflecting:

• the absence in Corporate of the following items
recorded in the prior year

– a $1.0 billion contribution of Visa shares to the
JPMorgan Chase Foundation, and

– restructuring and integration costs associated with
First Republic, and

• lower legal expense, particularly in CIB,

partially offset by

• higher brokerage expense in CIB and higher
distribution fees in AWM,

• higher depreciation expense on higher auto operating
lease assets in CCB and

• higher investments in technology across the
businesses.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information on other
expense.

• lower FDIC-related expense, which included the
impact of a release of an FDIC special assessment
accrual of $323 million in Corporate recorded in the
first quarter of 2025, compared with an accrual
increase of $725 million in the first quarter of the
prior year,

partially offset by

• higher brokerage expense in CIB and higher
distribution fees in AWM,

• higher depreciation expense on higher auto operating
lease assets in CCB,

• higher investments in technology across the
businesses, as well as marketing, predominantly in
CCB, and

• higher occupancy expense.

Quarterly results

The effective tax rate decreased predominantly driven
by:

• a $774 million income tax benefit in Corporate,
driven by the resolution of certain tax audits and the
impact of tax regulations related to foreign currency
translation gains and losses finalized in 2024 and
effective for 2025, and

• other changes in the level and mix of income and
expenses subject to U.S. federal, state and local
taxes.

Cash and due from banks and deposits with banks
decreased driven by Markets activities in CIB, and
higher investment securities and cash deployment in
Treasury and CIO, largely offset by the impact of
higher deposits.

Federal funds sold and securities purchased under
resale agreements increased driven by Markets,
reflecting higher client-driven market-making
activities and the impact of lower levels of netting,
as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels
at year-end. Refer to Note 10 for additional
information on securities purchased under resale
agreements.

Securities borrowed : refer to Note 10 for additional
information .

Trading assets increased due to higher levels of debt
and equity instruments in Markets related to client-
driven market-making activities, as well as when
compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end.
Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional information.

Investment securities increased due to the net impact
of:

• higher available-for-sale ("AFS") securities,
reflecting net purchases, primarily U.S. Treasuries,
partially offset by maturities and paydowns, and

• lower held to-maturity (“HTM”) securities driven by
maturities and paydowns.

Refer to Corporate results on pages 39-41, Investment
Portfolio Risk Management on page 76, and Notes 2 and
9 for additional information.

Loans increased, reflecting:

• higher wholesale loans, primarily in Markets,
associated with higher client demand, and

• higher securities-based lending in AWM due to higher
client demand,

partially offset by

• a decline in Home Lending as loan sales and paydowns
outpaced originations.

The allowance for loan losses increased, reflecting a
net addition to the allowance for loan losses of $608
million, and consisted of:

• $443 million in consumer , predominantly driven by
Card Services, reflecting loan growth and the impact
of changes in the Firm's weighted-average
macroeconomic outlook, and

• $165 million in wholesale , driven by changes in
credit quality of client-specific exposures and the
impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average
macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by a reduction
due to the impact of charge-offs.

There was also an $831 million net addition to the
allowance for lending-related commitments recognized
in other liabilities on the Consolidated
                                                        14                                                         
balance sheets. The net addition was driven by the
impact of new lending-related commitments.

Refer to Consolidated Results of Operations and Credit
and Investment Risk Management on pages 9-13 and pages
58-76, respectively, Critical Accounting Estimates
Used by the Firm on pages 85-88, and Notes 2, 3, 11
and 12 for additional information on loans and the
total allowance for credit losses.

Accrued interest and accounts receivable increased
primarily due to higher client receivables related to
client-driven activities in CIB.

Goodwill, MSRs and other intangible assets : refer to
Note 14 for additional information .

Other assets increased primarily due to higher cash
collateral placed with central counterparties ("CCP")
in Markets, and higher auto operating lease assets in
CCB.

Deposits increased, reflecting the net impact of:

• an increase in CIB predominantly due to net inflows
related to client-driven activities in Securities
Services and Payments,

• an increase in CCB primarily driven by new accounts,
largely offset by a decrease in existing account
balances due to seasonal tax outflows and increased
customer spending, and

• a decrease in AWM driven by continued migration into
other investments and seasonal tax outflows,
predominantly offset by growth in balances in new and
existing client accounts, reflecting the impact of
higher-yielding product offerings.

Federal funds purchased and securities loaned or sold
under repurchase agreements increased driven by
Markets, reflecting higher secured financing of
trading assets, higher client-driven market-making
activities, and the impact of lower levels of netting,
as well as when compared with seasonally lower levels
at year-end.

Short-term borrowings increased driven by higher
financing requirements in Markets.

Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 for
additional information on deposits, federal funds
purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements, and short-term borrowings; and
Notes 2 and 15 for deposits; and Note 10 for federal
funds purchased and securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements.

Trading liabilities increased due to client-driven
market-making activities, which resulted in higher
levels of short positions, as well as higher
derivative payables, primarily as a result of market
movements. Refer to Notes 2 and 4 for additional
information.

Accounts payable and other liabilities increased due
to higher client payables related to client-driven
activities in CIB.

Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs :
Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 and
Notes 13 and 22 for additional information related to
Firm-sponsored VIEs and loan securitization trusts.

Long-term debt increased driven by net issuances of
structured notes in Markets due to client demand, as
well as an increase in the fair value of such
instruments, and net issuances of long-term debt in
Treasury and CIO, partially offset by lower Federal
Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") advances. Refer to Liquidity
Risk Management on pages 50-57 for additional
information.

Stockholders’ equity increased reflecting net income
and lower unrealized losses in AOCI, predominantly
driven by the net impact of lower interest rates and
widening spreads on cash flow hedges and AFS
securities in Treasury and CIO, largely offset by the
impact of capital actions, including net repurchases
of common shares and common and preferred stock
dividend payments. Refer to Consolidated statements of
changes in stockholders’ equity on page 94, Capital
Actions on page 47, and Note 19 for additional
information.

Operating activities • In 2025, cash used resulted from higher trading assets, higher accrued interest and accounts
receivable and net originations and purchases of loans held-for sale, partially offset by higher trading
liabilities. • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher trading assets and higher accrued interest and accounts
receivable, partially offset by higher trading liabilities and higher accounts payable and other liabilities.
Investing activities • In 2025, cash used resulted from higher securities purchased under resale agreements, net
loan originations and net purchases of investment securities. • In 2024, cash used resulted from higher securities
purchased under resale agreements and net purchases of investment securities.

Financing activities • In 2025, cash provided reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase
agreements, higher deposits, and net proceeds from long- and short-term borrowings. • In 2024, cash provided
reflected higher securities loaned or sold under repurchase agreements and net proceeds from long- and short-term
borrowings, partially offset by lower deposits and net redemption of preferred stock. • For both periods, cash was
used for repurchases of common stock and cash dividends on common and preferred stock. * * * Refer to Consolidated

  EXPLANATION AND RECONCILIATION OF THE FIRM’S USE  
  OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES                    
                                                    
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial
Statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP and this
presentation is referred to as “reported” basis; these
financial statements appear on pages 91-95.

In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a
reported basis, the Firm also reviews and uses certain
non-GAAP financial measures at the Firmwide and
segment level. These non-GAAP measures include:

• Firmwide “managed” basis results, including the
overhead ratio, which include certain
reclassifications to present total net revenue from
investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt
securities on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities (“FTE” basis). The
corresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt
items is recorded within income tax

expense. These adjustments have no impact on net
income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the
LOBs;

• Pre-provision profit, which represents total net
revenue less total noninterest expense;

• Net interest income, net yield, and noninterest
revenue excluding Markets;

• TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS; and

• Adjusted expense, which represents noninterest
expense excluding Firmwide legal expense.

Refer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 67–69 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of management’s use of non-GAAP financial
measures.

The following summary table provides a reconciliation
from the Firm’s reported U.S. GAAP results to managed
basis.

  BUSINESS SEGMENT & CORPORATE RESULTS  
                                        
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are three
reportable business segments – Consumer & Community
Banking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset &
Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in
Corporate.

The business segments are determined based on the
products and services provided, or the type of
customer served, and they reflect the manner in which
financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s
Operating Committee, whose members act collectively as
the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment
results are presented on a managed basis. Refer to
Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of
Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 17-18 for a
definition of managed basis.

Description of business segment reporting methodology

Results of the reportable business segments are
intended to present each segment as if it were a
stand-alone business. The management reporting process
that derives business segment results includes the
allocation of certain income and expense items. The
Firm periodically assesses the assumptions,
methodologies and reporting classifications used for
segment reporting, and therefore further refinements
may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also
assesses the level of capital required for each LOB on
at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide
various business metrics which are utilized by the
Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing
performance.

Revenue sharing

When business segments or businesses within each
segment join efforts to sell products and services to
the Firm’s clients and customers, the participating
businesses may agree to share revenue from those
transactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the
segment responsible for the related product or
service, with allocations to the other segments or
businesses involved in the transaction. The segment
and business results reflect these revenue-sharing
agreements.

Funds transfer pricing

Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which
the Firm allocates interest income and expense to the
LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary
interest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and
CIO.

The funds transfer pricing process considers the
interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of
assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.
Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized
in the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic
conditions and other factors, which may impact the
allocation of net interest income to the segments.
Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm
updated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits,
which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit
reflected within CCB’s net interest income that is
fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the
Firm’s net interest income.

As a result of lower average interest rates in the
current year, the cost of funding for assets and the
funding benefit earned for liabilities generally
decreased compared with the prior year.

Foreign exchange risk

Foreign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and
Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain
revenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these
risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign
exchange rate movements related to the transferred
risk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management
on pages 77-83 for additional information.

Capital allocation

The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and
Corporate is referred to as equity. At least annually,
the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to
allocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the
capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may
change. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity
on page 46, and page 104 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results –
Description of business segment reporting methodology
on pages 70–90 and Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for a further discussion of those
methodologies.

Net income was $5.2 billion, up 23%.

Net revenue was $18.8 billion, up 6%.

Net interest income was $14.4 billion, up 5%,
reflecting higher Card Services NII, predominantly
driven by higher revolving balances.

Noninterest revenue was $4.5 billion, up 11%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher auto operating lease income as a result of an
increase in volume, and

• higher asset management fees in Banking & Wealth
Management ("BWM"), reflecting higher average market
levels and net inflows,

partially offset by

• lower card income, driven by an increase in
amortization related to new account origination costs,
partially offset by higher annual fees. Net
interchange was relatively flat as the impact of
increased debit and credit card sales volume was
offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information on card
income and asset management fees; and Critical
Accounting Estimates on pages 85-88 for additional
information on the credit card rewards liability.

Noninterest expense was $9.9 billion, up 5%,
reflecting:

• higher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven
by higher auto lease depreciation on higher auto
operating lease assets, and continued investments in
technology and marketing, as well as

• higher compensation expense, primarily for bankers
and employees in technology.

The provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion. Net
charge-offs were $2.1 billion, up $22 million,
primarily driven by Card Services, reflecting loan
growth. The allowance for credit losses was relatively
flat, as the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-
average macroeconomic outlook, including a decrease in
the weight placed on the adverse scenarios, was offset
by loan growth in Card Services.

In the prior year, the provision was $2.6 billion, net
charge-offs were $2.1 billion and the net addition to
the allowance for credit losses was $579 million.

Refer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on
pages 58-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages
73-75 for a further discussion of the credit
portfolios and the allowance for credit losses.

Net income was $9.6 billion, up 6%.

Net revenue was $37.2 billion, up 5%.

Net interest income was $28.5 billion, up 4%, driven
by:

• higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by
higher revolving balances,

partially offset by

• lower NII in BWM, reflecting lower average deposit
balances.

Noninterest revenue was $8.6 billion, up 9%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher auto operating lease income as a result of an
increase in volume, and

• higher asset management fees in BWM, reflecting
higher average market levels and to a lesser extent,
net inflows,

partially offset by

• lower card income, reflecting an increase in
amortization related to new account origination costs
and lower net interchange, largely offset by higher
annual fees. Net interchange decreased as the impact
of increased debit and credit card sales volume was
more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner
payments.

Noninterest expense was $19.7 billion, up 5%,
reflecting:

• higher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven
by continued investments in technology and marketing,
higher auto lease depreciation on higher auto
operating lease assets, and higher operating losses,
as well as

• higher compensation expense, predominantly for
bankers and advisors, and employees in technology.

The provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion. Net
charge-offs were $4.2 billion, up $297 million,
primarily driven by Card Services, reflecting loan
growth. The net addition to the allowance for credit
losses was $471 million, predominantly driven by Card
Services, reflecting loan growth and the impact of
changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic
outlook.

In the prior year, the provision was $4.6 billion, net
charge-offs were $3.9 billion and the net addition to
the allowance for credit losses was $613 million.

billion, up 15%. Markets revenue was $8.9 billion, up
15%.

The following table summarizes selected income
statement data for the Markets businesses. Markets
includes both Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets.
Markets revenue consists of principal transactions,
fees, commissions and other income, as well as net
interest income. The Firm assesses its Markets
business performance on a total revenue basis, as
offsets generally occur across revenue line items. For
example, securities that generate net interest income
may be risk-managed by derivatives

that are reflected at fair value in principal
transactions revenue. Refer to Notes 5 and 6 for a
description of the composition of these income
statement line items. Refer to Markets revenue on page
81 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further
information.

For the periods presented below, the primary source of
principal transactions revenue was the amount
recognized upon executing new transactions.

Net income was $1.5 billion, up 17%.

Net revenue was $5.8 billion, up 10%. Net interest
income was $1.7 billion, up 4%. Noninterest revenue
was $4.1 billion, up 12%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.7 billion, up
11%, predominantly driven by higher asset management
fees reflecting strong net inflows and higher average
market levels.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $3.1 billion, up
9%, driven by:

• higher noninterest revenue as a result of higher
management fees due to strong net inflows and higher
brokerage fees, and

• higher net interest income, driven by higher average
deposits, largely offset by deposit margin
compression.

Noninterest expense was $3.7 billion, up 5%, driven
by:

• higher compensation, primarily revenue-related
compensation and continued growth in private banking
advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees,

partially offset by

• lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was $46 million,
compared with $20 million in the prior year.

Net income was $3.1 billion, up 20%.

Net revenue was $11.5 billion, up 11%. Net interest
income was $3.4 billion, up 7%. Noninterest revenue
was $8.1 billion, up 13%.

Revenue from Asset Management was $5.4 billion, up
13%, predominantly driven by higher asset management
fees, reflecting strong net inflows and higher average
market levels.

Revenue from Global Private Bank was $6.1 billion, up
9%, driven by:

• higher noninterest revenue, reflecting:

– higher management fees on strong net inflows, as
well as higher brokerage fees,

partially offset by

– a decline in the amortization of the fair value
discount on certain acquired lending-related
commitments associated with First Republic that have
expired, and

• higher net interest income driven by higher average
deposits and loans, partially offset by narrower
spreads on loans.

Noninterest expense was $7.4 billion, up 6%,
predominantly driven by:

• higher compensation, primarily revenue-related
compensation and continued growth in private banking
advisor teams, as well as higher distribution fees,

partially offset by

• lower legal expense.

The provision for credit losses was $36 million,
compared with a net benefit of $37 million in the
prior year.

billion in the prior year.

billion in the prior year.

impact of investment securities activity including
from prior quarters.

Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on page
19 for additional information on FTP.

and CIO.

Refer to Note 9 and Note 12 for additional information
on the investment securities portfolio and the
allowance for credit losses.

recorded in the first quarter of 2025.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information on the

accrual of $323 million recorded in the first quarter
of 2025, compared with an accrual increase of $725
million in the first quarter of the prior year, and

• the absence of the following items recorded in the

JPMorgan Chase Foundation, and

– restructuring and integration costs associated with

  FIRMWIDE RISK MANAGEMENT  
                            
Risk is an inherent part of JPMorganChase’s business
activities. When the Firm extends a consumer or
wholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their
investment decisions, makes markets in securities, or
offers other products or services, the Firm takes on
some degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is
to manage its business, and the associated risks, in a
manner that balances serving the interests of its
clients, customers and investors, and protecting the
safety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes
that effective risk management requires, among other
things: • Acceptance of responsibility, including
identification and escalation of risks by all
individuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk
identification, assessment, data and management within
each of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk
governance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a
disciplined and balanced compensation framework with
strong internal governance and independent oversight
by the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of
risk and control issues is carefully considered in the
Firm’s performance evaluation and incentive
compensation processes. Risk governance framework The
Firm’s risk governance framework involves
understanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and
impacts of risks. Refer to pages 91–95 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further
discussion of Firmwide risk management governance and
oversight.

  CAPITAL RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
Capital risk is the risk that the Firm has an
insufficient level or composition of capital to
support the Firm’s business activities and associated
risks during normal economic environments and under
stressed conditions.

Refer to pages 97–107 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K, Note 21 of this Form 10-Q and the Firm’s Pillar
3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are
available on the Firm’s website, for a further
discussion of the Firm’s capital risk management.

Basel III Overview

The capital rules under Basel III establish minimum
capital ratios and overall capital adequacy standards
for large and internationally active U.S. Bank Holding
Companies (“BHCs”) and banks, including the Firm and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. The minimum amount of
regulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks
is determined by calculating risk-weighted assets
("RWA"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-
balance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk.
Under the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive
approaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a
standardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and
an advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”).

For each of these risk-based capital ratios, the
capital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the
lower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches
compared to their respective regulatory capital ratio
requirements.

As of June 30, 2025, the Firm’s Basel III Standardized
risk-based ratios continue to be more binding than the
Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.

Additionally, Basel III requires that Advanced
Approaches banking organizations, including the Firm,
calculate their SLRs.

Refer to page 46 of this Form 10-Q and page 104 of
JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional
information on SLR.

  Enhanced SLR Proposal                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
In June 2025, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC"), and the FDIC
released a proposal to amend the enhanced
Supplementary Leverage Ratio (“eSLR”) requirements for
Global Systemically Important Banks (“GSIB”) BHCs and
their insured depository institution (“IDI”)
subsidiaries by revising the current static leverage
buffers at the BHC and IDI levels to 50 percent of the
parent GSIB’s U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge, which is
referred to as the “eSLR buffer.” In addition, the
proposal would make corresponding adjustments to the
leverage-based total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”)
and eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”)
requirements by replacing the current TLAC leverage
buffer with the eSLR buffer and replacing the current
static leverage-based eligible LTD requirement with a
requirement of 2.5% plus the eSLR buffer. Further, the
proposal would remove the eSLR threshold for an IDI
subsidiary of a U.S. GSIB to be considered “well
capitalized” under the prompt corrective action
framework and instead apply the eSLR as a capital
buffer requirement.

Refer to page 100 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K
for information on the U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge.
                                                                                                                   
  SCB Proposal                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
In April 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to
the calculation of the Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)
for large bank holding companies, including the Firm.
The proposal aims to reduce SCB volatility by using
the average of supervisory stress results from the
previous two annual stress tests to calculate the SCB.
The proposal would also modify the annual effective
date of the SCB from October 1 to January 1 and make
targeted changes to reporting requirements to
streamline data collection. The proposal would be
effective January 1, 2026.

(a) Excludes excise tax and commissions. The Board of Directors’ authorization to repurchase common shares is
utilized at management’s discretion. The common share repurchase program approved by the Board of Directors does
not establish specific price targets or timetables. Management determines the amount and timing of common share
repurchases based on various factors, including market conditions; legal and regulatory considerations affecting
the amount and timing of repurchase activity; the Firm’s capital position (taking into account goodwill and
intangibles); organic capital generation; current and proposed future capital requirements; and other investment
opportunities. The amount of common shares that the Firm repurchases in any period may be substantially more or
less than the amounts estimated or actually repurchased in prior periods, reflecting the dynamic nature of the
decision-making process. The Firm’s common share repurchases may be suspended by management at any time.

Capital planning and stress testing Comprehensive
Capital Analysis and Review On April 7, 2025, the Firm
submitted its 2025 Capital Plan to the Federal
Reserve. On July 1, 2025, the Firm announced that
under the current SCB framework, its preliminary
requirement provided by the Federal Reserve is 2.5%
(down from the current 3.3%), and the Firm’s
Standardized CET1 capital ratio requirement, including
regulatory buffers, is 11.5% (down from the current
12.3%). The Federal Reserve will provide the Firm with
its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2025 and that
requirement will become effective October 1, 2025
based on the current rules . Refer to page 43 for Key
Regulatory Developments related to proposed changes to
the SCB requirement. Refer to Capital planning and
stress testing on pages 97–98 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for additional information on CCAR. Other
capital requirements Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity The
Federal Reserve’s TLAC rule requires the U.S. GSIB
top-tier holding companies, including the Firm, to
maintain minimum levels of external TLAC and eligible
LTD. The following table presents the eligible
external TLAC and eligible LTD amounts, as well as a
representation of these amounts as a percentage of the
Firm’s total RWA and total leverage exposure. As of
January 1, 2025, the benefit from the CECL capital
transition provision had been fully phased out. The
period ended December 31, 2024 included the impact of
the CECL capital transition provisions.

  LIQUIDITY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                             
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Firm will be
unable to meet its cash and collateral needs as they
arise or that it does not have the appropriate amount,
composition and tenor of funding and liquidity to
support its assets and liabilities. For a further
discussion of the Firm's liquidity risk management,
refer to pages 108–115 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K and to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports,
which are available on the Firm’s website. LCR and
HQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA
that is sufficient to meet their respective estimated
total net cash outflows over a prospective 30
calendar-day period of significant stress. Under the
LCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone
100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not
transferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded
from the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for
both the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
required to be a minimum of 100%. The following table
summarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s
average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2025,
March 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024 based on the Firm’s
interpretation of the LCR framework.

(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Eligible HQLA securities
may be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment
securities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of calculating the LCR, HQLA securities are
included at fair value, which may differ from the accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. (c) Predominantly U.S.
Treasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of regulatory haircuts under the LCR rule.
(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank
affiliates.

The Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended June 30, 2025, compared with the three months ended
June 30, 2024, driven by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company and long-term debt
issuances, largely offset by common stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s
average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2025 decreased compared with the three months ended March 31, 2025,
due to an increase in loans and client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets, largely offset by an
increase in deposits. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2025 decreased
compared with the three months ended June 30, 2024, driven by loan growth and dividend payments to the Parent
Company, predominantly offset by higher deposits and client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets. Each of
the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their
respective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the
impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to pages 109-110 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal
stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and
its material legal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the
Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are produced on a daily basis, and other stress
tests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in
the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm manages liquidity at
the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to
comply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress
when access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.
                                                        50

In addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had
unencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and
debt securities, that the Firm believes would be
available to raise liquidity. This includes excess
eligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.
that are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The
fair value of these securities was approximately $573
billion and $594 billion as of June 30, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, respectively, although the amount
of liquidity that could be raised at any particular
time would be dependent on prevailing market
conditions. The decrease compared to December 31,
2024, was driven by a decrease in excess eligible HQLA
securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., largely
offset by an increase in unencumbered CIB trading
assets.

The Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4
trillion of available cash and securities as of June
30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. For each
respective period, the amount was comprised of
eligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of
regulatory haircuts, of approximately $970 billion and
$834 billion, and unencumbered marketable securities
with a fair value of approximately $573 billion and
$594 billion.

The Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the
FHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve
Banks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to
such banks of approximately $422 billion and $413
billion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
respectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the
benefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s
eligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that
are currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks
discount window and other central banks. Although
available, the Firm does not view this borrowing
capacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window
and the other central banks as a primary source of
liquidity.
                                                                                                                   
  NSFR                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
The net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity
requirement for large banking organizations that is
intended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable
funding that is sufficient to meet their “required”
amounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.

Management believes that the Firm’s unsecured and
secured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-
and off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both
short- and long-term cash requirements.

The Firm funds its global balance sheet through
diverse sources of funding including deposits, secured
and unsecured funding in the capital markets and
stockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding
source for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through
short- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance
of unsecured long-term debt, or from

borrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank
subsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term
unsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings
which are primarily securities loaned or sold under
repurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by
Treasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities
portfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term
liquid investments based on their interest rate and
liquidity risk characteristics.

Refer to Note 22 for additional information on off-
balance sheet obligations.

The Firm believes that deposits provide a stable
source of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on
the wholesale funding markets. A significant portion
of the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and
wholesale operating deposits, which are both
considered to be stable sources of liquidity.
Wholesale operating deposits are generally considered
to be stable sources of liquidity because they are
generated from customers that maintain operating
service relationships with the Firm.

The Firm believes that average deposit balances are
generally more representative of deposit trends than
period-end deposit balances. However, during periods
of market disruption, average deposit trends may be
impacted.

Average deposits increased for the three months ended
June 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended June
30, 2024, reflecting the net impact of:

• an increase in CIB due to net inflows related to
client-driven activities in Payments and Securities
Services, partially offset by net maturities of
structured notes in Markets,

• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances
in new and existing client accounts, including the
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, and

• a decrease in CCB in existing account balances
primarily driven by increased customer spending and
migration into higher-yielding investments, partially
offset by new accounts.

Average deposits increased for the six months ended
June 30, 2025 compared to the six months ended June
30, 2024, reflecting the net impact of:

• an increase in CIB due to net inflows related to
client-driven activities in Payments and Securities
Services, partially offset by net maturities of
structured notes in Markets,

• an increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances
in new and existing client accounts, including the
impact of higher-yielding product offerings, and

• a decrease in CCB in existing account balances
primarily driven by increased customer spending and
migration into higher-yielding investments, partially
offset by new accounts.

Period-end deposits increased from December 31, 2024,
reflecting the net impact of: • an increase in CIB
predominantly due to net inflows related to client-
driven activities in Securities Services and Payments,
• an increase in CCB primarily driven by new accounts,
largely offset by a decrease in existing account
balances due to seasonal tax outflows and increased
customer spending, and • a decrease in AWM driven by
continued migration into other investments and
seasonal tax outflows, predominantly offset by growth
in balances in new and existing client accounts,
reflecting the impact of higher-yielding product
offerings. Refer to the Firm’s Consolidated Balance
Sheets Analysis and the Business Segment & Corporate
Results on pages 14-15 and pages 19-41, respectively,
for further information on deposit and liability
balance trends. Refer to Note 3 for further
information on structured notes. Certain deposits are
covered by insurance protection that provides
additional funding stability and results in a benefit
to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be
available to depositors in the countries in which the
deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC provides
deposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a
U.S. depository institution. At June 30, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, Firmwide estimated uninsured
deposits were $1,555.5 billion and $1,414.0 billion,
respectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating
deposits.

The table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S.
and non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining
maturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S.
time deposits are based on data that the Firm
calculates periodically under applicable FDIC
regulations. For purposes of this presentation, all
non-U.S. time deposits are deemed to be uninsured.

  Short-term funding                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s primary source of short-term secured
funding is securities sold under agreements to
repurchase. These instruments are secured
predominantly by high-quality securities collateral,
including government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and
government agency MBS. Securities sold under
agreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2025,
compared with December 31, 2024, driven by Markets,
reflecting higher secured financing of trading assets,
higher client-driven market-making activities, and the
impact of lower levels of netting, as well as when
compared with seasonally lower levels at year-end.

The increase in secured other borrowed funds at June
30, 2025 from December 31, 2024, and for the average
three and six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to
the prior year periods, was due to higher financing
requirements in Markets.

The balances associated with securities loaned or sold
under agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due
to investment and financing activities of clients, the
Firm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of
the mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its
secured and unsecured financing (for both the
investment securities and market-making portfolios),
and other market and portfolio factors.

The Firm’s primary sources of short-term unsecured
funding consist of issuances of wholesale commercial
paper and other borrowed funds.

The decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2025 from
December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by strategic
short-term liquidity management.
                                                        55                                                         
                                                                                                                   
  Long-term funding                                                                                                
                                                                                                                   
Long-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term
funding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements,
including TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and
optimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal
long-term funding plan.

Unsecured funding and issuance

The significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to
provide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company
advances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external
counterparties. The increase in structured notes at June 30, 2025 from December 31, 2024, and for the average three
and six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the prior year periods, was primarily driven by net issuances of
structured notes in Markets due to client demand and an increase in the fair value of such instruments.

The following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 and Note 20 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.

(a) Includes long-term structured notes that are secured.

The Firm’s wholesale businesses also securitize loans for client-driven transactions; those client-driven loan
securitizations are not considered to be a source of funding for the Firm and are not included in the table above.
Refer to Note 14 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of client-driven loan securitizations.

  Credit ratings                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
The cost and availability of financing are influenced
by credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could
have an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to
liquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger
additional collateral or funding requirements and
decrease the number of investors and counterparties
willing to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude
of the impact of ratings downgrades depends on
numerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the
Firm

believes are incorporated in its liquidity risk and
stress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it
maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a
potential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings
downgrades.

Additionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs
and other third-party commitments may be adversely
affected by a decline in credit ratings. Refer to
Notes 4 and 13 for additional information.

The credit ratings of the Parent Company and certain
of its principal subsidiaries as of June 30, 2025 were

(a) On May 19, 2025, Moody’s announced that it had revised JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s outlook to stable from
developing, and that this change was related to Moody’s one-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer rating of the
U.S. Government announced on May 16, 2025. Moody’s also affirmed JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s long-term issuer
rating and revised J.P. Morgan SE’s outlook to positive; the previous outlook was negative with an "(m)" modifier,
reflecting a negative outlook for long-term bank deposits and a positive outlook for the long-term issuer rating.

Refer to page 115 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of the factors that could affect the credit
ratings of the Parent Company and the above subsidiaries.

(h) Represents the notional amount of protection obtained through the issuance of credit-related notes that
reference certain pools of residential real estate and auto loans in the retained consumer portfolio.

(i) Excludes mortgage loans past due and insured by U.S. government agencies, which are primarily 90 or more days
past due. These loans have been excluded based upon the government guarantee. At June 30, 2025 and December 31,
2024, mortgage loans 90 or more days past due and insured by U.S. government agencies were $113 million and $121
million, respectively. In addition, the Firm’s policy is generally to exempt credit card loans from being placed on
nonaccrual status, as permitted by regulatory guidance.

(j) Average consumer loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value were $22.1 billion and $17.3 billion for the three
months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively, and $20.3 billion and $16.2 billion for the six months ended
June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-off/(recovery) rates.

Portfolio analysis Loans increased from December 31,
2024 driven by higher residential real estate and auto
and other loans at fair value, predominantly offset by
lower retained residential real estate loans.
Residential real estate: The residential real estate
portfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at
fair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage
loans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans
decreased compared to December 31, 2024, driven by
paydowns, largely offset by originations. Retained
nonaccrual loans increased compared to December 31,
2024, primarily driven by forbearances granted to
certain borrowers impacted by the wildfires in Los
Angeles County, California in January 2025. Net
recoveries were lower for the three months ended June
30, 2025 compared to the same period in the prior
year, driven by the absence of loan sales in the
current quarter. Loans held-for-sale decreased from
December 31, 2024, reflecting loan sales. Nonaccrual
loans held-for-sale increased from December 31, 2024,
largely driven by transfers from retained loans in
anticipation of loan sales. Loans at fair value
increased compared to December 31, 2024, as purchases
outpaced sales in CIB and originations outpaced
warehouse loan sales in Home Lending. At June 30, 2025
and December 31, 2024, the carrying value of retained
interest-only residential mortgage loans was $88.6
billion and $88.9 billion, respectively. These loans
have an interest-only payment period generally
followed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully
amortizing payment period to maturity and are
typically originated as higher-balance loans to
higher-income borrowers. The credit performance of
this portfolio is comparable to the performance of the
broader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value
of retained home equity lines of credit outstanding
was $13.8 billion at June 30, 2025, including $3.6
billion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only
to fully amortizing payments or have been modified,
and $3.4 billion of interest-only balloon

HELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm
manages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving
period by reducing or canceling the undrawn line in
accordance with the contract or to the extent
otherwise permitted by law, including when there has
been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of
the borrower or significant decrease in the value of
the underlying property. The following table provides
a summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio
insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,
predominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair
value. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain
potential unrecoverable claim payments related to
government-insured loans and considers this exposure
in estimating the allowance for loan losses.

Auto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,
including loans at fair value, generally consists of
prime-quality scored auto and business banking loans,
other consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The
size of the portfolio increased when compared to
December 31, 2024, predominantly driven by an increase
in loans at fair value due to purchases of other
consumer unsecured loans in CIB. Net charge-offs
decreased for the three and six months ended June 30,
2025 compared to the same periods in the prior year,
primarily due to lower scored auto net charge-offs,
reflecting improved used vehicle valuations.

Total credit card loans were relatively flat, as
growth from new accounts and revolving balances was
offset by a decrease from seasonally higher loan
balances at December 31, 2024. The June 30, 2025 30+
and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.06% and 1.07%,
respectively, decreased compared to the December 31,
2024 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.17% and
1.14%, respectively, in line with the Firm's
expectations. Net charge-offs increased for the three
and six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the
same period in the prior year reflecting loan growth.

Consistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card
loans typically remain on accrual status until charged
off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses
includes the estimated uncollectible portion of
accrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to
Note 11 for further information about this portfolio,
including information about delinquencies.

  WHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO  
                              
In its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,
market-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating
services (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with
banks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on
the balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as
part of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale
portfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and
transaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.
Refer to the industry discussion on pages 66-69 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio
includes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. As of June 30, 2025, loans increased by
$62.7 billion, driven by higher loans in CIB, primarily in Markets, and higher securities-based lending in AWM,
both associated with higher client demand. Lending-related commitments increased by $28.2 billion, driven by higher
commitments in CIB. As of June 30, 2025, nonperforming exposure increased by $623 million, driven by Technology,
Media & Telecommunications, Utilities, and Oil & Gas, in each case resulting from downgrades, largely offset by
Real Estate, primarily due to upgrades, paydowns and charge-off activity, and Healthcare, resulting from charge-off
activity. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, wholesale net charge-offs were $532 million, predominantly in
Healthcare, Real Estate and Technology, Media & Telecommunications.

Wholesale credit exposure – maturity and ratings profile

The following tables present the maturity and internal risk ratings profiles of the wholesale credit portfolio as
of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Firm generally considers internal ratings with qualitative
characteristics equivalent to BBB-/Baa3 or higher as investment grade, and takes into consideration collateral and
structural support when determining the internal risk rating for each credit facility. Refer to Note 12 of
JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for further information on internal risk ratings.

(a) Loans held-for-sale are primarily related to syndicated loans and loans transferred from the retained
portfolio.

(b) These derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP.

(c) The notional amounts are presented on a net basis by underlying reference entity and the ratings profile shown
is based on the ratings of the reference entity on which protection has been purchased. Predominantly all of the
credit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management
activities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection
against certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.

(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally

The Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to
industries with actual or potential credit concerns.

Exposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized
exposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure,
excluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $48.5 billion and $44.7 billion as of June 30, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, representing approximately 3.6% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of
the $48.5 billion, $42.7 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by Oil & Gas,
predominantly due to a single new held-for-sale commitment, and Consumer & Retail, SPEs, and Banks & Finance
Companies, primarily resulting from downgrades, partially offset by Technology, Media & Telecommunications,
resulting from net portfolio activity and upgrades.

The table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The industry
of risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity. Refer to Note 4 of
JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on industry concentrations.

In its wholesale businesses, the Firm provides loans
to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate
and institutional clients to high-net-worth
individuals. Refer to Note 11 for a further discussion
on loans, including information about delinquencies,
loan modifications and other credit quality
indicators. The following table presents the change in
the nonaccrual loan portfolio for the six months ended
June 30, 2025 and 2024. Since June 30, 2024,
nonaccrual loan exposure increased by $1.2 billion,
largely driven by certain exposures in Technology,
Media, and Telecommunications, Utilities, and Real
Estate, in each case resulting from downgrades largely
offset by net portfolio activity.

  Lending-related commitments                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm uses lending-related financial instruments,
such as commitments (including revolving credit
facilities) and guarantees, to address the financing
needs of its clients. The contractual amounts of these
financial instruments represent the maximum possible
credit risk should the clients draw down on these
commitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations
under these guarantees, and the clients subsequently
fail to perform according to the terms of these
contracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees
have historically been refinanced, extended,
cancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a
default occurring. As a result, the Firm does not
believe that the total contractual amount of these
wholesale lending-related commitments is
representative of the Firm’s expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for
further information on wholesale lending-related
commitments.
                                                                                                                   
  Receivables from customers                                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Receivables from customers reflect held-for-investment
margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM
that are collateralized by assets maintained in the
clients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on
deposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable
debt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk,
the Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors
the required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and
requires clients to deposit additional cash or other
collateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.
Credit risk arising from lending activities subject to
collateral maintenance requirements is generally
mitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of
the activity, the fair value of collateral held and
the Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s
obligation to provide, additional margin when the fair
value of the collateral declines. Because of these
mitigating factors, these receivables generally do not
require an allowance for credit losses. However, if in
management’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses
is required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses
based on the value of the collateral and probability
of borrower default. These receivables are reported
within accrued interest and accounts receivable on the
Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets.

Refer to Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for
further information on the Firm’s accounting policies
for the allowance for credit losses.
                                                                                                                   
  Derivative contracts                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Derivatives enable clients and counterparties to
manage risk, including credit risk and risks arising
from fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange
and equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes
markets in derivatives in order to meet these needs
and uses derivatives to manage certain risks
associated with net open risk positions from its
market-making activities, including the counterparty
credit risk arising from derivative receivables. The
Firm also uses derivative instruments to manage its
own credit risk and other market risk exposure. The
nature of the counterparty and the settlement
mechanism of the derivative affect the

credit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-
the-counter ("OTC") derivatives, the Firm is exposed
to the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For
exchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures
and options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-
cleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to
the credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,
the Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures
arising from derivative contracts through the use of
legally enforceable master netting arrangements and
collateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s
OTC derivative transactions subject to collateral
agreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,
which are not typically covered by collateral
agreements due to their short maturity and centrally
cleared trades that are settled daily — was
approximately 86% at both June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024. Refer to Note 4 for additional information
on the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a
further discussion of derivative contracts,
counterparties and settlement types.

The fair value of derivative receivables reported on
the Consolidated balance sheets was $60.3 billion and
$61.0 billion at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
respectively. The decrease was primarily as a result
of market movements. Derivative receivables represent
the fair value of the derivative contracts after
giving effect to legally enforceable master netting
agreements and the related cash collateral held by the
Firm.

In addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and
other cash collateral that may be used as security
when the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the
Firm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of
liquid securities is consistent with the definition of
high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.

In management’s view, the appropriate measure of
current credit risk should also take into
consideration other collateral, which generally
represents securities that do not qualify as high
quality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits
of these additional collateral amounts for each
counterparty are subject to a legally enforceable
master netting agreement and limited to the net amount
of the derivative receivables for each counterparty.

The Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily
cash, G7 government securities, other liquid
government agency and guaranteed securities, and
corporate debt and equity securities) delivered by
clients at the initiation of transactions, as well as
collateral related to contracts that have a non-daily
call frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed
to return but has not yet settled as of the reporting
date. Although this collateral does not reduce the
receivables balances and is not included in the tables
below, it is available as security against potential
exposure that could arise should the fair value of the
client’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s
favor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on
the Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative
transactions.

Credit portfolio management activities The Firm uses
credit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in
its capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-
user, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated
with traditional lending activities (loans and
lending-related commitments) and derivatives
counterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale
businesses. In addition, the Firm obtains credit
protection against certain loans in the retained
wholesale portfolio through the issuance of credit-
related notes. Information on credit portfolio
management activities is provided in the table below.

  ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES  
                               
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management's estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm's financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm's
allowance for credit losses generally consists of: •
the allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s
retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and
is presented separately on the Consolidated balance
sheets, • the allowance for lending-related
commitments, which is reflected in accounts payable
and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance
sheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on
investment securities, which is reflected in
investment securities on the Consolidated balance
sheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The
allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2025 was
$28.3 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.4
billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to
the allowance for credit losses included: • $1.0
billion in wholesale , predominantly driven by changes
in credit quality of client-specific exposures, the
impact of new lending-related commitments, as well as
the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average
macroeconomic outlook, and • $444 million in consumer
, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting
loan growth and the impact of changes in the Firm's
weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. As of December
31, 2024, the Firm's qualitative adjustments and its
weighted-average macroeconomic outlook included
additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios to
reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks
related to the geopolitical and macroeconomic
environment. In the first quarter of 2025, the Firm
further increased the weight placed on the adverse
scenarios, and in the second quarter, the Firm
partially reduced the increase in weight implemented
in the first quarter. The Firm's allowance for credit
losses is estimated using a weighted average of five
internally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The
adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive
macroeconomic factors than the central case
assumptions provided in the following table, resulting
in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate
peaking at 5.9% in the second quarter of 2026, and • a
weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.0%
lower than the central case at the end of the fourth
quarter of 2026.

The following table presents the Firm’s central case
assumptions for the periods presented:

  INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO RISK MANAGEMENT  
                                        
Investment portfolio risk is the risk associated with
the loss of principal or a reduction in expected
returns on investments arising from the investment
securities portfolio or from principal investments.
The investment securities portfolio is predominantly
held by Treasury and CIO in connection with the Firm’s
balance sheet and asset-liability management
objectives. Principal investments are predominantly
privately-held financial instruments and are managed
in the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically
intended to be held over extended periods and,
accordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-
term realized gains with respect to these investments.
Investment securities risk Investment securities risk
includes the exposure associated with a default in the
payment of principal and interest. This risk is
mitigated given that the investment securities
portfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly
consists of high-quality securities. At June 30, 2025,
the size of the Treasury and CIO investment securities
portfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was
$742.8 billion, and the average credit rating of the
securities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based
upon external ratings where available, and where not
available, based primarily upon internal risk
ratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages 39-41
and Note 9 for further information on the investment
securities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer
to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 for
further information on related liquidity risk. Refer
to Market Risk Management on pages 77-83 for further
information on the market risk inherent in the
portfolio.

Principal investment risk Principal investments are
typically privately-held financial instruments
representing ownership interests or other forms of
junior capital. In general, principal investments
include tax-oriented investments and investments made
to enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business
strategies and exclude those that are consolidated on
the Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made
by dedicated investing businesses or as part of a
broader business strategy. The Firm’s principal
investments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and
are reflected within their respective financial
results. The Firm’s investments will continue to
evolve based on market circumstances and in line with
its strategic initiatives. The table below presents
the aggregate carrying values of the principal
investment portfolios as of June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024.

  MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT  
                          
Market risk is the risk associated with the effect of
changes in market factors such as interest and foreign
exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit
spreads or implied volatilities, on the value of
assets and liabilities held for both the short and
long term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages
141–149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a
discussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management
organization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring
and control, and predominant business activities that
give rise to market risk.

Models used to measure market risk are inherently
imprecise and are limited in their ability to measure
certain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision
may be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in
market conditions occur. For additional discussion on
model uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K.

Market Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s
existing market risk measures to identify
opportunities for enhancement, and to the extent
appropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly
over time.

Value-at-risk

JPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a
statistical risk measure, to estimate the potential
loss from adverse market moves in the current market
environment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used
as a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and
Regulatory VaR.

The Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming
a one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss
methodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.
For risk management purposes, the Firm believes this
methodology provides a daily measure of risk that is
closely aligned to risk management decisions made by
the LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market
risk measures, provides the appropriate information
needed to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates
separately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with
regulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to
derive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital
requirements under Basel III.

The Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling
techniques and measurements, and other factors. Such
changes may affect historical comparisons of VaR
results. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk
Management on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K for information regarding model reviews and
approvals.

Refer to page 143 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K
for further information regarding VaR, including its
inherent limitations, and the key differences between
Risk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to
JPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital
Disclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s
website, for additional information on Regulatory VaR
and the other components of market risk regulatory
capital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,
stressed VaR-based measure and the respective
backtesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages
146–149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further
information regarding nonstatistical market risk
measures used by the Firm.

The table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level. VaR can
vary significantly as positions change, market volatility fluctuates, and diversification benefits change.

(a) Divers ification benefit represents the difference
between the portfolio VaR and the sum of its
individual components. This reflects the non-additive
nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across
LOBs, Corporate, and risk types. For maximum and
minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful
as the maximum and minimum VaR for each portfolio may
have occurred on different trading days than the
components.

(b) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and
credit protection purchased against certain retained
loans and lending-related commitments, which are
reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR
does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is
not reported at fair value.

(c) Includes credit protection purchased against
certain retained loans and lending-related
commitments. This VaR does not include the retained
loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

(d) Includes a legacy private equity position which is
publicly traded, as well as Visa Class C common shares
which the Firm disposed of in the second and third
quarters of 2024.

(e) In the first quarter of 2025, the elevated average
and maximum VaR was due to a client-driven equity
position that has since matured.

Effective April 1, 2025, the Firm refined the
historical proxy time series inputs to one of its VaR
models to more appropriately reflect the risk exposure
from certain securitization warehousing loan
positions. With this refined time series, the average
Total VaR and each of the components would have been
lower by the amounts reported in the following table:

Quarter over quarter results Average total VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2025 decreased by $8 million,
when compared with March 31, 2025, due to the maturity of a client-driven equity position at the end of the first
quarter of 2025. Additionally, the decrease in average Total VaR arising from the Firm's refinement of the
historical proxy time series to one of its VaR models was offset by increases in the fixed income risk type. Year
over year results Average total VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2025 decreased by $14 million compared with
the same period in the prior year due to decreased Visa Class C common share exposure in Corporate VaR, partially
offset by market volatility in commodities.

The following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movements in the second

  VaR backtesting                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                   
The Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily
gains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below
do not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those
associated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk
management activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded
components of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The
definition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel
III capital rules.

A backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior
day. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent
with the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five
times every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the
statistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially
different from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.

For the 12 months ended June 30, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 167 of the 259 days, and observed 10
VaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 37 of
the 65 days, and observed four VaR backtesting exceptions.

The following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12
months and three months ended June 30, 2025. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the
corresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty
percentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one
hundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk
section of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR
applied to the Firm’s covered positions.

  Structural interest rate risk management                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
The effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s
reported net income is important as interest rate risk
represents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.
Interest rate risk arises not only from trading
activities which are included in VaR, but also from
the Firm’s traditional banking activities, which
include extension of loans and credit facilities,
taking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the
investment securities portfolio, and associated
derivative instruments.

One way that the Firm evaluates its structural
interest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.
Earnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate
exposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is
presented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which
includes net interest income and certain interest rate
sensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest
rates and, in the case of deposits, pricing
assumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes
to this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets
and liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other
currencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These
simulations primarily include retained and held-for-
sale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and
financing activities, investment securities, long-term
debt, related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer
pricing of other positions in risk management VaR and
other sensitivity-based measures as described on page
142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. These
simulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar
foreign exchange exposures arising from capital
investments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange
risk on page 149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
more information.

Earnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential
change to a baseline, over the following 12 months
utilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios
include a parallel shift involving changes to both
short-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a
steeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates
constant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter
yield curve involving increasing short-term rates and
holding long-term rates constant or holding short-term
rates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These
scenarios consider many different factors, including:

• The impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous
changes in interest rates from baseline rates.

• Forecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled
prepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding
assumptions about actions that could be taken by the
Firm or its clients and customers in response to
instantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment
assumptions are based on the interest rates used in
the scenarios compared with underlying contractual
rates, the time since origination, and other factors
which are updated periodically based on historical
experience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in
the Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects
certain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s
balance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening
and usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that
require management judgment. The amount of deposits
that the Firm holds at any given time may be
influenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as
broader monetary conditions and competition for
deposits.

• The pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as
deposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit
rates paid could change upon a given change in market
interest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ
from the modeled assumptions, primarily due to
customer behavior and competition for deposits.

The Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the
assumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,
including with respect to deposit betas and forecasts
of deposit balances, both of which are especially
significant in the case of consumer deposits. The
results of these sensitivity analyses are reported to
the CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically
evaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the
composition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in
market conditions, improvements in the Firm’s
simulation and other factors.

The Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures
of the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s
actual net interest income for the rate changes
presented may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios
are modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any
actions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients
or customers in response to rate changes. Other
significant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk
scenarios, including mortgage prepayments and deposit
rates paid, may also differ from actual results. The
Firm’s forecast for net interest income is included in
the Firm’s outlook on page 8.

(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates, including hedges of non-U.S. dollar
capital investments. Non-U.S. dollar sensitivities were insignificant. The change in the Firm’s sensitivities as of
June 30, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the net impact of Treasury and CIO actions,
partially offset by the impact of changes in Firmwide deposits. Treasury and CIO actions primarily consisted of an
increase in cash flow hedges of floating rate loans and in investment securities activity, both of which added
duration.

Economic value sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of
earnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures economic value sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the
longer-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily
retained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate
scenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions
for loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk
management policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the
EVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value measurement note to the Consolidated Financial
Statements. For example, certain assets and liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables
and deposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held
to maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 111 in Note 2.

The Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by
assessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to
changes in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on
page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other
sensitivity-based measures.

The table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-
sensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for
hedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged. The sensitivities disclosed in the table below may
not be representative of the actual gain or loss that would have been realized at June 30, 2025 and December 31,
2024, as the movement in market parameters across maturities may vary and are not intended to imply management’s
expectation of future changes in these sensitivities.

  COUNTRY RISK MANAGEMENT  
                           
The Firm, through its LOBs and Corporate, may be exposed to country risk resulting from financial, economic,
political or other significant developments which adversely affect the value of the Firm’s exposures related to a
particular country or set of countries. The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios
which may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified
given the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 150–151 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table
presents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2025 and their comparative
exposures as of December 31, 2024. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by
individual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including
client activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure
to Germany when compared to December 31, 2024 was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of
Germany predominantly due to higher client deposits. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to Russia, which
corresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of clients at the
Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to Russia is not
material. Refer to Note 24 on pages 184-185 for information concerning Russian litigation.

  CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES USED BY THE FIRM  
                                                  
JPMorganChase’s accounting policies and use of
estimates are integral to understanding its reported
results. The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates
require management’s judgment to ascertain the
appropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.
The Firm has established policies and control
procedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,
including any judgments made as part of such methods,
are well-controlled, independently reviewed and
applied consistently from period to period. The
methods used and judgments made reflect, among other
factors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and
the related business and risk management strategies,
which may vary across the Firm’s businesses and
portfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures
are intended to ensure that the process for changing
methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The
Firm believes its estimates for determining the
carrying value of its assets and liabilities are
appropriate. The following is a brief description of
the Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving
significant judgments.
                                                                                                                   
  Allowance for credit losses                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
The Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents
management’s estimate of expected credit losses over
the remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial
assets measured at amortized cost and certain off-
balance sheet lending-related commitments. The
allowance for credit losses generally comprises:

• The allowance for loan losses, which covers the
Firm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-
rated),

• The allowance for lending-related commitments, and

• The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities.

The allowance for credit losses involves significant
judgment on a number of matters including development
and weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,
incorporation of historical loss experience,
assessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk
ratings, valuation of collateral, and the
determination of remaining expected life. Refer to
Note 10 and Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K
for further information on these judgments as well as
the Firm’s policies and methodologies used to
determine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and
Allowance for credit losses on pages 73-75 and Note 12
of this Form 10-Q for further information.

One of the most significant judgments involved in
estimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses
relates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to
estimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast
period within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-

quarter forecast incorporates hundreds of
macroeconomic variables ("MEVs") that are relevant for
exposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses
being driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty
variables. The specific variables that have the
greatest effect on the modeled losses vary by
portfolio and geography.

• Key MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional
U.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.

• Key MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.
unemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.
interest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil
prices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S.
HPI.

Changes in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of
economic conditions could significantly affect its
estimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at
the balance sheet date or lead to significant changes
in the estimate from one reporting period to the next.

It is difficult to estimate how potential changes in
any one factor or input might affect the overall
allowance for credit losses because management
considers a wide variety of factors and inputs in
estimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in
the factors and inputs considered may not occur at the
same rate and may not be consistent across all
geographies or product types, and changes in factors
and inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such
that improvement in one factor or input may offset
deterioration in others.

To consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate
macroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled
credit losses determined using its central and
relative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are
two of the five scenarios considered in estimating the
allowances for loan losses and lending-related
commitments. The central and relative adverse
scenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but
differed in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of
those variables over the eight-quarter forecast
period.

For example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario
shown on page 73 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative
adverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment
rate, averaging approximately 1.8% higher over the
eight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of
approximately 2.4% in the second quarter of 2026.

This analysis is not intended to estimate expected
future changes in the allowance for credit losses, for
a number of reasons, including:

• The allowance as of June 30, 2025, reflects credit
losses beyond those estimated under the central
scenario due to the weight placed on the adverse
scenarios.
                                                        85                                                         
• The impacts of changes in many MEVs are both
interrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this
analysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe
changes in macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of
future changes in portfolio composition and borrower
behavior can significantly affect the allowance for
credit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of
credit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of
June 30, 2025, the Firm compared the modeled estimates
under its relative adverse scenario to its central
scenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated
effects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s
allowance for credit losses, the comparison between
these two scenarios for the exposures below reflect
the following differences: • An increase of
approximately $950 million for residential real estate
loans and lending-related commitments • An increase of
approximately $3.4 billion for credit card loans • An
increase of approximately $5.2 billion for wholesale
loans and lending-related commitments This analysis
relates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and
is not intended to estimate changes in the overall
allowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any
potential changes in other adjustments to the
quantitative calculation, which would also be
influenced by the judgment management applies to the
modeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the
uncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime
loss estimates based on then-current circumstances and
conditions. Recognizing that forecasts of
macroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the
Firm believes that its process to consider the
available information and associated risks and
uncertainties is appropriately governed and that its
estimates of expected credit losses were reasonable
and appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2025.

Fair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of its
assets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of
such assets and liabilities are measured at fair value
on a recurring basis, including trading assets and
liabilities, AFS securities, structured note products
and certain securities financing agreements. Certain
assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a
nonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home
equity and other loans, where the carrying value is
based on the fair value of the underlying collateral.
Assets measured at fair value The following table
includes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and
the portion of such assets that are classified within
level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 2

(a) For purposes of the table above, the derivative
receivables total reflects the impact of netting
adjustments; however, the $10.5 billion of derivative
receivables classified as level 3 does not reflect the
netting adjustment as such netting is not relevant to
a presentation based on the transparency of inputs to
the valuation of an asset. The level 3 balances would
be reduced if netting were applied, including the
netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Valuation
Details of the Firm’s processes for determining fair
value are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value
requires the application of judgment. The type and
level of judgment required is largely dependent on the
amount of observable market information available to
the Firm. For instruments valued using internally
developed valuation models and other valuation
techniques that use significant unobservable inputs
and are therefore classified within level 3 of the
fair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair
value are more significant than those required when
estimating the fair value of instruments classified
within levels 1 and 2.

In arriving at an estimate of fair value for an
instrument within level 3, management must first
determine the appropriate valuation model or other
valuation technique to use. Second, the lack of
observability of certain significant inputs requires
management to assess relevant empirical data in
deriving valuation inputs including, for example,
transaction details, yield curves, interest rates,
prepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,
correlations, prices (such as commodity, equity or
debt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,
foreign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to
Note 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of
level 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs
used.

For instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,
management judgment must be applied to assess the
appropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect
counterparty credit quality, the Firm’s
creditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity
considerations, unobservable parameters, and for
portfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of
the net open risk position. The judgments made are
typically affected by the type of product and its
specific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity
for the product or within the market as a whole. In
periods of heightened market volatility and
uncertainty judgments are further affected by the
wider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,
particularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer
to Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation
adjustments applied by the Firm.

Imprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs
or other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss
recorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while
the Firm believes its valuation methods are
appropriate and consistent with those of other market
participants, the methods and assumptions used reflect
management judgment and may vary across the Firm’s
businesses and portfolios.

The Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in
the determination of fair value. The use of
methodologies or assumptions different than those used
by the Firm could result in a different estimate of
fair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for
a detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process
and hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for
individual financial instruments.

  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  
                              
From time to time, the Firm has made and will make
forward-looking statements. These statements can be
identified by the fact that they do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts. Forward-
looking statements often use words such as
“anticipate,” “target,” “expect,” “estimate,”
“intend,” “plan,” “goal,” “believe,” or other words of
similar meaning. Forward-looking statements provide
JPMorganChase’s current expectations or forecasts of
future events, circumstances, results or aspirations.
JPMorganChase’s disclosures in this Form 10-Q contain
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. The
Firm also may make forward-looking statements in its
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC. In
addition, the Firm’s senior management may make
forward-looking statements orally to investors,
analysts, representatives of the media and others.

All forward-looking statements are, by their nature,
subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are
beyond the Firm’s control. JPMorganChase’s actual
future results may differ materially from those set
forth in its forward-looking statements. While there
is no assurance that any list of risks and
uncertainties or risk factors is complete, below are
certain factors which could cause actual results to
differ from those in the forward-looking statements:

• Local, regional and global business, economic and
political conditions and geopolitical events,
including geopolitical tensions and hostilities;

• Changes in laws, rules and regulatory requirements,
including capital and liquidity requirements affecting
the Firm’s businesses, and the ability of the Firm to
address those requirements;

• Heightened regulatory and governmental oversight and
scrutiny of JPMorganChase’s business practices,
including dealings with retail customers;

• Changes in monetary and fiscal policies and laws;

• Changes in trade policies, including the imposition
of tariffs and retaliatory responses;

• Changes in the level of inflation;

• Changes in income tax laws, rules and regulations;

• Changes in FDIC assessments;

• Securities and capital markets behavior, including
changes in market liquidity and volatility;

• Changes in investor sentiment or consumer spending
or savings behavior;

• Ability of the Firm to manage effectively its
capital and liquidity;

• Changes in credit ratings assigned to the Firm or
its subsidiaries;

• Damage to the Firm’s reputation;

• Ability of the Firm to appropriately address social,
environmental and sustainability concerns that may
arise, including from its business activities;

• Ability of the Firm to deal effectively with an
economic slowdown or other economic or market
disruption, including, but not limited to, in the
interest rate environment;

• Technology changes instituted by the Firm, its
counterparties or competitors;

• The effectiveness of the Firm’s control agenda;

• Ability of the Firm to develop or discontinue
products and services, and the extent to which
products or services previously sold by the Firm
require the Firm to incur liabilities or absorb losses
not contemplated at their initiation or origination;

• Acceptance of the Firm’s new and existing products
and services by the marketplace and the ability of the
Firm to innovate and to increase market share;

• Ability of the Firm to attract and retain qualified
employees;

• Ability of the Firm to control expenses;

• Competitive pressures;

• Changes in the credit quality of the Firm’s clients,
customers and counterparties;

• Adequacy of the Firm’s risk management framework,
disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting;

• Adverse judicial or regulatory proceedings;

• Ability of the Firm to determine accurate values of
certain assets and liabilities;

• Occurrence of natural or man-made disasters or
calamities, including health emergencies, the spread
of infectious diseases, epidemics or pandemics, an
outbreak or escalation of hostilities or other
geopolitical instabilities, the effects of climate
change or extraordinary events beyond the Firm's
control, and the Firm’s ability to deal effectively
with disruptions caused by the foregoing;

• Ability of the Firm to maintain the security of its
financial, accounting, technology, data processing and
other operational systems and facilities;

• Ability of the Firm to withstand disruptions that
may be caused by any failure of its operational
systems or those of third parties;

• Ability of the Firm to effectively defend itself
against cyber attacks and other attempts by
unauthorized parties to access information of the Firm
or its customers or to disrupt the Firm’s systems; and

• The other risks and uncertainties detailed in Part
I, Item 1A: Risk Factors in JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form
10-K.

Any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of
the Firm speak only as of the date they are made, and
JPMorganChase does not undertake to update any
forward-looking statements. The reader should,
however, consult any further disclosures of a forward-
looking nature the Firm may make in any subsequent
Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form
10-Q or Current Reports on Form 8-K.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”),
a financial holding company incorporated under
Delaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services
firm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The
Firm is a leader in investment banking, financial
services for consumers and small businesses,
commercial banking, financial transaction processing
and asset management. Refer to Note 25 for further
discussion of the Firm's reportable business segments.
The accounting and financial reporting policies of
JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.
GAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies
conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines
prescribed by regulatory authorities. The preparation
of the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements
requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of
contingent assets and liabilities. Actual results
could be different from these estimates. In the
opinion of management, all normal, recurring
adjustments have been included such that this interim
financial information is fairly stated. These
unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be
read in conjunction with the audited Consolidated
Financial Statements and related notes thereto
included in JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K.
Consolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements
include the accounts of JPMorganChase and other
entities in which the Firm has a controlling financial
interest. All material intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Assets held for
clients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm
are not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included
on the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm
determines whether it has a controlling financial
interest in an entity by first evaluating whether the
entity is a voting interest entity or a variable
interest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further
description of JPMorganChase’s accounting policies
regarding consolidation.

Offsetting assets and liabilities

U.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative
receivables and derivative payables with the same
counterparty and the related cash collateral
receivables and payables on a net basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable
master netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also
permits securities sold and purchased under repurchase
agreements and securities borrowed or loaned under
securities loan agreements to be presented net when
specified conditions are met, including the existence
of a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The
Firm has elected to net such balances where it has
determined that the specified conditions are met.
Refer to Note 1 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
further information on offsetting assets and
liabilities.

(a) At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, included total U.S. GSE obligations of $ 160.3billion and $
120.1billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.

(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net
realizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction
costs”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial
to the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical
commodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the
carrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost
basis is adjusted for changes in
                                                        99                                                         
fair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide
consistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each
period presented.

(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold
but not yet purchased (short positions).

(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as
a practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real
estate and other funds, were $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively, primarily reported in other assets.

(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level
3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.

Level 3 valuations

Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a
detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table
presents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the
weighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is
based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial
instruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be
validated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are
not included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial
instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value
hierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used
to value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the
weighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the
instruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic
average values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s
estimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and
the relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may
have similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied
volatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input
range and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-
parameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.

(a) The categories presented in the table have been aggregated based upon the product type, which may differ from
their classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation
technique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the
characteristics of the instruments can differ.

(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 365million, nonagency securities of $ 5million and
non-trading loans of $ 473million.

(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 14million, trading loans of $ 65million and non-trading loans of $
1.2billion.

(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 803million and non-trading loans of $ 559million.

(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are
financial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured
notes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are
broadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.

(f) Includes equity securities of $ 803million including $ 606million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are
not readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA
multiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and
in aggregate.

(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily
available, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed
assuming a par value of $ 100.

(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.

(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.

Changes in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of
the impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as
well as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range
of inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The
following tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)
for financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six
months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level
3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.
However, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,
observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);
accordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable
factors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3
financial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair
value hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or
losses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such
level 3 instruments.

Level 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets
since December 31, 2024, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and
liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 109 for further information on changes impacting
items measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and six months ended June 30, 2025 Level 3 assets were
$ 25.5billion at June 30, 2025, reflecting an increase of $ 1.3billion from March 31, 2025, and an increase of $
1.7billion from December 31, 2024. The increase for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was predominantly
driven by higher: • Gross derivative receivables of $ 1.4billion and $ 2.0billion, respectively, due to gains and
purchases primarily offset by settlements. Refer to the sections below for additional information. Transfers
between levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three months ended June 30, 2025
and 2024, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3 into level 2. For the six
months ended June 30, 2025, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 819million
and $ 1.0billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a
result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the six
months ended June 30, 2025, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 793million
and $ 904million of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a
result of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 1.1billion of
long-term debt driven by an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs for
structured notes. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included
the following: • $ 759million and $ 798million of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative
payables, respectively, as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of
unobservable inputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2
included the following: • $ 987million of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase in
observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. All transfers are based on changes in the
observability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the
quarterly reporting period in which they occur.

Gains and losses The following describes significant
components of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses)
for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring
basis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude
any effects of the Firm’s risk management activities
where the financial instruments are classified as
level 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to
Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements
rollforward tables on pages 102-107 for further
information on these instruments. Three months ended
June 30, 2025 • $ 1.6billion of net gains on assets,
predominantly driven by gains in net derivative
receivables due to market movements. • $ 2.7billion of
net losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by
losses in long-term debt due to market movements.
Three months ended June 30, 2024 • $ 682million of net
gains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net
derivative receivables due to market movements and
gains in MSR reflecting lower prepayment speeds on
higher rates. • $ 1million of net losses on
liabilities, driven by losses in deposits and short-
term borrowings predominantly offset by gains in
trading liabilities - debt and equity instruments and
long-term debt due to market movements. Six months
ended June 30, 2025 • $ 4.0billion of net gains on
assets, driven by gains in net derivative receivables
due to market movements. • $ 2.6billion of net losses
on liabilities, predominantly driven by losses in
long-term debt due to market movements. Six months
ended June 30, 2024 • $ 117million of net losses on
assets, driven by losses in net derivative receivables
due to market movements largely offset by gains in
loans due to market movements and gains in MSR
reflecting lower prepayment speeds on higher rates. •
$ 517million of net losses on liabilities, driven by
losses in long-term debt due to market movements.

Equity securities without readily determinable fair values

The Firm measures certain equity securities without readily determinable fair values at cost less impairment (if
any), plus or minus observable price changes from an identical or similar investment of the same issuer (i.e.,
measurement alternative), with such changes recognized in other income.

In its determination of the new carrying values upon observable price changes, the Firm may adjust the prices if
deemed necessary to arrive at the Firm’s estimated fair values. Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect
the different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the
Firm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.
The following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held
as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments
recorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are
included in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.

(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2024 was $ 3.7billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative
purchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.

(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and June 30, 2025 were $(

Included in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6million Visa Class B-2 common shares
("Visa B-2 shares") reflected in the Firm's principal investment portfolio at both June 30, 2025 and 2024.

These shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common shares
(“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters involving
Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5342at June 30, 2025 and may be adjusted by
Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the
effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of June
30, 2025, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be
terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations,
as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are
held at their nominal carryover basis.

Separately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative
instruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the
conversion rate. As of June 30, 2025, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 11.6million Visa B-2

(a) Fair value is typically estimated using a discounted cash flow model that incorporates the characteristics of
the underlying loans (including principal, contractual interest rate and contractual fees) and other key inputs,
including expected lifetime credit losses, interest rates, prepayment rates, and primary origination or secondary
market spreads. For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.
Carrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s
expected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and
carrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,
market liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying
value.
(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.
The majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the
Consolidated balance sheets. The carrying value and the estimated fair value of these wholesale lending-related
commitments were as follows for the periods indicated.

The Firm does not estimate the fair value of consumer off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. In many cases,
the Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments with or without notice to the borrower, as permitted by law, or in
accordance with the contract. Refer to page 183 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the
valuation of lending-related commitments.

The fair value option provides an option to elect fair value for selected financial assets, financial liabilities,
unrecognized firm commitments, and written loan commitments.

The Firm has elected to measure certain instruments at fair value for several reasons including to mitigate income
statement volatility caused by the differences between the measurement basis of elected instruments (e.g., certain
instruments that otherwise would be accounted for on an accrual basis) and the associated risk management
arrangements that are accounted for on a fair value basis, as well as to better reflect those instruments that are
managed on a fair value basis.

The Firm’s election of fair value includes the following instruments:

• Loans purchased or originated as part of securitization warehousing activity, subject to bifurcation accounting,
or managed on a fair value basis, including lending-related commitments

• Certain securities financing agreements

• Owned beneficial interests in securitized financial assets that contain embedded credit derivatives, which would
otherwise be required to be separately accounted for as a derivative instrument

• Structured notes and other hybrid instruments, which are predominantly financial instruments that contain
embedded derivatives, that are issued or transacted as part of client-driven activities

• Certain long-term beneficial interests issued by CIB’s consolidated securitization trusts where the underlying
assets are carried at fair value

Changes in fair value under the fair value option election
The following table presents the changes in fair value included in the Consolidated statements of income for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, for items for which the fair value option was elected. The
profit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be
measured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be measured at fair value, are
not included in the table.

(a) Unrealized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk (DVA) for liabilities for which the fair value
option has been elected are recorded in OCI, while realized gains/(losses) are recorded in principal transactions
revenue. Realized gains/(losses) due to instrument-specific credit risk recorded in principal transactions revenue
were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.

(b) Long-term debt measured at fair value predominantly relates to structured notes. Although the risk associated
with the structured notes is actively managed, the gains/(losses) reported in this table do not include the income
statement impact of the risk management instruments used to manage such risk.

(c) Reported in mortgage fees and related income.

(d) Reported in other income.

(e) Changes in fair value exclude contractual interest, which is included in interest income and interest expense
for all instruments other than certain hybrid financial instruments in CIB. Refer to Note 6 for further information
regarding interest income and interest expense.

The following table reflects the difference between the aggregate fair value and the aggregate remaining
contractual principal balance outstanding as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, for loans, long-term debt and
long-term beneficial interests for which the fair value option has been elected.

(a) These balances are excluded from nonaccrual loans as the loans are insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government
agencies.
(b) There were noperforming loans that were ninety days or more past due as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
(c) Includes loans insured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies less than 90 days past due.
(d) Remaining contractual principal is not applicable to nonprincipal-protected structured notes and long-term
beneficial interests. Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the
Firm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and
long-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for
structured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature
embedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both
nonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.
(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual
principal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.
At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair
value option was elected was $ 14.5billion and $ 12.2billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(
6) million and $ 50million, respectively. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K, and Note 22 of this
Form 10-Q for further information regarding off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments.

JPMorganChase makes markets in derivatives for clients and also uses derivatives to hedge or manage its own risk
exposures. Refer to Note 5 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s use of and
accounting policies regarding derivative instruments. The Firm’s disclosures are based on the accounting treatment
and purpose of these derivatives. A limited number of the Firm’s derivatives are designated in hedge accounting
relationships and are disclosed according to the type of hedge (fair value hedge, cash flow hedge, or net
investment hedge). Derivatives not designated in hedge accounting relationships include certain derivatives that
are used to manage risks associated with specified assets and liabilities (“specified risk management” positions)
as well as derivatives used in the Firm’s market-making businesses or for other purposes.
The following table outlines the Firm’s primary uses of derivatives and the related hedge accounting designation or
disclosure category.

(a) Refer to the Credit derivatives discussion on
pages 127-128 for more information on volumes and
types of credit derivative contracts.
(b) Represents the sum of gross long and gross short
third-party notional derivative contracts.
While the notional amounts disclosed above give an
indication of the volume of the Firm’s derivatives
activity, the notional amounts significantly exceed,
in the Firm’s view, the possible losses that could
arise from such transactions. For most derivative
contracts, the notional amount is not exchanged; it is
simply a reference amount used to calculate payments.

(a) Balances exclude structured notes for which the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 3 for further
information.
(b) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and
the related cash collateral receivables and payables when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists.
                                                        118                                                        
Derivatives netting
The following tables present, as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, gross and net derivative receivables and
payables by contract and settlement type. Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash
collateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has
obtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has
not been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and
those derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables.
In addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative
receivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).
These amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not
eligible for net presentation:
• collateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are
shown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables, up to the fair
value exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with
the definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;
• the amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty
level, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and
• collateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal
opinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from
the tables.

(a) Exchange-traded derivative balances that relate to futures contracts are settled daily.
(b) Includes liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians related to derivative
instruments where an appropriate legal opinion has been obtained. For some counterparties, the collateral amounts
of financial instruments may exceed the derivative receivables and derivative payables balances. Where this is the
case, the total amount reported is limited to the net derivative receivables and net derivative payables balances
with that counterparty.
(c) Derivative collateral relates only to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative instruments.
(d) Net derivatives receivable included cash collateral netted of $ 50.0billion and $ 51.9billion at June 30, 2025
and December 31, 2024, respectively. Net derivatives payable included cash collateral netted of $ 57.8billion and $
60.8billion at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. Derivative cash collateral relates to OTC and
OTC-cleared derivative instruments.

The following table shows the impact of a single-notch and two-notch downgrade of the long-term issuer ratings of
JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries, predominantly JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., at June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024, related to OTC and OTC-cleared derivative contracts with contingent collateral or termination features
that may be triggered upon a ratings downgrade. Derivatives contracts generally require additional collateral to be
posted or terminations to be triggered when the predefined rating threshold is breached. A downgrade by a single
rating agency that does not result in a rating lower than a preexisting corresponding rating provided by another
major rating agency will generally not result in additional collateral (except in certain instances in which
additional initial margin may be required upon a ratings downgrade), nor in termination payment requirements. The
liquidity impact in the table is calculated based upon a downgrade below the lowest current rating of the rating
agencies referred to in the derivative contract.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of the benchmark (e.g., Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”)) interest rate
risk of fixed-rate long-term debt and AFS securities. Gains and losses were recorded in net interest income.
(b) Includes the amortization of income/expense associated with the inception hedge accounting adjustment applied
to the hedged item. Excludes the accrual of interest on interest rate swaps and the related hedged items.
(c) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of long-term debt and AFS securities for changes in
spot foreign currency rates. Gains and losses related to the derivatives and the hedged items due to changes in
foreign currency rates and the income statement impact of excluded components were recorded primarily in principal
transactions revenue and net interest income.
(d) Consists of overall fair value hedges of physical commodities inventories that are generally carried at the
lower of cost or net realizable value (net realizable value approximates fair value). Gains and losses were
recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(e) The assessment of hedge effectiveness excludes certain components of the changes in fair values of the
derivatives and hedged items such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts, time values and cross-
currency basis spreads. Excluded components may impact earnings either through amortization of the initial amount
over the life of the derivative, or through fair value changes recognized in the current period.
(f) Represents the change in value of amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness under the amortization
approach, predominantly cross-currency basis spreads. The amount excluded at inception of the hedge is recognized
in earnings over the life of the derivative.

As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated balance sheets

statement in future periods as an adjustment to yield.

(a) Excludes physical commodities with a carrying value of $ 7.8billion and $ 6.2billion at June 30, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, respectively, to which the Firm applies fair value hedge accounting. As a result of the
application of hedge accounting, these inventories are carried at fair value, thus recognizing unrealized gains and
losses in current periods. Since the Firm exits these positions at fair value, there is no incremental impact to
net income in future periods.
(b) Excludes hedged items where only foreign currency risk is the designated hedged risk, as basis adjustments
related to foreign currency hedges will not reverse through the income statement in future periods. At June 30,
2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying amount excluded for AFS securities was $ 31.3billion and $ 28.7billion,
respectively. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying amount excluded for long-term debt was $
589million and $ 518million, respectively.
(c) Carrying amount represents the amortized cost, net of allowance if applicable. At June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024, the amortized cost of the portfolio layer method closed portfolios was $ 102.5billion and $ 72.8billion,
of which $ 70.3billion and $ 41.2billion was designated as hedged, respectively. The amount designated as hedged is
the sum of the notional amounts of all outstanding layers in each portfolio, which includes both spot starting and
forward starting layers. At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the cumulative amount of basis adjustments was $
157million and $( 1.7) billion, which is comprised of $ 1.1billion and $( 1.2) billion for active hedging
relationships, and $( 936) million and $( 566) million for discontinued hedging relationships, respectively. Refer
to Note 9 for additional information.
(d) Positive (negative) amounts related to assets represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will
reduce (increase) net interest income in future periods. Positive (negative) amounts related to liabilities
represent cumulative fair value hedge basis adjustments that will increase (reduce) net interest income in future
periods.

Cash flow hedge gains and losses
The following tables present derivative instruments, by contract type, used in cash flow hedge accounting
relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such derivatives, for the three and six months ended June
30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. The Firm includes the gains/(losses) on the hedging derivative in the same line
item in the Consolidated statements of income as the change in cash flows on the related hedged item.

(a) Primarily consists of hedges of SOFR-indexed floating-rate assets. Gains and losses were recorded in net
interest income.
(b) Primarily consists of hedges of the foreign currency risk of non-U.S. dollar-denominated revenue and expense.
The income statement classification of gains and losses follows the hedged item – primarily noninterest revenue and
compensation expense.

The Firm did not experience any forecasted transactions that failed to occur for the three months ended June 30,
2025 and 2024.

Over the next 12 months, the Firm expects that approximately $( 1.3) billion (after-tax) of net losses recorded in
AOCI at June 30, 2025, related to cash flow hedges will be recognized in income. For cash flow hedges that have
been terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized
in earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash
flows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is
approximately ten years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing
activities.

(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts. The changes in fair value of these
amounts are recorded in net interest income.
(b) Excludes amounts reclassified from AOCI to income associated with net investment hedges. There were no sales or
liquidations of legal entities that resulted in reclassifications for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025.
During the three and six months ended June 30, 2024, the Firm reclassified a net pre-tax gain of $ 10million to
other income. Refer to Note 19 for further information.

(a) Primarily represents interest rate derivatives used to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in mortgage
commitments, warehouse loans and MSRs, as well as written commitments to originate warehouse loans. Gains and
losses were recorded predominantly in mortgage fees and related income.
(b) Relates to credit derivatives used to mitigate credit risk associated with lending exposures in the Firm’s
wholesale businesses. These derivatives do not include credit derivatives used to mitigate counterparty credit risk
arising from derivative receivables, which is included in gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making
activities and other derivatives. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(c) Primarily relates to derivatives used to mitigate foreign exchange risk of specified foreign currency-
denominated assets and liabilities. Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
(d) Gains and losses were recorded in principal transactions revenue.
Gains and losses on derivatives related to market-making activities and other derivatives The Firm makes markets in
derivatives in order to meet the needs of customers and uses derivatives to manage certain risks associated with
net open risk positions from its market-making activities, including the counterparty credit risk arising from
derivative receivables. All derivatives not included in the hedge accounting or specified risk management
categories above are included in this category. Gains and losses on these derivatives are primarily recorded in
principal transactions revenue. Refer to Note 5 for information on principal transactions revenue.

Credit derivatives

Refer to Note 5 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a more detailed discussion of credit derivatives. The
following tables present a summary of the notional amounts of credit derivatives and credit-related notes the Firm
sold and purchased as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit
derivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not
take into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference
obligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks
associated with such derivatives.

(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.

(b) Predominantly represents Other protection purchased by CIB.

(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is
identical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each
individual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection
sold.

(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would
generally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement
value.

(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where
the Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument. Also includes credit protection against
certain loans and lending-related commitments in the retained lending portfolio through the issuance of credit
derivatives and credit-related notes.

The following tables summarize the notional amounts by the ratings, maturity profile, and total fair value, of
credit derivatives as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, where JPMorganChase is the seller of protection. The
maturity profile is based on the remaining contractual maturity of the credit derivative contracts. The ratings
profile is based on the rating of the reference entity on which the credit derivative contract is based. The
ratings and maturity profile of credit derivatives where JPMorganChase is the purchaser of protection are
comparable to the profile reflected below.

portfolio consisted of debt securities with an average credit rating of AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily upon internal risk ratings). Refer to Note 10 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information regarding the investment securities portfolio.

and government agency MBS with unrealized losses of $ 3.2billion and $ 5.3billion, at June 30, 2025 and December
31, 2024, respectively; changes in the value of these securities are generally driven by changes in interest rates
rather than changes in their credit profile given the explicit or implicit guarantees provided by the U.S.
government.

HTM securities – credit risk Credit quality indicator
The primary credit quality indicator for HTM
securities is the risk rating assigned to each
security. At both June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
all HTM securities were rated investment grade and
were current and accruing, with approximately 99%
rated at least AA+ (based upon external ratings where
available, and where not available, based primarily
upon internal risk ratings).

Allowance for credit losses on investment securities
The allowance for credit losses on investment
securities as of June 30, 2025 was $ 108million, which
included the impact of a $ 17million reduction in
allowance related to a sale of a corporate debt
security in the first quarter of 2025. As of June 30,
2024, the allowance for credit losses in investment
securities was $ 177million. Refer to Note 10 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further discussion
of accounting policies for AFS and HTM securities.

(a) Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted
based on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of
premiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio
hedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal
prepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected
maturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield
is calculated to the earliest call date.
(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for
credit losses of $ 35million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $ 1.1billion at June 30,
2025. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $
73million at June 30, 2025.
(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years
or more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future
prepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, six yearsfor agency residential collateralized

Refer to Note 11 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities
financing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which
the fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and
collateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the
Firm’s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. When the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant
netting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances
outstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges
securities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but
such collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an
appropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with
securities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in
the table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”
presented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are
presented gross in the “Net amounts” below. In transactions where the Firm is acting as the lender in a securities-
for-securities lending agreement and receives securities that can be pledged or sold as collateral, the Firm
recognizes the securities received at fair value within other assets and the obligation to return those securities
within accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Transfers not qualifying for sale accounting

At June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the Firm held $ 936million and $ 805million, respectively, of financial
assets for which the rights have been transferred to third parties; however, the transfers did not qualify as a
sale in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These transfers have been recognized as collateralized financing transactions.
The transferred assets are recorded in trading assets and loans, and the corresponding liabilities are recorded
primarily in short-term borrowings and long-term debt on the Consolidated balance sheets.

Loan accounting framework

The accounting for a loan depends on management’s strategy for the loan. The Firm accounts for loans based on the
following categories:

• Originated or purchased loans held-for-investment (i.e., “retained”)

• Loans held-for-sale

• Loans at fair value

Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for a detailed discussion of loans, including accounting
policies. Refer to Note 3 of this Form 10-Q for further information on the Firm's elections of fair value
accounting under the fair value option. Refer to Note 2 of this Form 10-Q for information on loans carried at fair
value and classified as trading assets.

Loan portfolio
The Firm’s loan portfolio is divided into threeportfolio segments, which are the same segments used by the Firm to
determine the allowance for loan losses: Consumer, excluding credit card; Credit card; and Wholesale. Within each
portfolio segment the Firm monitors and assesses the credit risk in the following classes of loans, based on the
risk characteristics of each loan class.

(a) Includes scored mortgage and home equity loans held in CCB and AWM, and scored mortgage loans held in CIB.
(b) Includes scored auto, business banking and consumer unsecured loans as well as overdrafts, primarily in CCB.
(c) Includes loans held in CIB, AWM, Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale
methodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses.
(d) The wholesale portfolio segment's classes align with loan classifications as defined by the Federal Reserve
Board ("FRB") in effect at each period presented, based on the loan's collateral, purpose, and type of borrower.
(e) Includes loans to financial institutions, SPEs, personal investment companies and trusts, individuals and
individual entities (predominantly Global Private Bank clients within AWM and J.P. Morgan Wealth Management within
CCB), states and political subdivisions, as well as loans to nonprofits. Refer to Note 14 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for more information on SPEs.

(a) Individual delinquency classifications include mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies which were
not material at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

(b) Excludes mortgage loans that are 30 or more days past due insured by U.S. government agencies which were not
material at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. These amounts have been excluded based upon the government
guarantee.

(c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.

Approximately 38% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.
The lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have
been converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.
That is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than
the minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.

(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the
underlying collateral less costs to sell. The Firm reports, in accordance with regulatory guidance, residential
real estate loans that have been discharged under Chapter 7 bankruptcy and not reaffirmed by the borrower (“Chapter
7 loans”) as collateral-dependent nonaccrual loans, regardless of their delinquency status. At June 30, 2025,
approximately 8% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.

(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at June 30,
2025 and December 31, 2024.

(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 37million and $ 42million and $ 74million
and $ 85million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.

(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.
Current property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally
recognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers
all available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.

(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at
least a quarterly basis.

(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.
These loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.

(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.

(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at June 30, 2025.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of residential
real estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty. The Firm's proprietary modification
programs as well as government programs, including
U.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various
modifications to borrowers experiencing financial
difficulty including, but not limited to, interest
rate reductions, term extensions, other-than-
insignificant payment deferral and principal
forgiveness that would otherwise have been required
under the terms of the original agreement, are
considered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's
2024 Form 10-K for further information. Financial
effects of FDMs For the three and six months ended
June 30, 2025, retained residential real estate FDMs
were $ 923million and $ 977million, respectively,
which included $ 887million and $ 902million,
respectively, of FDMs in the form of other-than-
insignificant payment deferrals. These other-than-
insignificant payment deferrals were driven by
forbearances granted to certain borrowers impacted by
the wildfires in Los Angeles County, California in
January 2025 who were granted a second 90-day
forbearance arrangement. The financial effects of the
remaining FDMs, which were in the form of term
extensions and interest rate reductions, included
extending the weighted-average life of the loans by
15and 16years, and reducing the weighted-average
contractual interest rate from 7.17% to 5.65% and
7.25% to 5.82% for the three and six months ended June
30, 2025. For the three and six months ended June 30,
2024, retained residential real estate FDMs were $
68million and $ 98million, respectively. The financial
effects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the
form of term extensions and interest rate reductions,
included extending the weighted-average life of the
loans by 7and 10years, and reducing the weighted-
average contractual interest rate from 7.59% to 6.04%
and 7.58% to 5.50% for the three and six months ended
June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, additional
unfunded commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing
financial difficulty whose loans have been modified as
FDMs were not material, while there were noadditional
unfunded commitments as of December 31, 2024. For the
three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024,
loans subject to a trial modification, where the terms
of the loans have not been permanently modified, and
Chapter 7 loans were not material.

Defaults of FDMs Retained residential real estate FDMs
that defaulted during the three and six months ended
June 30, 2025 and 2024 and were reported as FDMs in
the twelve months prior to the default were not
material. Active and suspended foreclosure At June 30,
2025 and December 31, 2024, the Firm had retained
residential real estate loans, excluding those insured
by U.S. government agencies, with a carrying value of
$ 547million and $ 576million, respectively, that were
not included in REO, but were in the process of active
or suspended foreclosure.

(a) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain
nonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or
the fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral
improves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.

(b) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was not material for the three and six months
ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 .

(c) The geographic regions presented in this table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan
balances at June 30, 2025.

Loan modifications

The Firm grants certain modifications of credit card loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. These
modifications may involve placing the customer’s credit card account on a fixed payment plan, generally for
60months, which typically includes reducing the interest rate on the credit card account. If the borrower does not
make the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and
will be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not
reinstate the borrower's line of credit.

Defaults of FDMs

Retained credit card FDMs that defaulted during the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024 and were
reported as FDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were not material.

For credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses
twoconsecutive contractual payments. Defaulted modified credit card loans remain in the modification program and
continue to be charged off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy.

Wholesale loan portfolio

Wholesale loans include loans made to a variety of clients, ranging from large corporate and institutional clients
to small businesses and high-net-worth individuals. The primary credit quality indicator for wholesale loans is the
internal risk rating assigned to each loan. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further
information on these risk ratings.

Internal risk rating is the primary credit quality indicator for retained wholesale loans. The following tables
provide information on internal risk rating and gross charge-offs.

(a) At June 30, 2025 and 2024, in addition to the allowance for credit losses in the table above, the Firm also had
an allowance for credit losses of $ 288million and $ 278million, respectively, associated with certain accounts
receivable in CIB.
(b) Includes collateral-dependent loans, including those for which foreclosure is deemed probable, and nonaccrual
risk-rated loans.
(c) The allowance for lending-related commitments is reported in accounts payable and other liabilities on the
Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) At June 30, 2025 and 2024, lending-related commitments excluded $ 20.7billion and $ 19.8billion, respectively,
for the consumer, excluding credit card portfolio segment; $ 1.0trillion and $ 964.7billion, respectively, for the
credit card portfolio segment; and $ 24.2billion and $ 32.6billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio
segment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.
                                                        158                                                        
Discussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2025 was $ 28.3billion,
reflecting a net addition of $ 1.4billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to the allowance for credit
losses included: • $ 1.0billion in wholesale , predominantly driven by changes in credit quality of client-specific
exposures, the impact of new lending-related commitments, as well as the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-
average macroeconomic outlook, and • $ 444million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting
loan growth and the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. As of December 31,
2024, the Firm's qualitative adjustments and its weighted-average macroeconomic outlook included additional weight
placed on the adverse scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and
macroeconomic environment. In the first quarter of 2025, the Firm further increased the weight placed on the
adverse scenarios, and in the second quarter, the Firm partially reduced the increase in weight implemented in the
first quarter. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally
developed macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the
central case assumptions provided in the following table, resulting in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate
peaking at 5.9% in the second quarter of 2026, and • a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.0% lower than
the central case at the end of the fourth quarter of 2026.
The following table presents the Firm’s central case
assumptions for the periods presented:

Significant Firm-sponsored VIEs Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the
Firm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase
Issuance Trust. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized)
originated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB
and CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm
may act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.
                                                        160                                                        
The following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label
securitization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are
consolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or
subordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or
guarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is
servicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value
of these interests. Refer to page 166 of this Note for information on the securitization-related loan delinquencies
and liquidation losses.

Multi-seller conduits In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase makes markets in and invests in commercial
paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 2.2billion and $ 2.9billion of the
commercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
respectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs
and capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to
credit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued
by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and
credit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered
multi-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller
conduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 11.4billion and $ 10.3billion at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,
respectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to
extend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal
bond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their
municipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer
TOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB
transactions.

(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.
(b) Primarily includes consumer loans in CIB.
(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.
(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of
those entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and
exclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.
(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the
Consolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial
interests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorganChase. Included in beneficial interests
in VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.5billion at both June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.
(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
VIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These
include, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement
agent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual
credit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the
underlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,
the Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated
balance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party
transaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are
limited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other
projects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing
member and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does
not consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and
earns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. At June 30, 2025 and
December 31, 2024, the maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $
35.0billion and $ 35.2billion, of which $ 14.5billion and $ 15.0billion was unfunded, respectively. The Firm
assesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts
                                                        163                                                        
of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more
information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm elected the proportional amortization method
for certain tax-oriented investments on a program-by-program basis. The proportional amortization method requires
the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits
received with the resulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated
tax credits and other tax benefits. Investments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, including that
substantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. In addition, under this
method deferred taxes are generally not recorded as the investment is now amortized in proportion to the income tax
credits and other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity contributions that are unconditional and legally
binding or conditional and probable of occurring are recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding increase in
the carrying value of the investment. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when
significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a change in
the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. During the period, there were no significant modifications or
events that resulted in a change in the nature of an eligible investment or a change in the Firm's relationship
with the underlying project.
The following table provides information on tax-
oriented investments for which the Firm elected to
apply the proportional amortization method.

Customer municipal bond vehicles (TOB trusts) The Firm
may provide various services to customer TOB trusts,
including remarketing agent, liquidity or tender
option provider. In certain customer TOB transactions,
the Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a
reimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In
those transactions, upon the termination of the
vehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party
Residual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not
have any intent to protect Residual holders from
potential losses on any of the underlying municipal
bonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB
trusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make
decisions that significantly impact the economic
performance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s
maximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer
TOB trusts at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was
$ 6.8billion and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair
value of assets held by such VIEs at June 30, 2025 and
December 31, 2024 was $ 9.1billion and $ 8.1billion,
respectively.

Loans and excess MSRs sold to U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and loans in securitization transactions
pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines In addition to the amounts reported in the securitization activity tables above,
the Firm, in the normal course of business, sells originated and purchased mortgage loans and certain originated
excess MSRs on a nonrecourse basis, predominantly to U.S. GSEs. These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for
the purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement
of the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these
loans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the
securitization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of
loan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the
purchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and
securitization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale
of certain excess MSRs.
The following table summarizes the activities related
to loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in
securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae
guidelines.

Options to repurchase delinquent loans In addition to the Firm’s obligation to repurchase certain loans due to
material breaches of representations and warranties as discussed in Note 22, the Firm also has the option to
repurchase delinquent loans that it services for Ginnie Mae loan pools, as well as for other U.S. government
agencies under certain arrangements. The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan
pools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable
requirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes
exercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding
liability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.
The following table presents loans the Firm
repurchased or had an option to repurchase, real
estate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed
residential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s
Consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2025 and

government agencies.

Loan delinquencies and liquidation losses
The table below includes information about components of and delinquencies related to nonconsolidated securitized
financial assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label securitization entities, in which the Firm has continuing
involvement as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. For loans sold or securitized where servicing is the Firm’s
only form of continuing involvement, the Firm generally experiences a loss only if the Firm was required to
repurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with
its loan sale or servicing contracts.

Note 14 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and
other intangible assets

Refer to Note 15 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion of goodwill, mortgage servicing
rights, and other intangible assets and the related
accounting policies. Goodwill Goodwill is recorded
upon completion of a business combination as the
difference between the purchase price and the fair
value of the net assets acquired, and can be adjusted
up to one year from the acquisition date as additional
information pertaining to facts and circumstances that
existed as of the acquisition date is obtained about
the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed.
The following table presents goodwill attributed to
the reportable business segments and Corporate.

Goodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or
more often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be
an impairment. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital
requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes
or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting
units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period
related to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of June 30, 2025, the Firm reviewed current economic
conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business
performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2025 or
December 31, 2024, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2025 or
2024.

Mortgage servicing rights

MSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The
fair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service
the loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the
MSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or
recognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the
valuation of MSRs.

(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result
of loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.
(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.
(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),
which will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the
trust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because
reimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors. In addition, the Firm
maintains the right to stop payment to investors if the collateral is insufficient to cover the advance. However,
certain of these servicer advances may not be recoverable if they were not made in accordance with applicable rules
and agreements.
(e) Includes excess MSRs transferred to agency-sponsored trusts in exchange for stripped mortgage-backed securities
(“SMBS”). In each transaction, a portion of the SMBS was acquired by third parties at the transaction date; the
Firm acquired the remaining balance of those SMBS as trading securities.

(a) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,
and the difference between actual and expected prepayments.
(b) Represents the aggregate impact of changes in model inputs and assumptions such as projected cash flows (e.g.,
cost to service), discount rates and changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market
interest rates (e.g., changes in prepayments due to changes in home prices).
Changes in fair value based on variations in assumptions generally cannot be easily extrapolated, because the
relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value are often highly interrelated and may not
be linear. In the following table, the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value
is calculated without changing any other assumption. In reality, changes in one factor may result in changes in
another, which would either magnify or counteract the impact of the initial change.
The table below outlines the key economic assumptions
used to determine the fair value of the Firm’s MSRs at
June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, and outlines the
sensitivities of those fair values to immediate
adverse changes in those assumptions, as defined
below.

Other intangible assets The Firm’s finite-lived and indefinite-lived other intangible assets are initially recorded
at their fair value primarily upon completion of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets, including
core deposit intangibles, customer relationship intangibles, and certain other intangible assets, are amortized
over their useful lives, estimated based on the expected future economic benefits. The Firm’s intangible assets
with indefinite lives, such as asset management contracts, are not subject to amortization and are assessed
periodically for impairment. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the net carrying values of other intangible
assets consisted of finite-lived intangible assets of $ 1.5billion and $ 1.7billion, respectively, as well as
indefinite-lived intangible assets, which are not subject to amortization, of $ 1.2billion at both periods.

restrictions are imposed by various regulatory
authorities based on the particular activities of the
Firm’s subsidiaries.

The Firm is also subject to rules and regulations
established by U.S. and non-U.S. regulators. As part
of its compliance with the respective regulatory
requirements, the Firm’s broker-dealer activities are
subject to certain restrictions on cash and other
assets.
The following table presents the components of the
Firm’s restricted cash:

Refer to Note 27 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
a detailed discussion on regulatory capital. The
Federal Reserve establishes capital requirements,
including well-capitalized standards, for the Firm as
a consolidated financial holding company. The OCC
establishes similar minimum capital requirements and
standards for the Firm’s principal IDI subsidiary,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Under the risk-based capital
and leverage-based guidelines of the Federal Reserve,
JPMorgan Chase & Co. is required to maintain minimum
ratios for CET1 capital, Tier 1 capital, Total
capital, Tier 1 leverage and the SLR. Failure to meet
these minimum requirements could cause the Federal
Reserve to take action. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is
also subject to these capital requirements established
by its primary regulators.
The following table presents the risk-based regulatory
capital ratio requirements and well-capitalized ratios

CECL Regulatory Capital Transition Beginning January
1, 2022, the $ 2.9billion CECL capital benefit,
provided by the Federal Reserve in response to the
COVID-19 pandemic, was phased out at 25% per year over
a three-year period and fully phased out as of January
1, 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the Firm's CET1
capital reflected the remaining benefit of $
720million associated with the CECL capital transition
provisions. Similarly, as of January 1, 2025, the Firm
has phased out the other CECL capital transition
provisions which impacted Tier 2 capital, adjusted
average assets, total leverage exposure and RWA, as
applicable. Refer to Note 27 of JPMorganChase’s 2024
Form 10-K for further information on CECL capital
transition provisions.

financial instruments, guarantees, and other

commitments

JPMorganChase provides lending-related financial instruments (e.g., commitments and guarantees) to address the
financing needs of its customers and clients. The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the
maximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be
required to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to
perform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been
refinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total
contractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit
exposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of
lending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected
credit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on
lending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for
credit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying
values of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30,
2025 and December 31, 2024. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business
banking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not
experienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at
the same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to the extent
otherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the
borrower or significant decrease in the value of underlying property.

(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.

(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CIB.

(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.

(d) As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling
$ 155million and $ 85million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $ 9.5billion at both
periods for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; $ 699million and $ 556million, respectively,
for other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of
risk participations.

(e) As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending
indemnification agreements was $ 388.5billion and $ 328.7billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral
primarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies.

(f) As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under
the sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain
clearing houses.

(g) As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, primarily includes unfunded commitments to purchase secondary market
loans, other equity investment commitments, and unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity
investments.

(h) For lending-related products, the carrying value includes the allowance for lending-related commitments and the
guarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value
option was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.

(i) For lending-related commitments, the carrying value also includes fees and any purchase discounts or premiums
that are deferred and recognized in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.
Deferred amounts for revolving commitments and commitments not expected to fund, are amortized to lending- and
deposit-related fees on a straight line basis over the commitment period. For all other commitments the deferred
amounts remain deferred until the commitment funds or is sold.

Other unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of
commitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper
facilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well
as committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose
facilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.
Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees
are conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a
third party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition
financings, trade financings and similar transactions.
The following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other
financial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.

Loan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and
securitization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet
certain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan
purchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase
demands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its
litigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
additional information regarding litigation.

Merchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment
networks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the
Firm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,
retains a contingent liability for disputed processed
credit and debit card transactions that result in a
charge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved
in the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the
cardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount
to the cardholder and will charge back the transaction
to the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the
amount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss
for the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder.
The Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future
settlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or
obtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm
recognizes a valuation allowance that covers the
payment or performance risk related to charge-backs.
Sponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a
sponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term
resale and repurchase agreements through the
Government Securities Division of the Fixed Income
Clearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients
that become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.
The Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and
full payment and performance of its sponsored member
clients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s
rules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these
guarantees by obtaining a security interest in the
cash or high-quality securities collateral that the
clients place with the clearing house; therefore, the
Firm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s
maximum possible exposure, without taking into
consideration the associated collateral, is included
in the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and
commitments line on page 180. Refer to Note 11 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional
information on credit risk mitigation practices on
resale agreements and the types of collateral pledged
under repurchase agreements. Guarantees of
subsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain
long-term debt and structured notes of its
subsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial
Company LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance
subsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully
and unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company
and no other subsidiary of the Parent Company
guarantees these securities. These guarantees, which
rank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and
unsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the
table on page 180 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional
information.

Note 23 – Pledged assets and collateral

Refer to Note 29 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for
a discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and
collateral.

Pledged assets

The Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to
maintain potential borrowing capacity at discount
windows with Federal Reserve banks, various other
central banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm
pledges assets for other purposes, including to
collateralize repurchase and other securities
financing agreements, to cover short sales and to
collateralize derivative contracts and deposits.
Certain of these pledged assets may be sold or
repledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and
are parenthetically identified on the Consolidated
balance sheets as assets pledged.
The following table presents the carrying value of the
Firm’s pledged assets.

Collateral

The Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that
it is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or
otherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained
under resale and other securities financing
agreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-
investment customer receivables and derivative
contracts. Collateral is generally used under
repurchase and other securities financing agreements,
to cover short sales and to collateralize derivative
contracts and deposits.

Contingencies

As of June 30, 2025, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous
evolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations,
regulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions
involving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations
and regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and
self-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or
investigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of
claims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection
claims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of
reasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to
approximately $ 1.1billion at June 30, 2025. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based
upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of
reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be
made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves
significant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that
many are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the
Firm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of
the proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the
uncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions
concerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties
or regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular
proceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the
likelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably
possible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are
descriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a
defendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian
state-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse)
SA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB
and paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company
between 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the
validity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by
1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a
new claim in the future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals court is scheduled to
hear both appeals in November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In
addition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan
(Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions
arising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons
for the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement
Directorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010
and 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase entities into residential housing projects
developed by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential
units. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million,
and the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making
preliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore
funds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering
provisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the
inquiry.
                                                        183                                                        
Foreign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government
authorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those
activities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal
antitrust law. The Department of Labor ("DOL") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates
to continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining
FX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before
the South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related individual and
putative class actions filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia
remain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a
request for class certification on an opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this decision to the U.K. Supreme
Court. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to
court approval. In Australia, the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action. The
settlement is subject to Court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed
a series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set
the price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In
September 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively
contributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for
the Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the
settlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action
seeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class
certification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval
of a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their
respective network rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are
considering next steps. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed
individual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other
banks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who
opted out representing over 80% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. A
number of these actions are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and
that court has scheduled a trial of the claims brought by several merchants to begin in April 2026. LIBOR and Other
Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from various governmental
agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London
Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank
Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm
and other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the
European General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-
impose a fine in an identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of
Justice of the European Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in
various individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions
related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and
interest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm has obtained dismissal of certain
actions and resolved certain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has moved for summary judgment. In
addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm
and other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the
market for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by the
United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in December 2024. In June 2025, the United States Supreme
Court denied these plaintiffs’ petition for certiorari. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions.
Russian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking
of certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are
within the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened
                                                        184                                                        
litigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, and is contractually excused from paying as
a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed against other financial
institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual agreements concerning forum selection and
did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. Russian courts have entered judgment
against the Firm in a number of claims, including one for $ 439million, and a judgment has been executed against
assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the total amount of available
assets that the Firm holds in Russia. Russian courts have nevertheless allowed plaintiffs to withhold dividends due
to the Firm’s clients for the purpose of satisfying judgments, which the Firm is opposing as unlawful. The Firm
continues to appeal the Russian courts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian
courts have also ordered interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank
accounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a
determination of certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the
Russian courts and related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties’ contractual forum
selections. If further claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders
and to seek the proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and certain client
assets could also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. Shareholder
Litigation . A shareholder derivative action purporting to act on behalf of the Firm is pending in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of
its current and former officers relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals
and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC
and SEC in September 2020. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. * * * In addition to the various legal
proceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved
in a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims
asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously.
Additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves
for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP
for contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability
has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal
proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or
downward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal
expense was $ 118million and $ 317million for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. There is
no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the
inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very
large or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of
parties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual
outcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines,
penalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, based upon its current knowledge and
after consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking
into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other
legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated
financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings,
there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it
has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome
of a particular matter may be material to JPMorganChase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on,
among other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorganChase’s income for that
period.

  Note 25 – Business segments & Corporate                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
The Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are threereportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking,
Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. The
business segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and
they reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose
members act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a managed
basis. Refer to JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP
Financial Measures on page 67 for a definition of managed basis and Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s
business segments. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the reportable business
segments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting
process that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm
periodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and
therefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital
required for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are
utilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business
segments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and
customers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally
recognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or
businesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.
Funds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income
and expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to
Treasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics
of assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in
the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of
net interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect
to consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest
income that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income. As a result of lower
average interest rates in the current year, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for
liabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is
transferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and
CIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the
transferred risk in its results. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is
referred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are
reassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Note 32 of
JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.

Segment & Corporate results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the
three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis
starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for
the Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that
receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable
investments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the
Firm’s managed basis.

To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of JPMorgan
Chase & Co.:
                                                                                                                   
  Results of Review of Interim Financial Statements                                                                
                                                                                                                   
We have reviewed the accompanying consolidated balance
sheet of JPMorgan Chase & Co. and its subsidiaries
(the “Firm”) as of June 30, 2025, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income and changes in stockholders’ equity for the
three-month and six-month periods ended June 30, 2025
and 2024, and the consolidated statements of cash
flows for the six-month periods ended June 30, 2025
and 2024, including the related notes (collectively
referred to as the “interim financial statements”).
Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any material
modifications that should be made to the accompanying
interim financial statements for them to be in
conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America.

We have previously audited, in accordance with the
standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheet
of the Firm as of December 31, 2024, and the related
consolidated statements of income, comprehensive
income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows
for the year then ended (not presented herein), and in
our report dated February 14, 2025, we expressed an
unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial
statements. In our opinion, the information set forth
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet
information as of December 31, 2024, is fairly stated,
in all material respects, in relation to the
consolidated balance sheet from which it has been
derived.
                                                                                                                   
  Basis for Review Results                                                                                         
                                                                                                                   
These interim financial statements are the
responsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a
public accounting firm registered with the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)
(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with
respect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.
federal securities laws and the applicable rules and
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance
with the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim
financial information consists principally of applying
analytical procedures and making inquiries of persons
responsible for financial and accounting matters. It
is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the
objective of which is the expression of an opinion
regarding the financial statements taken as a whole.
Accordingly, we do not express such an opinion.

Credit derivatives: Financial instruments whose value
is derived from the credit risk associated with the
debt of a third-party issuer (the reference entity)
which allow one party (the protection purchaser) to
transfer that risk to another party (the protection
seller). Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the
reference entity, which may include, among other
events, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its
obligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of
the reference entity, neither party has recourse to
the reference entity. The protection purchaser has
recourse to the protection seller for the difference
between the face value of the CDS contract and the
fair value at the time of settling the credit
derivative contract. The determination as to whether a
credit event has occurred is generally made by the
relevant International Swaps and Derivatives
Association (“ISDA”) Determinations Committee.

Embedded derivatives: Implicit or explicit terms or
features of a financial instrument that affect some or
all of the cash flows or the value of the instrument
in a manner similar to a derivative. An instrument
containing such terms or features is referred to as a
“hybrid.” The component of the hybrid that is the non-
derivative instrument is referred to as the “host.”
For example, callable debt is a hybrid instrument that
contains a plain vanilla debt instrument (i.e., the
host) and an embedded option that allows the issuer to
redeem the debt issue at a specified date for a
specified amount (i.e., the embedded derivative).
However, a floating rate instrument is not a hybrid
composed of a fixed-rate instrument and an interest
rate swap.

LTV: “Loan-to-value ratio”: For residential real
estate loans, the relationship, expressed as a
percentage, between the principal amount of a loan and
the

appraised value of the collateral (i.e., residential
real estate) securing the loan.

Origination date LTV ratio: The LTV ratio at the
origination date of the loan. Origination date LTV
ratios are calculated based on the actual appraised
values of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the
origination date.

Current estimated LTV ratio: An estimate of the LTV as
of a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios
are calculated using estimated collateral values
derived from a nationally recognized home price index
measured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”)
level. These MSA-level home price indices consist of
actual data to the extent available and forecasted
data where actual data is not available. As a result,
the estimated collateral values used to calculate
these ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-
level collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV
ratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore
be viewed as estimates.

Combined LTV ratio: The LTV ratio considering all
available lien positions, as well as unused lines,
related to the property. Combined LTV ratios are used
for junior lien home equity products.

Currencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income
Financing and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income
Markets.

Managed basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide
financial results that includes reclassifications to

segment level, because it believes this provides
information to enable investors to understand the
underlying operational performance and trends of the
particular business segment and facilitates a
comparison of the business segment with the
performance of competitors.

Markets: Consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and
Equity Markets businesses.

Master netting agreement: A single agreement with a
counterparty that permits multiple transactions
governed by that agreement to be terminated or
accelerated and settled through a single payment in a

Mortgage product types:

Alt-A

Alt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality
than subprime loans but have characteristics that
would disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime
loan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or
more of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)
a high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner
occupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio
above normal limits. A substantial proportion of the
Firm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not
provide complete documentation of his or her assets or
the amount or source of his or her income.

Option ARMs

The option ARM real estate loan product is an
adjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the
borrower with the option each month to make a fully
amortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The
minimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the
interest rate charged during the introductory period.
This introductory rate is usually significantly below
the fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is
calculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the
introductory period ends, the contractual interest
rate charged on the loan increases to the fully
indexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements
in the index. The minimum payment is typically
insufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior
month, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added
to the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans
are subject to payment recast, which converts the loan
to a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting
specified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.

Prime

Prime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good
credit records who meet specific underwriting
requirements, including prescriptive requirements
related to income and overall debt levels. New prime
mortgage borrowers provide full documentation and
generally have reliable payment histories.

Subprime

Subprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were
offered to certain customers with one or more high
risk characteristics, including but not limited to:
(i) unreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high
LTV ratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid
mortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income
ratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other
than the

borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a history of
delinquencies or late payments on the loan.

MREL: Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible
liabilities

MSR: Mortgage servicing rights

NA: Data is not applicable or available for the period
presented.

Net Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.

Net charge-off/(recovery) rate: Represents net charge-
offs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average
retained loans for the reporting period.

Net interchange income includes the following
components:

• Interchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit
card issuers on sales transactions.

• Rewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points
earned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards
programs generally tied to sales transactions.

• Partner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card
partners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards
earned by cardholders on credit card transactions.

Net yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate
for interest-earning assets less the average rate paid
for all sources of funds.

NFA: National Futures Association

NM: Not meaningful

Nonaccrual loans: Loans for which interest income is
not recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than
credit card loans and certain consumer loans insured
by U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual
status when full payment of principal and interest is
not expected, regardless of delinquency status, or
when principal and interest has been in default for a
period of 90 days or more unless the loan is both
well-secured and in the process of collection.
Collateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on
nonaccrual status.

Nonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include
nonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and
certain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,
predominantly real estate owned and other commercial
and personal property.

NSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio

OCC: Office of the Comptroller of the Currency

OTC: “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative
contracts that are negotiated, executed and settled
bilaterally between two derivative counterparties,
where one or both counterparties is a derivatives
dealer.

OTC cleared: “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”:
Derivative contracts that are negotiated and executed
bilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central
clearing house, such that each derivative counterparty
is only exposed to the default of that clearing house.

Overhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of
total net revenue.

Parent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.

Participating securities: Represents unvested share-
based compensation awards containing nonforfeitable
rights to dividends or dividend equivalents
(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the
earnings per share calculation using the two-class
method. JPMorganChase grants restricted stock and RSUs
to certain employees under its share-based
compensation programs, which entitle the recipients to
receive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting
period on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to
holders of common stock. These unvested awards meet
the definition of participating securities. Under the
two-class method, all earnings (distributed and
undistributed) are allocated to each class of common
stock and participating securities, based on their
respective rights to receive dividends.

PCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent
acquired financial assets that as of the date of
acquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant
deterioration in credit quality since origination, as
determined by the Firm.

Pillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum
capital requirements, defines eligible capital
instruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.

Pillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three
“Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market
discipline through disclosure requirements which allow
market participants to assess the risk and capital
profiles of banks.

PRA: Prudential Regulation Authority

Preferred stock dividends: Reflects dividends declared
and deemed dividends upon redemption of preferred
stock

Pre-provision profit/(loss): Represents total net
revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes
that this financial measure is useful in assessing the
ability of a lending institution to generate income in
excess of its provision for credit losses.

Principal transactions revenue: Principal transactions
revenue is driven by many factors, including the bid-

offer spread, which is the difference between the
price at which the Firm is willing to buy a financial
or other instrument and the price at which the Firm is
willing to sell that instrument. It also consists of
realized (as a result of closing out or termination of
transactions, or interim cash payments) and unrealized
(as a result of changes in valuation) gains and losses
on financial and other instruments (including those
accounted for under the fair value option) primarily
used in client-driven market-making activities and on
private equity investments. In connection with its
client-driven market-making activities, the Firm
transacts in debt and equity instruments, derivatives
and commodities (including physical commodities
inventories and financial instruments that reference
commodities). Principal transactions revenue also
includes certain realized and unrealized gains and
losses related to hedge accounting and specified risk-
management activities, including: (a) certain
derivatives designated in qualifying hedge accounting
relationships (primarily fair value hedges of
commodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain
derivatives used for specific risk management
purposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and
foreign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.

RWA: “Risk-weighted assets”: Basel III establishes two
comprehensive approaches for calculating RWA (a
Standardized approach and an Advanced approach) which
include capital requirements for credit risk, market
risk, and in the case of Basel III Advanced, also
                                                        196                                                        
operational risk. Key differences in the calculation
of credit risk RWA between the Standardized and
Advanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,
credit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches
which largely rely on the use of internal credit
models and parameters, whereas for Basel III
Standardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on
supervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by
counterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is
calculated on a generally consistent basis between
Basel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.

Asset Management has two high-level measures of its
overall fund performance:

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds rated 4- or 5-star : Mutual
fund rating services rank funds based on their risk-
adjusted performance over various periods. A 5-star
rating is the best rating and represents the top 10%
of industry-wide ranked funds. A 4-star rating
represents the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked
funds. A 3-star rating represents the next 35% of
industry-wide ranked funds. A 2-star rating represents
the next 22.5% of industry-wide ranked funds. A 1-star
rating is the worst rating and represents the bottom
10% of industry-wide ranked funds. An overall
Morningstar rating is derived from a weighted average
of the performance associated with a fund’s three-,
five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating
metrics. For U.S.-domiciled funds, separate star
ratings are provided at the individual share class
level.

The Nomura “star rating” is based on three-year risk-
adjusted performance only. Funds with fewer than three
years of history are not rated and hence excluded from
these rankings. All ratings, the assigned peer
categories and the asset values used to derive these
rankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating
provider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers
redenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The
percentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the
share class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a
“primary share class” level to represent the star
rating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which
Nomura provides ratings at the fund level. The
performance data may have been different if all share
classes had been included. Past performance is not
indicative of future results.

Percentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets
under management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd
quartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile
rankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset
values used to derive these rankings are sourced from
the fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based
on the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where
applicable, the fund rating providers redenominate
asset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM
is based on fund performance and associated peer
rankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled
funds, at a “primary share class” level to represent
the quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong
Kong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.
The performance data may have been different if all
share classes had been included. Past performance is
not indicative of future results.

“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for
European funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and
Taiwan funds. If these share classes are not
available, the oldest share class is used as the
primary share class.

Embassy in London, U.K. was the beneficiary. The Firm
did not charge a fee for these transactions.

The payments were for the renewal of travel
documentation for the client’s three minor children
and were therefore exempt transactions pursuant to 31
C.F.R. 560.219(d).

The Firm does not intend to engage in such
transactions in the future.
