Refer to Capital Risk\nManagement on pages 43-49 for additional information.\n(c) NII and NIR refer to net interest income and\nnoninterest revenue, respectively.\n(d) Markets consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and\nEquity Markets businesses. The Firm assesses the\nperformance of its Markets business on a total net\nrevenue basis, as revenues in NII generally have\noffsets across other revenue lines, primarily\nPrincipal transactions revenue.\nComparisons noted in the sections below are for the\nsecond quarter of 2025 versus the second quarter of\n2024, unless otherwise specified.\nFirmwide overview\nFor the second quarter of 2025, JPMorganChase reported\nnet income of $15.0 billion, down 17%, with earnings\nper share of $5.24, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 21%. The\nFirm's results included a $774 million income tax\nbenefit in Corporate.\nTotal net revenue was $44.9 billion, down 11%,\nreflecting:\n– Net interest income (\"NII\") was $23.2 billion, up\n2%, driven by higher Markets net interest income,\nhigher wholesale deposit balances, higher revolving\nbalances in Card Services, and the\nimpact of investment securities activity including\nfrom prior quarters. These factors were predominantly\noffset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin\ncompression. NII excluding Markets was $22.8 billion,\ndown 1%.\n– Noninterest revenue (\"NIR\") was $21.7 billion, down\n21%, primarily reflecting the absence of the $7.9\nbillion net gain related to Visa shares recorded in\nthe prior year. Excluding this net gain, NIR would\nhave been up 11% driven by higher Markets noninterest\nrevenue, lower net investment securities losses in\nTreasury and CIO, and increases in asset management\nfees in AWM and CCB, auto operating lease income,\ninvestment banking fees, and Payments fees.\n5\nNoninterest expense was $23.8 billion, flat when\ncompared with the prior year, driven by higher\ncompensation expense, including higher revenue-related\ncompensation and growth in the number of employees, as\nwell as higher brokerage expense and distribution\nfees, higher auto lease depreciation, and continued\ninvestments in technology. These factors were offset\nby the absence of the $1.0 billion contribution of\nVisa shares to the JPMorgan Chase Foundation recorded\nin the prior year, as well as lower legal expense.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.8 billion.\nNet charge-offs of $2.4 billion, predominantly in Card\nServices, were up $179 million. The net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses of $439 million,\nprimarily in wholesale, was driven by the impact of\nnet lending activity, largely offset by the impact of\nchanges in the Firm’s weighted-average macroeconomic\noutlook, including a decrease in the weight placed on\nthe adverse scenarios.\nIn the prior year, the provision was $3.1 billion, net\ncharge-offs were $2.2 billion and the net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses was $821 million.\nThe total allowance for credit losses was $28.3\nbillion at June 30, 2025 . The Firm had an allowance\nfor loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of\n1.85%, compared with 1.81% in the prior year.\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations and\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 9-13 and\npages 14-15, respectively, for a further discussion of\nthe Firm's results, including the provision for credit\nlosses.\nPre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR\nexcluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed\nbasis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 17-18 for a\nfurther discussion of each of these measures.\nThe Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $10.5\nbillion at June 30, 2025 , up 24%, driven by:\n– higher wholesale nonaccrual loans, largely related\nto certain exposures in Technology, Media &\nTelecommunications, Utilities, and Real Estate,\nreflecting downgrades, and\n– higher consumer nonaccrual loans, predominantly due\nto the impact of the wildfires in California in\nJanuary 2025, as well as higher loans at fair value in\nCIB.\nRefer to Wholesale Credit Portfolio and Consumer\nCredit Portfolio on pages 64-72 and pages 60-63,\nrespectively, for additional information.\nFirmwide average loans of $1.4 trillion were up 5%,\npredominantly driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM.\nFirmwide average deposits of $2.5 trillion were up\n6%, reflecting:\n– net inflows related to client-driven activities in\nPayments and Securities Services, and\n– growth in balances in new and existing client\naccounts in AWM,\npartially offset by\n– a decrease in CCB in existing account balances\nprimarily driven by increased customer spending and\nmigration into higher-yielding investments.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 for\nadditional information.\nSelected capital and other metrics\nCET1 capital was $284 billion, and the Standardized\nand Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.1% and 15.2%,\nrespectively.\nSLR was 5.9%.\nTBVPS grew 11%, ending the second quarter of 2025 at\n$103.40.\nAs of June 30, 2025 , the Firm had eligible end-of-\nperiod High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of\napproximately $970 billion and unencumbered marketable\nsecurities with a fair value of approximately $573\nbillion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of\nliquidity sources.

There is no\nassurance that actual results in 2025 will be in line\nwith the outlook information set forth below, and the\nFirm does not undertake to update any forward-looking\nstatements.\nJPMorganChase’s current outlook for full-year 2025\nshould be viewed against the backdrop of the global\nand U.S. economies, financial markets activity, the\ngeopolitical environment, the competitive environment,\nclient and customer activity levels, and regulatory\nand legislative developments in the U.S. and other\ncountries where the Firm does business. Each of these\nfactors will affect the performance of the Firm. The\nFirm will continue to make appropriate adjustments to\nits businesses and operations in response to ongoing\ndevelopments in the business, economic, regulatory and\nlegal environments in which it operates.\nFull-year 2025\nManagement expects net interest income to be\napproximately $95.5 billion and net interest income\nexcluding Markets to be approximately $92.0 billion,\nmarket dependent.\nManagement expects adjusted expense to be\napproximately $95.5 billion, market dependent.\nManagement expects the net charge-off rate in Card\nServices to be approximately 3.60%.\nNet interest income excluding Markets and adjusted\nexpense are non-GAAP financial measures.

These non-GAAP measures include:\nFirmwide “managed” basis results, including the\noverhead ratio, which include certain\nreclassifications to present total net revenue from\ninvestments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt\nsecurities on a basis comparable to taxable\ninvestments and securities (“FTE” basis). The\ncorresponding income tax impact related to tax-exempt\nitems is recorded within income tax\nexpense. These adjustments have no impact on net\nincome as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the\nLOBs;\nPre-provision profit, which represents total net\nrevenue less total noninterest expense;\nNet interest income, net yield, and noninterest\nrevenue excluding Markets;\nTCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS; and\nAdjusted expense, which represents noninterest\nexpense excluding Firmwide legal expense.\nRefer to Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 67–69 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further\ndiscussion of management’s use of non-GAAP

There are three\nreportable business segments – Consumer & Community\nBanking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset &\nWealth Management – with the remaining activities in\nCorporate.\nThe business segments are determined based on the\nproducts and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in which\nfinancial information is evaluated by the Firm’s\nOperating Committee, whose members act collectively as\nthe Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 17-18 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\nResults of the reportable business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were a\nstand-alone business. The management reporting process\nthat derives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for\nsegment reporting, and therefore further refinements\nmay be implemented in future periods. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on\nat least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide\nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the\nFirm and its investors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments or businesses within each\nsegment join efforts to sell products and services to\nthe Firm’s clients and customers, the participating\nbusinesses may agree to share revenue from those\ntransactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related product or\nservice, with allocations to the other segments or\nbusinesses involved in the transaction. The segment\nand business results reflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which\nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the\nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and\nCIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized\nin the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic\nconditions and other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the segments.\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm\nupdated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits,\nwhich resulted in an increase in the funding benefit\nreflected within CCB’s net interest income that is\nfully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the\nFirm’s net interest income.\nAs a result of lower average interest rates in the\ncurrent year, the cost of funding for assets and the\nfunding benefit earned for liabilities generally\ndecreased compared with the prior year.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and\nOther Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these\nrisks centrally and reports the impact of foreign\nexchange rate movements related to the transferred\nrisk in its results.

Net\ninterchange was relatively flat as the impact of\nincreased debit and credit card sales volume was\noffset by higher rewards costs and partner payments.\nRefer to Note 5 for additional information on card\nincome and asset management fees; and Critical\nAccounting Estimates on pages 85-88 for additional\ninformation on the credit card rewards liability.\nNoninterest expense was $9.9 billion, up 5%,\nreflecting:\nhigher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven\nby higher auto lease depreciation on higher auto\noperating lease assets, and continued investments in\ntechnology and marketing, as well as\nhigher compensation expense, primarily for bankers\nand employees in technology.\nThe provision for credit losses was $2.1 billion. Net\ncharge-offs were $2.1 billion, up $22 million,\nprimarily driven by Card Services, reflecting loan\ngrowth. The allowance for credit losses was relatively\nflat, as the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-\naverage macroeconomic outlook, including a decrease in\nthe weight placed on the adverse scenarios, was offset\nby loan growth in Card Services.\nIn the prior year, the provision was $2.6 billion, net\ncharge-offs were $2.1 billion and the net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses was $579 million.\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 58-76 and Allowance for Credit Losses on pages\n73-75 for a further discussion of the credit\nportfolios and the allowance for credit losses.\nYear-to-date results\nNet income was $9.6 billion, up 6%.\nNet revenue was $37.2 billion, up 5%.\nNet interest income was $28.5 billion, up 4%, driven\nby:\nhigher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by\nhigher revolving balances,\npartially offset by\nlower NII in BWM, reflecting lower average deposit\nbalances.\nNoninterest revenue was $8.6 billion, up 9%,\npredominantly driven by:\nhigher auto operating lease income as a result of an\nincrease in volume, and\nhigher asset management fees in BWM, reflecting\nhigher average market levels and to a lesser extent,\nnet inflows,\npartially offset by\nlower card income, reflecting an increase in\namortization related to new account origination costs\nand lower net interchange, largely offset by higher\nannual fees. Net interchange decreased as the impact\nof increased debit and credit card sales volume was\nmore than offset by higher rewards costs and partner\npayments.\nNoninterest expense was $19.7 billion, up 5%,\nreflecting:\nhigher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven\nby continued investments in technology and marketing,\nhigher auto lease depreciation on higher auto\noperating lease assets, and higher operating losses,\nas well as\nhigher compensation expense, predominantly for\nbankers and advisors, and employees in technology.\nThe provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion. Net\ncharge-offs were $4.2 billion, up $297 million,\nprimarily driven by Card Services, reflecting loan\ngrowth. The net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses was $471 million, predominantly driven by Card\nServices, reflecting loan growth and the impact of\nchanges in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic\noutlook.\nIn the prior year, the provision was $4.6 billion, net\ncharge-offs were $3.9 billion and the net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses was $613

When the Firm extends a consumer or\nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their\ninvestment decisions, makes markets in securities, or\noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is\nto manage its business, and the associated risks, in a\nmanner that balances serving the interests of its\nclients, customers and investors, and protecting the\nsafety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes\nthat effective risk management requires, among other\nthings: • Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and management within\neach of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk\ngovernance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a\ndisciplined and balanced compensation framework with\nstrong internal governance and independent oversight\nby the Board of Directors (the “Board”).

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks\nis determined by calculating risk-weighted assets\n(\"RWA\"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-\nbalance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk.\nUnder the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and\nan advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”).\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the\nlower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements.\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Firm’s Basel III Standardized\nrisk-based ratios continue to be more binding than the\nBasel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\nAdditionally, Basel III requires that Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm,\ncalculate their SLRs.\nRefer to page 46 of this Form 10-Q and page 104 of\nJPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on SLR.\nKey Regulatory Developments\nEnhanced SLR Proposal\nIn June 2025, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the\nComptroller of the Currency (\"OCC\"), and the FDIC\nreleased a proposal to amend the enhanced\nSupplementary Leverage Ratio (“eSLR”) requirements for\nGlobal Systemically Important Banks (“GSIB”) BHCs and\ntheir insured depository institution (“IDI”)\nsubsidiaries by revising the current static leverage\nbuffers at the BHC and IDI levels to 50 percent of the\nparent GSIB’s U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge, which is\nreferred to as the “eSLR buffer.” In addition, the\nproposal would make corresponding adjustments to the\nleverage-based total loss-absorbing capacity (“TLAC”)\nand eligible long-term debt (“eligible LTD”)\nrequirements by replacing the current TLAC leverage\nbuffer with the eSLR buffer and replacing the current\nstatic leverage-based eligible LTD requirement with a\nrequirement of 2.5% plus the eSLR buffer. Further, the\nproposal would remove the eSLR threshold for an IDI\nsubsidiary of a U.S. GSIB to be considered “well\ncapitalized” under the prompt corrective action\nframework and instead apply the eSLR as a capital\nbuffer requirement.\nRefer to page 100 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K\nfor information on the U.S. Method 1 GSIB Surcharge.\nSCB Proposal\nIn April 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to\nthe calculation of the Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)\nfor large bank holding companies, including the Firm.\nThe proposal aims to reduce SCB volatility by using\nthe average of supervisory stress results from the\nprevious two annual stress tests to calculate the SCB.\nThe proposal would also modify the annual effective\ndate of the SCB from October 1 to January 1 and make\ntargeted changes to reporting requirements to\nstreamline data collection. The proposal would be\neffective January 1, 2026.\nRefer to page 99 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for\ninformation on other Key Regulatory Developments.\n43\nSelected capital and RWA data\nThe following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics.

The following table\nsummarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s\naverage LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2025,\nMarch 31, 2025 and June 30, 2024 based on the Firm’s\ninterpretation of the LCR framework.\nAverage amount                                       June 30,                                          June 30,\n(in millions)                    Three months ended  2025                  March 31, 2025              2024\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nHQLA\nEligible cash(a)              $             349,403            $  389,423                  $  461,392\nEligible securities(b)(c)                   572,533               475,194                     356,815\nTotal HQLA(d)                 $             921,936            $  864,617                  $  818,207\nNet cash outflows             $             818,334            $  767,151                  $  732,179\nLCR                                             113  %                113  %                      112  %\nNet excess eligible           $             103,602            $   97,466                  $   86,028\nHQLA(d)\nJPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.:\nLCR                                             120  %                124  %                      125  %\nNet excess eligible HQLA      $             170,765            $  194,652                  $  189,124\n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, including the Federal Reserve Banks.

JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s\naverage LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2025 decreased compared with the three months ended March 31, 2025,\ndue to an increase in loans and client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets, largely offset by an\nincrease in deposits. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s average LCR for the three months ended June 30, 2025 decreased\ncompared with the three months ended June 30, 2024, driven by loan growth and dividend payments to the Parent\nCompany, predominantly offset by higher deposits and client-driven market-making activities in CIB Markets. Each of\nthe Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s average LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their\nrespective eligible HQLA and estimated net cash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the\nimpacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as other factors. Refer to pages 109-110 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form\n10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for additional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal\nstress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity stress testing to monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and\nits material legal entities under a variety of adverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the\nFirm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal stress tests are produced on a daily basis, and other stress\ntests are performed in response to specific market events or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in\nthe formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and assessment of its liquidity position. The Firm manages liquidity at\nthe Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding Company (“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to\ncomply with liquidity risk tolerances and minimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress\nwhen access to normal funding sources may be disrupted.\n50\nLiquidity sources\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and\ndebt securities, that the Firm believes would be\navailable to raise liquidity. This includes excess\neligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nthat are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The\nfair value of these securities was approximately $573\nbillion and $594 billion as of June 30, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, respectively, although the amount\nof liquidity that could be raised at any particular\ntime would be dependent on prevailing market\nconditions. The decrease compared to December 31,\n2024, was driven by a decrease in excess eligible HQLA\nsecurities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., largely\noffset by an increase in unencumbered CIB trading\nassets.\nThe Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4\ntrillion of available cash and securities as of June\n30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. For each\nrespective period, the amount was comprised of\neligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of\nregulatory haircuts, of approximately $970 billion and\n$834 billion, and unencumbered marketable securities\nwith a fair value of approximately $573 billion and\n$594 billion.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the\nFHLBs and the discount window at the Federal Reserve\nBanks as a result of collateral pledged by the Firm to\nsuch banks of approximately $422 billion and $413\nbillion as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. This borrowing capacity excludes the\nbenefit of cash and securities reported in the Firm’s\neligible HQLA or other unencumbered securities that\nare currently pledged at the Federal Reserve Banks\ndiscount window and other central banks. Although\navailable, the Firm does not view this borrowing\ncapacity at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window\nand the other central banks as a primary source of\nliquidity.\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banking organizations that is\nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable\nfunding that is sufficient to meet their “required”\namounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.\nFor the three months ended June 30, 2025, both the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with\nthe 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's\ninterpretation of the final NSFR rule. Refer to the\nFirm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report on the Firm’s\nwebsite for additional information.\n51\nFunding\nSources of funds\nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both\nshort- and long-term cash requirements.\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through\ndiverse sources of funding including deposits, secured\nand unsecured funding in the capital markets and\nstockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding\nsource for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through\nshort- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance\nof unsecured long-term debt, or from\nborrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank\nsubsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term\nunsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings\nwhich are primarily securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by\nTreasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term\nliquid investments based on their interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics.\nRefer to Note 22 for additional information on off-\nbalance sheet obligations.\nDeposits\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of June 30, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, and the average deposit balances for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nJune           Dec…\n30,            31,\n2025           2024                           Ave…\nThr…                               Six\nmon…                              mon…\nend…                              end…\nJune                              June\n30,                                30,\n(in                                          2025    2024                      2025    2024\nmi…\nCo…\n&      $  1,0…        $  1,0…                              $  1,0…    $  1,0…                $  1,0…    $  1,0…\nCo…\nBa…\nCo…\n&         1,2…           1,0…                                 1,1…       1,0…                   1,1…       1,0…\nIn…\nBa…\nAs…\n&         242…           248…                                 248…       227…                   246…       227…\nWe…\nMa…\nCo…       27,…           27,…                                 26,…       23,…                   26,…       22,…\nTo…    $  2,5…        $  2,4…                              $  2,5…    $  2,3…                $  2,4…    $  2,3…\nFi…\nThe Firm believes that deposits provide a stable\nsource of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on\nthe wholesale funding markets. A significant portion\nof the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and\nwholesale operating deposits, which are both\nconsidered to be stable sources of liquidity.\nWholesale operating deposits are generally considered\nto be stable sources of liquidity because they are\ngenerated from customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends than\nperiod-end deposit balances. However, during periods\nof market disruption, average deposit trends may be\nimpacted.\nAverage deposits increased for the three months ended\nJune 30, 2025 compared to the three months ended June\n30, 2024, reflecting the net impact of:\nan increase in CIB due to net inflows related to\nclient-driven activities in Payments and Securities\nServices, partially offset by net maturities of\nstructured notes in Markets,\nan increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances\nin new and existing client accounts, including the\nimpact of higher-yielding product offerings, and\na decrease in CCB in existing account balances\nprimarily driven by increased customer spending and\nmigration into higher-yielding investments, partially\noffset by new accounts.\nAverage deposits increased for the six months ended\nJune 30, 2025 compared to the six months ended June\n30, 2024, reflecting the net impact of:\nan increase in CIB due to net inflows related to\nclient-driven activities in Payments and Securities\nServices, partially offset by net maturities of\nstructured notes in Markets,\nan increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances\nin new and existing client accounts, including the\nimpact of higher-yielding product offerings, and\na decrease in CCB in existing account balances\nprimarily driven by increased customer spending and\nmigration into higher-yielding investments, partially\noffset by new accounts.\n52\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31, 2024,\nreflecting the net impact of: • an increase in CIB\npredominantly due to net inflows related to client-\ndriven activities in Securities Services and Payments,\nan increase in CCB primarily driven by new accounts,\nlargely offset by a decrease in existing account\nbalances due to seasonal tax outflows and increased\ncustomer spending, and • a decrease in AWM driven by\ncontinued migration into other investments and\nseasonal tax outflows, predominantly offset by growth\nin balances in new and existing client accounts,\nreflecting the impact of higher-yielding product\nofferings. Refer to the Firm’s Consolidated Balance\nSheets Analysis and the Business Segment & Corporate\nResults on pages 14-15 and pages 19-41, respectively,\nfor further information on deposit and liability\nbalance trends. Refer to Note 3 for further\ninformation on structured notes. Certain deposits are\ncovered by insurance protection that provides\nadditional funding stability and results in a benefit\nto the LCR. Deposit insurance protection may be\navailable to depositors in the countries in which the\ndeposits are placed. For example, the FDIC provides\ndeposit insurance protection for deposits placed in a\nU.S. depository institution. At June 30, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, Firmwide estimated uninsured\ndeposits were $1,555.5 billion and $1,414.0 billion,\nrespectively, primarily reflecting wholesale operating\ndeposits.\nThe table below presents an estimate of uninsured U.S.\nand non-U.S. time deposits, and their remaining\nmaturities. The Firm’s estimates of its uninsured U.S.\ntime deposits are based on data that the Firm\ncalculates periodically under applicable FDIC\nregulations.

These instruments are secured\npredominantly by high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and\ngovernment agency MBS. Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase increased at June 30, 2025,\ncompared with December 31, 2024, driven by Markets,\nreflecting higher secured financing of trading assets,\nhigher client-driven market-making activities, and the\nimpact of lower levels of netting, as well as when\ncompared with seasonally lower levels at year-end.\nThe increase in secured other borrowed funds at June\n30, 2025 from December 31, 2024, and for the average\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to\nthe prior year periods, was due to higher financing\nrequirements in Markets.\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due\nto investment and financing activities of clients, the\nFirm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its\nsecured and unsecured financing (for both the\ninvestment securities and market-making portfolios),\nand other market and portfolio factors.\nThe Firm’s primary sources of short-term unsecured\nfunding consist of issuances of wholesale commercial\npaper and other borrowed funds.\nThe decrease in commercial paper at June 30, 2025 from\nDecember 31, 2024 was primarily driven by strategic\nshort-term liquidity management.\n55\nLong-term funding\nLong-term funding provides an additional source of stable funding and liquidity for the Firm. The Firm’s long-term\nfunding plan is driven primarily by expected client activity, liquidity considerations and regulatory requirements,\nincluding TLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining diversification, maximizing market access and\noptimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various funding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its optimal\nlong-term funding plan.\nUnsecured funding and issuance\nThe significant majority of the Firm’s total outstanding long-term debt has been issued by the Parent Company to\nprovide flexibility in support of the funding needs of both bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The Parent Company\nadvances substantially all net funding proceeds to its subsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to external\ncounterparties. The increase in structured notes at June 30, 2025 from December 31, 2024, and for the average three\nand six months ended June 30, 2025, compared to the prior year periods, was primarily driven by net issuances of\nstructured notes in Markets due to client demand and an increase in the fair value of such instruments.\nThe following table summarizes long-term unsecured issuance and maturities or redemptions for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 108–115 and Note 20 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the IHC and long-term debt.\nL…       Th…\nu…       mo…                                                     Th…\nf…       en…                         Six                         mo…                        S…\n(…       Ju…                         mo…                         en…                        m…\nin       30,                         en…                         Ju…                        e…\nm…       Pa…                         Ju…                         30,                        J…\nI…       Co…  20…          20…       30,  20…          20…       Su…  20…         20…       3…  20…         20…\nS…\nn…\ni…\nin    $  6,…       $  9,…         $  14…       $  17…         $    —       $   —         $   —       $   —\nt…\nU…\nm…\nS…\nn…\ni…         —          1,…            2,…          4,…              —           —             —           —\nin\nn…\nm…\nT…\ns…       6,…          10…            16…          21…              —           —             —           —\nn…\nS…       951          734            2,…          1,…            16…          1…            3…          2…\nn…\nT…\nl…\nu…    $  6,…       $  11…         $  18…       $  23…         $  16…       $  1…         $  3…       $  2…\nf…\n–\ni…\nM…\nS…    $  8,…       $  9,…         $  17…       $  16…         $    —       $   —         $  65       $  65\nn…\nS…        17           22             17           35              —           —             —           —\nd…\nS…       466          293            837          510            11…          1…            2…          2…\nn…\nT…\nl…\nu…    $  9,…       $  9,…         $  18…       $  17…         $  11…       $  1…         $  2…       $  2…\nf…\n–\nm…\n(a) Includes certain TLAC-eligible long-term unsecured debt issued by the Parent Company.\nSecured funding and issuance\nThe Firm can also raise secured long-term funding through securitization of consumer credit card loans and FHLB\nadvances.

Reductions in these ratings could\nhave an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to\nliquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger\nadditional collateral or funding requirements and\ndecrease the number of investors and counterparties\nwilling to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude\nof the impact of ratings downgrades depends on\nnumerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the\nFirm\nbelieves are incorporated in its liquidity risk and\nstress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\npotential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings\ndowngrades.\nAdditionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs\nand other third-party commitments may be adversely\naffected by a decline in credit ratings.

Retained\nnonaccrual loans increased compared to December 31,\n2024, primarily driven by forbearances granted to\ncertain borrowers impacted by the wildfires in Los\nAngeles County, California in January 2025. Net\nrecoveries were lower for the three months ended June\n30, 2025 compared to the same period in the prior\nyear, driven by the absence of loan sales in the\ncurrent quarter. Loans held-for-sale decreased from\nDecember 31, 2024, reflecting loan sales. Nonaccrual\nloans held-for-sale increased from December 31, 2024,\nlargely driven by transfers from retained loans in\nanticipation of loan sales. Loans at fair value\nincreased compared to December 31, 2024, as purchases\noutpaced sales in CIB and originations outpaced\nwarehouse loan sales in Home Lending. At June 30, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, the carrying value of retained\ninterest-only residential mortgage loans was $88.6\nbillion and $88.9 billion, respectively. These loans\nhave an interest-only payment period generally\nfollowed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully\namortizing payment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance loans to\nhigher-income borrowers. The credit performance of\nthis portfolio is comparable to the performance of the\nbroader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value\nof retained home equity lines of credit outstanding\nwas $13.8 billion at June 30, 2025, including $3.6\nbillion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only\nto fully amortizing payments or have been modified,\nand $3.4 billion of interest-only balloon\nHELOCs, which primarily mature after 2030. The Firm\nmanages the risk of HELOCs during their revolving\nperiod by reducing or canceling the undrawn line in\naccordance with the contract or to the extent\notherwise permitted by law, including when there has\nbeen a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of\nthe borrower or significant decrease in the value of\nthe underlying property. The following table provides\na summary of the Firm’s residential mortgage portfolio\ninsured and/or guaranteed by U.S. government agencies,\npredominantly loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue. The Firm monitors its exposure to certain\npotential unrecoverable claim payments related to\ngovernment-insured loans and considers this exposure\nin estimating the allowance for loan losses.\nJune 30,          December 31,\n(in millions)                                2025              2024\nCurrent                              $  705            $  462\n30-89 days past due                      94                72\n90 or more days past due                113               121\nTotal government guaranteed loans    $  912            $  655\nGeographic composition and current estimated loan-to-\nvalue ratio of residential real estate loans Refer to\nNote 11 for information on the geographic composition\nand current estimated LTVs of the Firm’s residential\nreal estate loans.\n61\nAuto and other: The auto and other loan portfolio,\nincluding loans at fair value, generally consists of\nprime-quality scored auto and business banking loans,\nother consumer unsecured loans, and overdrafts. The\nsize of the portfolio increased when compared to\nDecember 31, 2024, predominantly driven by an increase\nin loans at fair value due to purchases of other\nconsumer unsecured loans in CIB. Net charge-offs\ndecreased for the three and six months ended June 30,\n2025 compared to the same periods in the prior year,\nprimarily due to lower scored auto net charge-offs,\nreflecting improved used vehicle valuations.\nNonperforming assets The following table presents\ninformation as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nabout consumer, excluding credit card, nonperforming\nassets.\nNonperforming assets(a)                            June 30,              December 31,\n(in millions)                                      2025                  2024\nNonaccrual loans\nResidential real estate                  $  4,401              $  3,665\nAuto and other                                268                   261\nTotal nonaccrual loans                      4,669                 3,926\nAssets acquired in loan satisfactions\nReal estate owned                              74                    78\nOther                                          37                    34\nTotal assets acquired in loan                 111                   112\nsatisfactions\nTotal nonperforming assets               $  4,780              $  4,038\n(a) Excludes mortgage loans past due and insured by\nU.S. government agencies, which are primarily 90 or\nmore days past due.

The June 30, 2025 30+\nand 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.06% and 1.07%,\nrespectively, decreased compared to the December 31,\n2024 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.17% and\n1.14%, respectively, in line with the Firm's\nexpectations. Net charge-offs increased for the three\nand six months ended June 30, 2025 compared to the\nsame period in the prior year reflecting loan growth.\nConsistent with the Firm’s policy, all credit card\nloans typically remain on accrual status until charged\noff. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan losses\nincludes the estimated uncollectible portion of\naccrued and billed interest and fee income. Refer to\nNote 11 for further information about this portfolio,\nincluding information about delinquencies.\nGeographic and FICO composition of credit card loans\nRefer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and\nFICO composition of the Firm’s credit card loans.\n63\nWHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO\nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating\nservices (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with\nbanks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on\nthe balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as\npart of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale\nportfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.\nRefer to the industry discussion on pages 66-69 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio\nincludes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale\nmethodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. As of June 30, 2025, loans increased by\n$62.7 billion, driven by higher loans in CIB, primarily in Markets, and higher securities-based lending in AWM,\nboth associated with higher client demand. Lending-related commitments increased by $28.2 billion, driven by higher\ncommitments in CIB. As of June 30, 2025, nonperforming exposure increased by $623 million, driven by Technology,\nMedia & Telecommunications, Utilities, and Oil & Gas, in each case resulting from downgrades, largely offset by\nReal Estate, primarily due to upgrades, paydowns and charge-off activity, and Healthcare, resulting from charge-off\nactivity. For the six months ended June 30, 2025, wholesale net charge-offs were $532 million, predominantly in\nHealthcare, Real Estate and Technology, Media & Telecommunications.\nWholesale\ncredit\nportfolio\n(in                       Credit  Jun 30,                Dec 31,                     Jun 30,            Dec 31,\nmillions)               exposure  2025                   2024          Nonperformi…  2025               2024\nLoans           $        740,675           $    690,396             $         4,479           $  3,942\nretained\nLoans                     12,383                  6,103                          59                  5\nheld-for-sa…\nLoans at                  31,951                 25,819                         614                964\nfair value\nLoans                    785,009                722,318                       5,152              4,911\nDerivative                60,346                 60,967                         349                145\nreceivables\nReceivables\nfrom                      53,099                 51,929                           —                  —\ncustomers(a)\nTotal\nwholesale                898,454                835,214                       5,501              5,056\ncredit-rela…\nassets\nAssets\nacquired in\nloan\nsatisfactio…\nReal estate                       NA                     NA                     199                206\nowned\nOther                             NA                     NA                       —                  —\nTotal assets\nacquired in                       NA                     NA                     199                206\nloan\nsatisfactio…\nLending-rel…             559,654                531,467                         922                737\ncommitments\nTotal\nwholesale       $      1,458,108           $  1,366,681             $         6,622           $  5,999\ncredit\nportfolio\nCredit\nderivatives\nand\ncredit-rela…\nnotes used      $        -39,285           $    -40,888             $             —           $      —\nin credit\nportfolio\nmanagement\nactivities(…\nLiquid\nsecurities\nand other\ncash                     -27,558                -28,160                              NA                 NA\ncollateral\nheld against\nderivatives\n(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB,\nCCB and AWM; these are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

Predominantly all of the\ncredit derivatives entered into by the Firm where it has purchased protection used in credit portfolio management\nactivities are executed with investment-grade counterparties. In addition, the Firm obtains credit protection\nagainst certain loans in the retained loan portfolio through the issuance of credit-related notes.\n(d) The maturity profile of retained loans, lending-related commitments and derivative receivables is generally\nbased on remaining contractual maturity. Derivative contracts that are in a receivable position at June 30, 2025,\nmay become payable prior to maturity based on their cash flow profile or changes in market conditions.\n65\nWholesale credit exposure – industry exposures\nThe Firm focuses on the management and diversification of its industry exposures, and pays particular attention to\nindustries with actual or potential credit concerns.\nExposures that are deemed to be criticized align with the U.S. banking regulators’ definition of criticized\nexposures, which consist of the special mention, substandard and doubtful categories. Total criticized exposure,\nexcluding loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value, was $48.5 billion and $44.7 billion as of June 30, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, representing approximately 3.6% and 3.5% of total wholesale credit exposure, respectively; of\nthe $48.5 billion, $42.7 billion was performing. The increase in criticized exposure was driven by Oil & Gas,\npredominantly due to a single new held-for-sale commitment, and Consumer & Retail, SPEs, and Banks & Finance\nCompanies, primarily resulting from downgrades, partially offset by Technology, Media & Telecommunications,\nresulting from net portfolio activity and upgrades.\nThe table below summarizes by industry the Firm’s exposures as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. The industry\nof risk category is generally based on the client or counterparty’s primary business activity.

The contractual amounts of these\nfinancial instruments represent the maximum possible\ncredit risk should the clients draw down on these\ncommitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations\nunder these guarantees, and the clients subsequently\nfail to perform according to the terms of these\ncontracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced, extended,\ncancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the Firm does not\nbelieve that the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm’s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for\nfurther information on wholesale lending-related\ncommitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment\nmargin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the\nclients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on\ndeposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable\ndebt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk,\nthe Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors\nthe required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.\nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to\ncollateral maintenance requirements is generally\nmitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of\nthe activity, the fair value of collateral held and\nthe Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s\nobligation to provide, additional margin when the fair\nvalue of the collateral declines. Because of these\nmitigating factors, these receivables generally do not\nrequire an allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses\nis required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses\nbased on the value of the collateral and probability\nof borrower default. These receivables are reported\nwithin accrued interest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\nRefer to Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on the Firm’s accounting policies\nfor the allowance for credit losses.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange\nand equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes\nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet these needs\nand uses derivatives to manage certain risks\nassociated with net open risk positions from its\nmarket-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The\nFirm also uses derivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk exposure. The\nnature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the\ncredit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-\nthe-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives, the Firm is exposed\nto the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For\nexchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures\nand options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-\ncleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to\nthe credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures\narising from derivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and\ncollateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s\nOTC derivative transactions subject to collateral\nagreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,\nwhich are not typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity and centrally\ncleared trades that are settled daily — was\napproximately 86% at both June 30, 2025 and December\n31, 2024. Refer to Note 4 for additional information\non the Firm’s use of collateral agreements and for a\nfurther discussion of derivative contracts,\ncounterparties and settlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets was $60.3 billion and\n$61.0 billion at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. The decrease was primarily as a result\nof market movements. Derivative receivables represent\nthe fair value of the derivative contracts after\ngiving effect to legally enforceable master netting\nagreements and the related cash collateral held by the\nFirm.\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the\nFirm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of\nliquid securities is consistent with the definition of\nhigh quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule. The benefits\nof these additional collateral amounts for each\ncounterparty are subject to a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement and limited to the net amount\nof the derivative receivables for each counterparty.\nThe Firm also holds additional collateral (primarily\ncash, G7 government securities, other liquid\ngovernment agency and guaranteed securities, and\ncorporate debt and equity securities) delivered by\nclients at the initiation of transactions, as well as\ncollateral related to contracts that have a non-daily\ncall frequency and collateral that the Firm has agreed\nto return but has not yet settled as of the reporting\ndate. Although this collateral does not reduce the\nreceivables balances and is not included in the tables\nbelow, it is available as security against potential\nexposure that could arise should the fair value of the\nclient’s derivative contracts move in the Firm’s\nfavor. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on\nthe Firm’s use of collateral agreements for derivative\ntransactions.\n71\nThe following tables summarize the net derivative receivables and the internal ratings profile for the periods\npresented.\nDerivative receivables                                  June 30,              December 31,\n(in millions)                                           2025                  2024\nTotal, net of cash collateral               $   60,346            $   60,967\nLiquid securities and other cash\ncollateral held against derivative             -27,558               -28,160\nreceivables\nTotal, net of liquid securities and         $   32,788            $   32,807\nother cash collateral\nOther collateral held against derivative          -949                -1,021\nreceivables\nTotal, net of collateral                    $   31,839            $   31,786\nRatings profile\nof derivative                                                              December 31,\nreceivables                June 30, 2025                                           2024\n(in millions,            Exposure net of    % of exposure net           Exposure net of    % of exposure net\nexcept ratios)                collateral        of collateral                collateral        of collateral\nInvestment-grade    $             21,248                   67  %    $            23,783                   75  %\nNoninvestment-g…                  10,591                   33                     8,003                   25\nTotal               $             31,839                  100  %    $            31,786                  100  %\nCredit portfolio management activities The Firm uses\ncredit derivatives for two primary purposes: first, in\nits capacity as a market-maker, and second, as an end-\nuser, to manage the Firm’s own credit risk associated\nwith traditional lending activities (loans and\nlending-related commitments) and derivatives\ncounterparty exposure in the Firm’s wholesale\nbusinesses.

The Firm's\nallowance for credit losses generally consists of:\nthe allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s\nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, • the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is reflected in accounts payable\nand other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which is reflected in\ninvestment securities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The\nallowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2025 was\n$28.3 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.4\nbillion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses included: • $1.0\nbillion in wholesale , predominantly driven by changes\nin credit quality of client-specific exposures, the\nimpact of new lending-related commitments, as well as\nthe impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average\nmacroeconomic outlook, and • $444 million in consumer\n, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting\nloan growth and the impact of changes in the Firm's\nweighted-average macroeconomic outlook. As of December\n31, 2024, the Firm's qualitative adjustments and its\nweighted-average macroeconomic outlook included\nadditional weight placed on the adverse scenarios to\nreflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks\nrelated to the geopolitical and macroeconomic\nenvironment. In the first quarter of 2025, the Firm\nfurther increased the weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios, and in the second quarter, the Firm\npartially reduced the increase in weight implemented\nin the first quarter. The Firm's allowance for credit\nlosses is estimated using a weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case\nassumptions provided in the following table, resulting\nin: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate\npeaking at 5.9% in the second quarter of 2026, and • a\nweighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.0%\nlower than the central case at the end of the fourth\nquarter of 2026.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s central case\nassumptions for the periods presented:\nCentral case assumptions\nat June 30, 2025\n4Q25       2Q26       4Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.6  %     4.8  %     4.5  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         0.6  %     1.0  %     2.1  %\nCentral case assumptions\nat December 31, 2024\n2Q25       4Q25       2Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.5  %     4.3  %     4.3  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.0  %     1.9  %     1.8  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate. (b) The year over year growth in\nU.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central\nscenario is calculated as the percentage change in\nU.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent\nchanges to this forecast and related estimates will be\nreflected in the provision for credit losses in future\nperiods.

Principal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments and are managed\nin the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended periods and,\naccordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-\nterm realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk Investment securities risk\nincludes the exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At June 30, 2025,\nthe size of the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was\n$742.8 billion, and the average credit rating of the\nsecurities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based\nupon external ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages 39-41\nand Note 9 for further information on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer\nto Liquidity Risk Management on pages 50-57 for\nfurther information on related liquidity risk. Refer\nto Market Risk Management on pages 77-83 for further\ninformation on the market risk inherent in the\nportfolio.\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments made\nto enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated on\nthe Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made\nby dedicated investing businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy. The Firm’s principal\ninvestments are managed by the LOBs and Corporate and\nare reflected within their respective financial\nresults. The Firm’s investments will continue to\nevolve based on market circumstances and in line with\nits strategic initiatives. The table below presents\nthe aggregate carrying values of the principal\ninvestment portfolios as of June 30, 2025 and December\n31, 2024.\n(in billions)                                       June 30, 2025             December 31, 2024\nTax-oriented investments, primarily in\nalternative energy and affordable          $  33.4                   $  33.3\nhousing\nPrivate equity, various debt and equity        9.7                       9.1\ninstruments, and real assets\nTotal carrying value                       $  43.1                   $  42.4\nRefer to page 140 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K\nfor a discussion of the Firm’s Investment Portfolio\nRisk Management governance and oversight.\n76\nMARKET RISK MANAGEMENT\nMarket risk is the risk associated with the effect of\nchanges in market factors such as interest and foreign\nexchange rates, equity and commodity prices, credit\nspreads or implied volatilities, on the value of\nassets and liabilities held for both the short and\nlong term. Refer to Market Risk Management on pages\n141–149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management\norganization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring\nand control, and predominant business activities that\ngive rise to market risk.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to measure\ncertain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in\nmarket conditions occur. For additional discussion on\nmodel uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form\n10-K.\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s\nexisting market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly\nover time.\nValue-at-risk\nJPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a\nstatistical risk measure, to estimate the potential\nloss from adverse market moves in the current market\nenvironment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used\nas a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming\na one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.\nFor risk management purposes, the Firm believes this\nmethodology provides a daily measure of risk that is\nclosely aligned to risk management decisions made by\nthe LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market\nrisk measures, provides the appropriate information\nneeded to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates\nseparately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with\nregulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to\nderive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital\nrequirements under Basel III.\nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling\ntechniques and measurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical comparisons of VaR\nresults. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form\n10-K for information regarding model reviews and\napprovals.\nRefer to page 143 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K\nfor further information regarding VaR, including its\ninherent limitations, and the key differences between\nRisk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR. Refer to\nJPMorganChase’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital\nDisclosures reports, which are available on the Firm’s\nwebsite, for additional information on Regulatory VaR\nand the other components of market risk regulatory\ncapital for the Firm (e.g., VaR-based measure,\nstressed VaR-based measure and the respective\nbacktesting). Refer to Other risk measures on pages\n146–149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further\ninformation regarding nonstatistical market risk\nmeasures used by the Firm.\n77\nThe table below shows the results of the Firm’s Risk Management VaR measure using a 95% confidence level.

With this refined time series, the average\nTotal VaR and each of the components would have been\nlower by the amounts reported in the following table:\nAmounts by which reported\naverage VaR would have been\nlower for the\n(In millions)                    periods ended:                          March 31, 2025           June 30, 2024\nCIB trading VaR by risk type:\nFixed                                                             $  -7                    $  -2\nincome\nCIB trading VaR                                                      -6                       -1\nCIB VaR                                                              -5                       -1\nTotal VaR                                                            -5                       -1\nQuarter over quarter results Average total VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2025 decreased by $8 million,\nwhen compared with March 31, 2025, due to the maturity of a client-driven equity position at the end of the first\nquarter of 2025. Additionally, the decrease in average Total VaR arising from the Firm's refinement of the\nhistorical proxy time series to one of its VaR models was offset by increases in the fixed income risk type. Year\nover year results Average total VaR for the three months ended June 30, 2025 decreased by $14 million compared with\nthe same period in the prior year due to decreased Visa Class C common share exposure in Corporate VaR, partially\noffset by market volatility in commodities.\n78\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR for the five trailing quarters. The movements in the second\nquarter of 2024 were primarily driven by changes in Visa Class C common share exposure in the Firm's Corporate VaR\nand the movements in the first quarter of 2025 were due to a client-driven equity position that has since matured.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\nSecond Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter    First Quarter    Second Quarter\n2024              2024             2024              2025             2025\n79\nVaR backtesting\nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily\ngains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below\ndo not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those\nassociated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk\nmanagement activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The\ndefinition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel\nIII capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior\nday. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent\nwith the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five\ntimes every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the\nstatistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially\ndifferent from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\nFor the 12 months ended June 30, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 167 of the 259 days, and observed 10\nVaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended June 30, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 37 of\nthe 65 days, and observed four VaR backtesting exceptions.\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12\nmonths and three months ended June 30, 2025. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the\ncorresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty\npercentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one\nhundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk\nsection of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR\napplied to the Firm’s covered positions.\nDistribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses\n80\nStructural interest rate risk management\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s\nreported net income is important as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.\nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading\nactivities which are included in VaR, but also from\nthe Firm’s traditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit facilities,\ntaking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the\ninvestment securities portfolio, and associated\nderivative instruments.\nRefer to the table on page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024\nForm 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate\nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest\nrates and, in the case of deposits, pricing\nassumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes\nto this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets\nand liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These\nsimulations primarily include retained and held-for-\nsale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and\nfinancing activities, investment securities, long-term\ndebt, related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer\npricing of other positions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as described on page\n142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. These\nsimulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar\nforeign exchange exposures arising from capital\ninvestments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange\nrisk on page 149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\nmore information.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a baseline, over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios\ninclude a parallel shift involving changes to both\nshort-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a\nsteeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates\nconstant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter\nyield curve involving increasing short-term rates and\nholding long-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These\nscenarios consider many different factors, including:\nThe impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline rates.\nForecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by the\nFirm or its clients and customers in response to\ninstantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other factors\nwhich are updated periodically based on historical\nexperience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in\nthe Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening\nand usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that\nrequire management judgment. The amount of deposits\nthat the Firm holds at any given time may be\ninfluenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as\nbroader monetary conditions and competition for\ndeposits.\nThe pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit\nrates paid could change upon a given change in market\ninterest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ\nfrom the modeled assumptions, primarily due to\ncustomer behavior and competition for deposits.\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the\nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,\nincluding with respect to deposit betas and forecasts\nof deposit balances, both of which are especially\nsignificant in the case of consumer deposits. The\nresults of these sensitivity analyses are reported to\nthe CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s\nsimulation and other factors.\nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures\nof the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s\nactual net interest income for the rate changes\npresented may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios\nare modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any\nactions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients\nor customers in response to rate changes. Other\nsignificant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk\nscenarios, including mortgage prepayments and deposit\nrates paid, may also differ from actual results. The\nFirm’s forecast for net interest income is included in\nthe Firm’s outlook on page 8.\n81\nThe Firm’s sensitivities are presented in the table\nbelow.\nDecember 31,\n(In billions)                            June 30, 2025(a)            2024(a)\nParallel shift:\n+100 bps shift in rates               $               1.8    $           2.3\n-100 bps shift in rates                              -2.0               -2.5\n+200 bps shift in rates                               3.4                4.6\n-200 bps shift in rates                              -4.7               -4.9\nSteeper yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in long-term rates                     1.1                1.0\n-100 bps shift in short-term rates                   -0.9               -1.4\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates                    0.7                1.2\n-100 bps shift in long-term rates                    -1.1               -1.1\n(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates, including hedges of non-U.S. dollar\ncapital investments. Non-U.S. dollar sensitivities were insignificant. The change in the Firm’s sensitivities as of\nJune 30, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024, was primarily driven by the net impact of Treasury and CIO actions,\npartially offset by the impact of changes in Firmwide deposits. Treasury and CIO actions primarily consisted of an\nincrease in cash flow hedges of floating rate loans and in investment securities activity, both of which added\nduration.\nEconomic value sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of\nearnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures economic value sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the\nlonger-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily\nretained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate\nscenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions\nfor loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk\nmanagement policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the\nEVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value measurement note to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. For example, certain assets and liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables\nand deposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held\nto maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 111 in Note 2.\n82\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to\nchanges in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on\npage 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other\nsensitivity-based measures.\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk. Where appropriate, instruments used for\nhedging purposes are reported net of the positions being hedged.

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios\nwhich may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified\ngiven the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 150–151 of JPMorganChase’s 2024\nForm 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table\npresents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of June 30, 2025 and their comparative\nexposures as of December 31, 2024. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by\nindividual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including\nclient activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The increase in exposure\nto Germany when compared to December 31, 2024 was driven by an increase in cash placed with the central bank of\nGermany predominantly due to higher client deposits.

The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates\nrequire management’s judgment to ascertain the\nappropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm has established policies and control\nprocedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,\nincluding any judgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently reviewed and\napplied consistently from period to period. The\nmethods used and judgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and\nthe related business and risk management strategies,\nwhich may vary across the Firm’s businesses and\nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures\nare intended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description of\nthe Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses generally comprises:\nThe allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\nThe allowance for lending-related commitments, and\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant\njudgment on a number of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,\nincorporation of historical loss experience,\nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and the\ndetermination of remaining expected life. Refer to\nNote 10 and Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K\nfor further information on these judgments as well as\nthe Firm’s policies and methodologies used to\ndetermine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and\nAllowance for credit losses on pages 73-75 and Note 12\nof this Form 10-Q for further information.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant for\nexposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty\nvariables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses vary by\nportfolio and geography.\nKey MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional\nU.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\nKey MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.\ninterest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil\nprices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S.\nHPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at\nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes\nin the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in\nany one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may not occur at the\nsame rate and may not be consistent across all\ngeographies or product types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such\nthat improvement in one factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its central and\nrelative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are\ntwo of the five scenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but\ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of\nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod.\nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario\nshown on page 73 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative\nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment\nrate, averaging approximately 1.8% higher over the\neight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of\napproximately 2.4% in the second quarter of 2026.\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses, for\na number of reasons, including:\nThe allowance as of June 30, 2025, reflects credit\nlosses beyond those estimated under the central\nscenario due to the weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios.\n85\nThe impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of\nfuture changes in portfolio composition and borrower\nbehavior can significantly affect the allowance for\ncredit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of\ncredit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of\nJune 30, 2025, the Firm compared the modeled estimates\nunder its relative adverse scenario to its central\nscenario. Without considering offsetting or correlated\neffects in other qualitative components of the Firm’s\nallowance for credit losses, the comparison between\nthese two scenarios for the exposures below reflect\nthe following differences: • An increase of\napproximately $950 million for residential real estate\nloans and lending-related commitments • An increase of\napproximately $3.4 billion for credit card loans • An\nincrease of approximately $5.2 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related commitments This analysis\nrelates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and\nis not intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime\nloss estimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the\nFirm believes that its process to consider the\navailable information and associated risks and\nuncertainties is appropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses were reasonable\nand appropriate for the period ended June 30, 2025.\nFair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of\nsuch assets and liabilities are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis, including trading assets and\nliabilities, AFS securities, structured note products\nand certain securities financing agreements. Certain\nassets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home\nequity and other loans, where the carrying value is\nbased on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nAssets measured at fair value The following table\nincludes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and\nthe portion of such assets that are classified within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied, including the\nnetting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n86\nValuation\nDetails of the Firm’s processes for determining fair\nvalue are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value\nrequires the application of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely dependent on the\namount of observable market information available to\nthe Firm. For instruments valued using internally\ndeveloped valuation models and other valuation\ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs\nand are therefore classified within level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates,\nprepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as commodity, equity or\ndebt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to\nNote 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs\nused.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The judgments made are\ntypically affected by the type of product and its\nspecific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity\nfor the product or within the market as a whole. In\nperiods of heightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the\nwider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs\nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position. Furthermore, while\nthe Firm believes its valuation methods are\nappropriate and consistent with those of other market\nparticipants, the methods and assumptions used reflect\nmanagement judgment and may vary across the Firm’s\nbusinesses and portfolios.\nThe Firm uses various methodologies and assumptions in\nthe determination of fair value. The use of\nmethodologies or assumptions different than those used\nby the Firm could result in a different estimate of\nfair value at the reporting date. Refer to Note 2 for\na detailed discussion of the Firm’s valuation process\nand hierarchy, and its determination of fair value for\nindividual financial instruments.\n87\nCredit card rewards liability\nThe credit card rewards liability was $15.5 billion\nand $14.4 billion at June 30, 2025 and December 31,\n2024, respectively, and is recorded in accounts\npayable and other liabilities on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets. Refer to pages 163-164 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a description of\nthe significant assumptions and sensitivities,\nassociated with the Firm’s credit card rewards\nliability.\nIncome taxes\nRefer to Income taxes on page 164 of JPMorganChase’s\n2024 Form 10-K for a description of the significant\nassumptions, judgments and interpretations associated\nwith the accounting for income taxes.\nGoodwill impairment\nManagement applies significant judgment when testing\ngoodwill for impairment. Refer to Goodwill impairment\non page 163 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a\ndescription of the significant valuation judgments\nassociated with goodwill impairment.\nRefer to Note 14 for additional information on\ngoodwill, including the goodwill impairment assessment\nas of June 30, 2025.\nLitigation reserves\nRefer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q, and Note 30 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a description of\nthe significant estimates and judgments associated\nwith establishing litigation reserves.\n88\nACCOUNTING AND REPORTING DEVELOPMENTS\nSummary of guidance                   Effects on financial statements\nRequires disclosure of income        •Required effective date: Annual\ntaxes paid disaggregated by 1)        financial statements for the year\nfederal, state, and foreign taxes     ending December 31, 2025.\nand 2) individual jurisdiction on     •The guidance is to be applied on a\nthe basis of a quantitative           prospective basis with\nthreshold of equal to or greater      retrospective application\nthan 5 percent of total income        permitted.\ntaxes paid (net of refunds            •The Firm plans to present the\nreceived).                            expanded income tax disclosures in\nRequires disclosure of the           its Consolidated Financial\neffective tax rate reconciliation     Statements for the year ending\nby specific categories, at a          December 31, 2025.\nminimum, with accompanying            •Required effective date: Annual\nqualitative disclosures, and          financial statements for the year\nseparate disclosure of reconciling    ending December 31, 2027, and\nFASB Standards Issued but not yet     items based on quantitative           interim financial statements for\nAdopted                               thresholds.                           the year ending December 31,\nStandard                              •Requires categories within the       2028.(a)\nIncome Taxes: Improvements to         effective tax rate reconciliation     •The guidance is to be applied on a\nIncome Tax Disclosures                to be further disaggregated if        prospective basis with\nIssued December 2023                  quantitative thresholds are met.      retrospective application\nIncome Statement - Reporting          •Requires additional                  permitted.\nComprehensive Income - Expense        disaggregation of specific types      •The Firm is evaluating the\nDisaggregation Disclosures:           of expenses within the Notes to       potential impact on the\nDisaggregation of Income Statement    the Consolidated Financial            Consolidated Financial Statements\nExpenses                              Statements on an annual and           disclosures, as well as the Firm’s\nIssued November 2024                  interim basis.                        planned date of adoption.\n(a) Early adoption is permitted.\n89\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nFrom time to time, the Firm has made and will make\nforward-looking statements.

(“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”),\na financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services\nfirm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial\nservices for consumers and small businesses,\ncommercial banking, financial transaction processing\nand asset management. Refer to Note 25 for further\ndiscussion of the Firm's reportable business segments.\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of\nJPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.\nGAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies\nconform to the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by regulatory authorities. The preparation\nof the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould be different from these estimates. In the\nopinion of management, all normal, recurring\nadjustments have been included such that this interim\nfinancial information is fairly stated. These\nunaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and related notes thereto\nincluded in JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K.\nConsolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements\ninclude the accounts of JPMorganChase and other\nentities in which the Firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated. Assets held for\nclients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm\nare not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included\non the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm\ndetermines whether it has a controlling financial\ninterest in an entity by first evaluating whether the\nentity is a voting interest entity or a variable\ninterest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of JPMorganChase’s accounting policies\nregarding consolidation.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same\ncounterparty and the related cash collateral\nreceivables and payables on a net basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also\npermits securities sold and purchased under repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowed or loaned under\nsecurities loan agreements to be presented net when\nspecified conditions are met, including the existence\nof a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nFirm has elected to net such balances where it has\ndetermined that the specified conditions are met.\nRefer to Note 1 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on offsetting assets and\nliabilities.\n96\nNote 2 – Fair value measurement\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\na discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for\nassets, liabilities and

160.3billion and $\n120.1billion, respectively, which were mortgage-related.\n(b) Physical commodities inventories are generally accounted for at the lower of cost or net realizable value. “Net\nrealizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction\ncosts”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial\nto the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical\ncommodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the\ncarrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost\nbasis is adjusted for changes in\n99\nfair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide\nconsistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each\nperiod presented.\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold\nbut not yet purchased (short positions).\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as\na practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At June 30, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real\nestate and other funds, were $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively, primarily reported in other assets.\n(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and\nthe related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level\n3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\nLevel 3 valuations\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a\ndetailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table\npresents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value\nof those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the\nweighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is\nbased on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be\nvalidated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are\nnot included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used\nto value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the\nweighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s\nestimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and\nthe relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may\nhave similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied\nvolatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input\nrange and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-\nparameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n100\nLevel 3\ninputs(…\nJune 30,\n2025\nFair    Principal                  Range of\nProduct…           value    valuation    Unobserv…        input

classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation\ntechnique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the\ncharacteristics of the instruments can differ.\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 365million, nonagency securities of $ 5million and\nnon-trading loans of $ 473million.\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 14million, trading loans of $ 65million and non-trading loans of $\n1.2billion.\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 803million and non-trading loans of $ 559million.\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are\nfinancial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured\nnotes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are\nbroadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 803million including $ 606million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are\nnot readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA\nmultiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and\nin aggregate.\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily\navailable, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed\nassuming a par value of $ 100.\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.\n101\nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of\nthe impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as\nwell as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range\nof inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The\nfollowing tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)\nfor financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level\n3, the determination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);\naccordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable\nfactors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3\nfinancial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or\nlosses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such\nlevel 3 instruments.\n102\n…                                                                                       C…\n…

Level 3\nliabilities at fair value as a percentage of total Firm liabilities at\n106\nfair value (including liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis) were 6% and 9% at June 30, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, respectively.\n(b) All level 3 derivatives are presented on a net basis, irrespective of the underlying counterparty.\n(c) Primarily reported in principal transactions revenue, except for changes in fair value for CCB mortgage loans\nand lending-related commitments originated with the intent to sell, and mortgage loan purchase commitments, which\nare reported in mortgage fees and related income.\n(d) Changes in fair value for MSRs are reported in mortgage fees and related income.\n(e) Realized (gains)/losses due to DVA for fair value option elected liabilities are reported in principal\ntransactions revenue, and were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024. Unrealized\n(gains)/losses are reported in OCI, and were $ 63million and $( 137) million for the three months ended June 30,\n2025 and 2024, respectively, and $( 10) million and $( 97) million for the six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024,\nrespectively.\n(f) Loan originations are included in purchases.\n(g) Includes financial assets and liabilities that have matured, been partially or fully repaid, impacts of\nmodifications, deconsolidations associated with beneficial interests in VIEs and other items.\nLevel 3 analysis Consolidated balance sheets changes The following describes significant changes to level 3 assets\nsince December 31, 2024, for those items measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Refer to Assets and\nliabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis on page 109 for further information on changes impacting\nitems measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. Three and six months ended June 30, 2025 Level 3 assets were\n$ 25.5billion at June 30, 2025, reflecting an increase of $ 1.3billion from March 31, 2025, and an increase of $\n1.7billion from December 31, 2024. The increase for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 was predominantly\ndriven by higher: • Gross derivative receivables of $ 1.4billion and $ 2.0billion, respectively, due to gains and\npurchases primarily offset by settlements. Refer to the sections below for additional information. Transfers\nbetween levels for instruments carried at fair value on a recurring basis For the three months ended June 30, 2025\nand 2024, there were no significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 or from level 3 into level 2. For the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2025, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included the following: • $ 819million\nand $ 1.0billion of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a\nresult of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of unobservable inputs. For the six\nmonths ended June 30, 2025, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2 included the following: • $ 793million\nand $ 904million of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative payables, respectively, as a\nresult of an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. • $ 1.1billion of\nlong-term debt driven by an increase in observability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs for\nstructured notes. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, significant transfers from level 2 into level 3 included\nthe following: • $ 759million and $ 798million of gross equity derivative receivables and gross equity derivative\npayables, respectively, as a result of a decrease in observability and an increase in the significance of\nunobservable inputs. For the six months ended June 30, 2024, significant transfers from level 3 into level 2\nincluded the following: • $ 987million of gross equity derivative payables as a result of an increase in\nobservability and a decrease in the significance of unobservable inputs. All transfers are based on changes in the\nobservability and/or significance of the valuation inputs and are assumed to occur at the beginning of the\nquarterly reporting period in which they occur.\n107\nGains and losses The following describes significant\ncomponents of total realized/unrealized gains/(losses)\nfor instruments measured at fair value on a recurring\nbasis for the periods indicated. These amounts exclude\nany effects of the Firm’s risk management activities\nwhere the financial instruments are classified as\nlevel 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to\nChanges in level 3 recurring fair value measurements\nrollforward tables on pages 102-107 for further\ninformation on these instruments. Three months ended\nJune 30, 2025 • $ 1.6billion of net gains on assets,\npredominantly driven by gains in net derivative\nreceivables due to market movements. • $ 2.7billion of\nnet losses on liabilities, predominantly driven by\nlosses in long-term debt due to market movements.\nThree months ended June 30, 2024 • $ 682million of net\ngains on assets, predominantly driven by gains in net\nderivative receivables due to market movements and\ngains in MSR reflecting lower prepayment speeds on\nhigher rates. • $ 1million of net losses on\nliabilities, driven by losses in deposits and short-\nterm borrowings predominantly offset by gains in\ntrading liabilities - debt and equity instruments and\nlong-term debt due to market movements.

Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect\nthe different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the\nFirm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held\nas of June 30, 2025 and 2024, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments\nrecorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes.

The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5342at June 30, 2025 and may be adjusted by\nVisa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation matters, and the\neffect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown. Accordingly, as of June\n30, 2025, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on Visa B-2 shares may be\nterminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result of these considerations,\nas well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar to Visa A shares, and are\nheld at their nominal carryover basis.\nSeparately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative\ninstruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the\nconversion rate. As of June 30, 2025, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 11.6million Visa B-2\nshares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.\nCarrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s\nexpected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and\ncarrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,\nmarket liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying\nvalue.\n(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.\nThe majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.

The\nprofit and loss information presented below only includes the financial instruments that were elected to be\nmeasured at fair value; related risk management instruments, which are required to be

Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the\nFirm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and\nlong-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for\nstructured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature\nembedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both\nnonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual\nprincipal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.\nAt June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair\nvalue option was elected was $ 14.5billion and $ 12.2billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $(\n6) million and $ 50million, respectively.

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash\ncollateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has\nobtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has\nnot been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\nthose derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables.\nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative\nreceivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).\nThese amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not\neligible for net presentation:\ncollateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are\nshown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables, up to the fair\nvalue exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;\nthe amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty\nlevel, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and\ncollateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal\nopinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from\nthe tables.\nJune

The Firm does not use notional amounts of credit\nderivatives as the primary measure of risk management for such derivatives, because the notional amount does not\ntake into account the probability of the occurrence of a credit event, the recovery value of the reference\nobligation, or related cash instruments and economic hedges, each of which reduces, in the Firm’s view, the risks\nassociated with such derivatives.\nTotal credit derivatives and credit-related notes\nMaximum\npayout/Notion…    Protection\namount    purchased with                                                     Other\nJune 30, 2025            Protection    identical                           Net protection            protection\n(in millions)                  sold    underlyings(c)                      (sold)/purcha…          purchased(e)\nCredit\nderivatives\nCredit default    $        -495,231                       $  522,624    $          27,393    $            6,612\nswaps\nOther credit               -226,549                          263,086               36,537                11,547\nderivatives(a)\nTotal credit               -721,780                          785,710               63,930                18,159\nderivatives\nCredit-related                    —                                —                    —                12,666\nnotes(b)\nTotal             $        -721,780                       $  785,710    $          63,930    $           30,825\nMaximum\npayout/Notion…\namount\nDecember 31,                           Protection                                                         Other\n2024                     Protection    purchased with                      Net protection            protection\n(in millions)                  sold    identical                           (sold)/purcha…          purchased(e)\nunderlyings(c)\nCredit\nderivatives\nCredit default    $        -450,184                       $  474,554    $          24,370    $            6,858\nswaps\nOther credit               -110,913                          137,927               27,014                10,169\nderivatives(a)\nTotal credit               -561,097                          612,481               51,384                17,027\nderivatives\nCredit-related                    —                                —                    —                10,471\nnotes(b)\nTotal             $        -561,097                       $  612,481    $          51,384    $           27,498\n(a) Other credit derivatives predominantly consist of credit swap options and total return swaps.\n(b) Predominantly represents Other protection purchased by CIB.\n(c) Represents the total notional amount of protection purchased where the underlying reference instrument is\nidentical to the reference instrument on protection sold; the notional amount of protection purchased for each\nindividual identical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower than the notional amount of protection\nsold.\n(d) Does not take into account the fair value of the reference obligation at the time of settlement, which would\ngenerally reduce the amount the seller of protection pays to the buyer of protection in determining settlement\nvalue.\n(e) Represents protection purchased by the Firm on referenced instruments (single-name, portfolio or index) where\nthe Firm has not sold any protection on the identical reference instrument.

Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted\nbased on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio\nhedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal\nprepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected\nmaturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield\nis calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for\ncredit losses of $ 35million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $ 1.1billion at June 30,\n2025. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $\n73million at June 30, 2025.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years\nor more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, six yearsfor agency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations, and five yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n137\nNote 10 – Securities financing activities\nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities\nfinancing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which\nthe fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and\ncollateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the\nFirm’s securities financing agreements as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024. When the Firm has obtained an\nappropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant\nnetting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances\noutstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges\nsecurities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but\nsuch collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an\nappropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with\nsecurities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in\nthe table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”\npresented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

Revolving loans that have\nbeen converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.\nThat is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than\nthe minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.\n143\nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential\nreal estate loans.\n(in millions, except weighted-average\ndata)                                          June 30, 2025          December 31, 2024\nNonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)                $          3,706       $              2,984\nCurrent estimated LTV ratios(e)(f)(g)\nGreater than 125% and refreshed FICO\nscores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                $             35       $                 72\nLess than 660                                              6                          3\n101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                             134                        161\nLess than 660                                              3                          5\n80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                           4,516                      4,962\nLess than 660                                             63                         73\nLess than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                         291,229                    294,797\nLess than 660                                          8,396                      8,534\nNo FICO/LTV available(h)                                 679                        906\nTotal retained loans                        $        305,061       $            309,513\nWeighted-average LTV ratio(e)(i)                          46  %                      47  %\nWeighted-average FICO(f)(i)                              774                        774\nGeographic region(h)(j)\nCalifornia                                  $        118,798       $            120,944\nNew York                                              46,348                     46,854\nFlorida                                               21,748                     21,820\nTexas                                                 14,364                     14,531\nMassachusetts                                         13,230                     13,511\nColorado                                              10,418                     10,465\nIllinois                                               9,445                      9,835\nWashington                                             9,368                      9,372\nNew Jersey                                             7,415                      7,554\nConnecticut                                            6,808                      6,854\nAll other                                             47,119                     47,773\nTotal retained loans                        $        305,061       $            309,513\n(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less costs to sell.

If the value of the underlying collateral\nimproves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 37million and $ 42million and $ 74million\nand $ 85million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.\nCurrent property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally\nrecognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted\ndata where actual data is not available.

The Firm's proprietary modification\nprograms as well as government programs, including\nU.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty including, but not limited to, interest\nrate reductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment deferral and principal\nforgiveness that would otherwise have been required\nunder the terms of the original agreement, are\nconsidered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's\n2024 Form 10-K for further information. Financial\neffects of FDMs For the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2025, retained residential real estate FDMs\nwere $ 923million and $ 977million, respectively,\nwhich included $ 887million and $ 902million,\nrespectively, of FDMs in the form of other-than-\ninsignificant payment deferrals. These other-than-\ninsignificant payment deferrals were driven by\nforbearances granted to certain borrowers impacted by\nthe wildfires in Los Angeles County, California in\nJanuary 2025 who were granted a second 90-day\nforbearance arrangement. The financial effects of the\nremaining FDMs, which were in the form of term\nextensions and interest rate reductions, included\nextending the weighted-average life of the loans by\n15and 16years, and reducing the weighted-average\ncontractual interest rate from 7.17% to 5.65% and\n7.25% to 5.82% for the three and six months ended June\n30, 2025. For the three and six months ended June 30,\n2024, retained residential real estate FDMs were $\n68million and $ 98million, respectively. The financial\neffects of the FDMs, which were predominantly in the\nform of term extensions and interest rate reductions,\nincluded extending the weighted-average life of the\nloans by 7and 10years, and reducing the weighted-\naverage contractual interest rate from 7.59% to 6.04%\nand 7.58% to 5.50% for the three and six months ended\nJune 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, additional\nunfunded commitments to lend to borrowers experiencing\nfinancial difficulty whose loans have been modified as\nFDMs were not material, while there were noadditional\nunfunded commitments as of December 31, 2024.

$ 1.0trillion and $ 964.7billion, respectively, for the\ncredit card portfolio segment; and $ 24.2billion and $ 32.6billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio\nsegment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.\n158\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of June 30, 2025 was $ 28.3billion,\nreflecting a net addition of $ 1.4billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses included: • $ 1.0billion in wholesale , predominantly driven by changes in credit quality of client-specific\nexposures, the impact of new lending-related commitments, as well as the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-\naverage macroeconomic outlook, and • $ 444million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting\nloan growth and the impact of changes in the Firm's weighted-average macroeconomic outlook. As of December 31,\n2024, the Firm's qualitative adjustments and its weighted-average macroeconomic outlook included additional weight\nplaced on the adverse scenarios to reflect ongoing uncertainties and downside risks related to the geopolitical and\nmacroeconomic environment. In the first quarter of 2025, the Firm further increased the weight placed on the\nadverse scenarios, and in the second quarter, the Firm partially reduced the increase in weight implemented in the\nfirst quarter. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally\ndeveloped macroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the\ncentral case assumptions provided in the following table, resulting in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate\npeaking at 5.9% in the second quarter of 2026, and • a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.0% lower than\nthe central case at the end of the fourth quarter of 2026.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s central case\nassumptions for the periods presented:\nCentral case assumptions\nat June 30, 2025\n4Q25       2Q26       4Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.6  %     4.8  %     4.5  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         0.6  %     1.0  %     2.1  %\nCentral case assumptions\nat December 31, 2024\n2Q25       4Q25       2Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.5  %     4.3  %     4.3  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.0  %     1.9  %     1.8  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the\nforecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated\nas the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from\nthe prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast\nand related estimates will be reflected in the\nprovision for credit losses in future periods.

The Firm\nconsiders a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorganChase is the primary beneficiary of the\nstructure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorganChase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments\nwith the JPMorganChase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorganChase–administered asset-backed commercial paper\nconduit.\nLine of Business            Transaction Type                              Activity    Form 10-Q page references\nCredit card                          Securitization of\nCCB                         securitization trusts           originated credit card                          160\nreceivables\nServicing and\nMortgage securitization     securitization of both                         160–162\ntrusts                      originated and purchased\nresidential mortgages\nSecuritization of both\nMortgage and other            originated and purchased\nCIB                         securitization trusts                  residential and                      160–162\ncommercial mortgages, and\nother consumer loans\nAssisting clients in\naccessing the financial\nMulti-seller conduits       markets in a                                       162\ncost-efficient manner and\nstructuring transactions\nto meet investor needs\nMunicipal bond vehicles     Financing of municipal                             162\nbond investments\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services to VIEs\nsponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 163–164 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third\nparties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the\nFirm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase\nIssuance Trust. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized)\noriginated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB\nand CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm\nmay act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\n160\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label\nsecuritization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or\nguarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value\nof these interests.

As of December 31, 2024, the Firm did not consolidate any\nFirm-sponsored private-label re-securitization VIEs.\nMulti-seller conduits In the normal course of business, JPMorganChase makes markets in and invests in commercial\npaper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. The Firm held $ 2.2billion and $ 2.9billion of the\ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs\nand capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued\nby the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and\ncredit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 11.4billion and $ 10.3billion at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to\nextend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal\nbond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their\nmunicipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer\nTOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party.

The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and\nexclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the\nConsolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial\ninterests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorganChase. Included in beneficial interests\nin VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.5billion at both June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement\nagent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual\ncredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,\nthe Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other\nprojects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing\nmember and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does\nnot consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and\nearns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. At June 30, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, the maximum loss exposure, represented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $\n35.0billion and $ 35.2billion, of which $ 14.5billion and $ 15.0billion was unfunded, respectively. The Firm\nassesses each project and to reduce the risk of loss, may withhold varying amounts\n163\nof its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more\ninformation on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm elected the proportional amortization method\nfor certain tax-oriented investments on a program-by-program basis. The proportional amortization method requires\nthe cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, be amortized in proportion to the tax benefits\nreceived with the resulting amortization reported directly in income tax expense, which aligns with the associated\ntax credits and other tax benefits. Investments must meet certain criteria to be eligible, including that\nsubstantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income tax benefits. In addition, under this\nmethod deferred taxes are generally not recorded as the investment is now amortized in proportion to the income tax\ncredits and other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity contributions that are unconditional and legally\nbinding or conditional and probable of occurring are recorded in other liabilities with a corresponding increase in\nthe carrying value of the investment. The guidance also requires a reevaluation of eligible investments when\nsignificant modifications or events occur that result in a change in the nature of the investment or a change in\nthe Firm's relationship with the underlying project. During the period, there were no significant modifications or\nevents that resulted in a change in the nature of an eligible investment or a change in the Firm's relationship\nwith the underlying project.\nThe following table provides information on tax-\noriented investments for which the Firm elected to\napply the proportional amortization method.\n(in millions)\nThree months\nended June 30,\nPrograms for\nwhich the Firm                   Alternative\nelected                           energy and\nproportional                      affordable                     Six months ended\namortization:     2025      housing programs  2024               June 30,          2025       2024\nCarrying                $             31,833        $  30,498                            $  31,833    $  30,498\nvalue(a)\nTax credits and\nother tax                              1,441            1,521                                2,799        2,787\nbenefits(b)\nInvestments that\nqualify to be\naccounted\nfor using\nproportional\namortization:\nAmortization\nlosses\nrecognized as a                       -1,048           -1,135                               -2,030       -2,151\ncomponent of\nincome tax\nexpense\nNon-income-tax-…\ngains/(losses)\nand other\nreturns received\nthat are                                  48               20                                   79           68\nrecognized\noutside of\nincome tax\nexpense(c)\n(a) Recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

In certain customer TOB transactions,\nthe Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a\nreimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the\nvehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party\nResidual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not\nhave any intent to protect Residual holders from\npotential losses on any of the underlying municipal\nbonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB\ntrusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make\ndecisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s\nmaximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer\nTOB trusts at June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was\n$ 6.8billion and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair\nvalue of assets held by such VIEs at June 30, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024 was $ 9.1billion and $ 8.1billion,\nrespectively.\n164\nLoan securitizations\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,\ncommercial mortgages and other consumer loans.\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not\nconsolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\nThree                                                  Six\nmonths                                               months\nended                                                ended\nJune                                                 June\n30,                                                  30,\n2025       Comme…         2024       Comme…          2025       Comme…          2024       Comme…\n(in         Resid…          and       Resid…          and       Reside…          and       Reside…          and\nmill…       mortg…       other…       mortg…       other…       mortga…       other…       mortga…       other…\nPrin…    $   6,430    $   2,006    $   4,471    $   4,886    $   10,954    $   4,840    $    9,393    $   7,244\nsecu…\nAll\ncash\nflows\nduri…\nthe\nperi…\nProc…\nrece…\nfrom\nloan     $   6,539    $   2,014    $   4,310    $   4,784    $   11,204    $   4,863    $    9,141    $   7,108\nsales\nas\nfina…\ninst…\nServ…\nfees             9           10            6            8            17           21            12           11\ncoll…\nCash\nflows\nrece…          184          147           92          165           304          426           162          295\non\ninte…\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Primarily includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for\nthe purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement\nof the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these\nloans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the\nsecuritization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of\nloan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the\npurchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and\nsecuritization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale\nof certain excess MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes the activities related\nto loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in\nsecuritization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae\nguidelines.\nThree months                              Six months ended June\n(in millions)                ended June 30,  2025            2024                          30,  2025       2024\nCarrying value of         $           5,900        $  6,630          $                  14,514        $  11,166\nloans sold\nProceeds received from\nloan sales as                           140              60                                778              366\ncash\nProceeds from loan\nsales as                              5,693           6,499                             13,586           10,691\nsecurities(a)(b)\nTotal proceeds\nreceived from loan        $           5,833        $  6,559          $                  14,364        $  11,057\nsales(c)\nGains/(losses) on loan    $               —        $      —          $                       —        $       —\nsales(d)(e)\n(a) Includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae\nthat are generally sold shortly after receipt or\nretained as part of the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio.

The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan\npools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable\nrequirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes\nexercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding\nliability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.\nThe following table presents loans the Firm\nrepurchased or had an option to repurchase, real\nestate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed\nresidential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s\nConsolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024.

For loans sold or securitized where servicing is the Firm’s\nonly form of continuing involvement, the Firm generally experiences a loss only if the Firm was required to\nrepurchase a delinquent loan or foreclosed asset due to a breach in representations and warranties associated with\nits loan sale or servicing contracts.\nN…\nl…\nl…\nT…                         Six\n90                          m…                         mo…\nJ…           De…       d…  Ju…           De…       e…                         en…\n…       S…  3…           31,       p…  30,           31,       J…                         Ju…\n…       a…  2…           20…       d…  20…           20…       3…  20…           2…       30,  2…           20…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n…\n/\n…    $  5…        $  5…         $  6…         $  5…         $   2         $   5        $    5        $   7\n&\n…\n…\n…       1…           1…            97            1…            -1             —             —            1\n…\n…       1…           1…            1…            1…            61            13           121           19\n…\n…\n…    $  1…        $  1…         $  2…         $  2…         $  62         $  18        $  126        $  27\n…\n166\nNote 14 – Goodwill, mortgage servicing rights, and\nother intangible assets\nRefer to Note 15 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\na detailed discussion of goodwill, mortgage servicing\nrights, and other intangible assets and the related\naccounting policies.

Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in capital\nrequirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative changes\nor increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s reporting\nunits to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a future period\nrelated to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of June 30, 2025, the Firm reviewed current economic\nconditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of business\nperformance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of June 30, 2025 or\nDecember 31, 2024, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the six months ended June 30, 2025 or\n2024.\n167\nMortgage servicing rights\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The\nfair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service\nthe loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the\nMSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or\nrecognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the\nvaluation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024.\n(in                 As of or for                                     As of or for\nmillions,              the three                                          the six\nexcept where              months                                           months\notherwise             ended June                                       ended June\nnoted)                       30,  2025              2024                      30,  2025              2024\nFair value\nat beginning    $          9,127          $  8,605                $         9,121          $  8,522\nof period\nMSR\nactivity:\nOriginations                  84                95                            195               153\nof MSRs\nPurchase of                    1               323                            280               325\nMSRs(a)\nDisposition                    3               -32          -e                  7               -27          -e\nof MSRs\nNet                           88               386                            482               451\nadditions/(…\nChanges due\nto\ncollection/…                -272              -263                           -533              -523\nof\nexpected\ncash flows\nChanges in\nvaluation\ndue to\ninputs and\nassumptions:\nChanges due\nto market\ninterest                      59               117                            -41               385\nrates and\nother(b)\nChanges in\nvaluation\ndue to other\ninputs\nand\nassumptions:\nProjected\ncash flows\n(e.g., cost                    —                 —                              1                 7\nto\nservice)\nDiscount                      -1                 —                             -1                 —\nrates\nPrepayment\nmodel                         -5                 2                            -33                 5\nchanges and\nother(c)\nTotal\nchanges in\nvaluation                     -6                 2                            -33                12\ndue to other\ninputs and\nassumptions\nTotal\nchanges in\nvaluation\ndue to                        53               119                            -74               397\ninputs\nand\nassumptions\nFair value      $          8,996          $  8,847                $         8,996          $  8,847\nat June 30,\nChanges in\nunrealized\ngains/(loss…\nincluded in     $             53          $    119                $           -74          $    397\nincome\nrelated to\nMSRs held\nat June 30,\nContractual\nservice\nfees, late\nfees and\nother                        412               395                            814               794\nancillary\nfees\nincluded in\nincome\nThird-party\nmortgage\nloans                        658               644                            658               644\nserviced at\nJune 30, (in\nbillions)\nServicer\nadvances,\nnet of an\nallowance                    440               524                            440               524\nfor\nuncollectib…\namounts, at\nJune 30(d)\n(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result\nof loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.\n(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,\nand the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.\n(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),\nwhich will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the\ntrust or the underlying loans. The Firm’s credit risk associated with these servicer advances is minimal because\nreimbursement of the advances is typically senior to all cash payments to investors.

The Firm’s intangible assets\nwith indefinite lives, such as asset management contracts, are not subject to amortization and are assessed\nperiodically for impairment. As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the net carrying values of other intangible\nassets consisted of finite-lived intangible assets of $ 1.5billion and $ 1.7billion, respectively, as well

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be\nrequired to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total\ncontractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of\nlending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected\ncredit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on\nlending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for\ncredit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying\nvalues of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at June 30,\n2025 and December 31, 2024. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business\nbanking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not\nexperienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at\nthe same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to the extent\notherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the\nborrower or significant decrease in the value of underlying property.\n179\nOf…\nsh…\nle…\nfi…\nin…       Co…\ngu…       am…\nand       Ju…                                                       Dec                    Jun             Dec\not…       30,                                                       31,    Car…            30,             31,\nco…       20…                                                       20…    val…            2025            2024\nEx…       Exp…       Ex…\nBy         in       aft…       af…       Exp…\nre…         1          1         3       aft…\nma…       ye…       year       ye…          5       To…       Tot…\n(in        or       thr…       th…       yea…\nmi…       le…          3         5\nyea…       ye…\nLe…\nCo…\nex…\ncr…\nca…\nRe…\nRe…    $  14…    $  6,5…    $  4,…    $  6,7…    $  31…    $  30,…                 $  408          $  534\nEs…\nAu…\nand       11…          1         4       3,7…       15…       14,…                     11              37\not…\nTo…\nco…\nex…       25…       6,5…       4,…       10,…       47…       44,…                    419             571\ncr…\nca…\nCr…       1,…          —         —          —       1,…       1,0…                      —               —\nca…\nTo…       1,…       6,5…       4,…       10,…       1,…       1,0…                    419             571\nco…\nWh…\nOt…\nun…\nco…       11…       187…       20…       24,…       52…       498…                    3,…             2,…\nto\nex…\ncr…\nSt…\nle…\nof\ncr…       15…       8,1…       4,…        534       28…       28,…                    674             473\nand\not…\nfi…\ngu…\nOt…\nle…       3,…        295        11        240       4,…       4,3…                     16              37\nof\ncr…\nTo…       13…       196…       20…       25,…       55…       531…                    3,…             3,…\nwh…\nTo…    $  1,…    $  202…    $  20…    $  36,…    $  1,…    $  1,5…                 $  4,…          $  3,…\nle…\nOt…\ngu…\nand\nco…\nSe…\nle…\nin…    $  36…    $     —    $    —    $     —    $  36…    $  310…                 $    —          $    —\nag…\nand\ngu…\nDe…\nqu…       1,…         86       9,…       37,…       48…       49,…                      9             113\nas\ngu…\nUn…\nre…\nand       15…       1,2…       1,…          —       15…       115…                      1               2\nse…\nbo…\nag…\nUn…\nre…\nand       99…        587         —          —       10…       66,…                      —              -2\nse…\nlo…\nag…\nLo…\nsa…\nand\nse…\nin…\nMo…\nre…        NA         NA        NA         NA        NA         NA                     46              45\nli…\nLo…\nso…        NA         NA        NA         NA       1,…       1,1…                     19              23\nwi…\nre…\nEx…\n&\ncl…\nho…       24…         NA        NA         NA       24…       401…                      —               —\ngu…\nand\nco…\nOt…\ngu…       10…       1,0…       458        774       13…       12,…                     27              28\nand\nco…\n(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CIB.\n(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d) As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations totaling\n$ 155million and $ 85million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $ 9.5billion at both\nperiods for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; $ 699million and $ 556million, respectively,\nfor other letters of credit. In regulatory filings with the Federal Reserve these commitments are shown gross of\nrisk participations.\n(e) As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, collateral held by the Firm in support of securities lending\nindemnification agreements was $ 388.5billion and $ 328.7billion, respectively. Securities lending collateral\nprimarily consists of cash, G7 government securities, and securities issued by U.S. GSEs and government agencies.\n(f) As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, includes guarantees to the Fixed Income Clearing Corporation under\nthe sponsored member repo program and commitments and guarantees associated with the Firm’s membership in certain\nclearing houses.\n(g) As of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024, primarily includes unfunded commitments to purchase secondary market\nloans, other equity investment commitments, and unfunded commitments related to certain tax-oriented equity\ninvestments.\n(h) For lending-related products, the carrying value includes the allowance for lending-related commitments and the\nguarantee liability; for derivative-related products, and lending-related commitments for which the fair value\noption was elected, the carrying value represents the fair value.\n(i) For lending-related commitments, the carrying value also includes fees and any purchase discounts or premiums\nthat are deferred and recognized in accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nDeferred amounts for revolving commitments and commitments not expected to fund, are amortized to lending- and\ndeposit-related fees on a straight line basis over the commitment period. For all other commitments the deferred\namounts remain deferred until the commitment funds or is sold.\n180\nOther unfunded commitments to extend credit Other unfunded commitments to extend credit generally consist of\ncommitments for working capital and general corporate purposes, extensions of credit to support commercial paper\nfacilities and bond financings in the event that those obligations cannot be remarketed to new investors, as well\nas committed liquidity facilities to clearing organizations. The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose\nfacilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees\nare conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a\nthird party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition\nfinancings, trade financings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of June 30, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\nDecember 31,\nJune 30, 2025                                     2024\nStandby                                           Standby\nletters of                                        letters of                              Other\n(in             credit and                       Other letters    credit and                            letters\nmillions)       other                                of credit    other                               of credit\nfinancial                                         financial\nguarantees                                        guarantees\nInvestment-…                     $  19,946    $          2,875                     $  20,443    $         3,380\nNoninvestme…                         8,691               1,457                         8,233                974\nTotal\ncontractual                      $  28,637    $          4,332                     $  28,676    $         4,354\namount\nAllowance\nfor                              $     236    $             16                     $      94    $            37\nlending-rel…\ncommitments\nGuarantee                              438                   —                           379                  —\nliability\nTotal\ncarrying                         $     674    $             16                     $     473    $            37\nvalue\nCommitments\nwith                             $  16,629    $            303                     $  16,805    $           357\ncollateral\n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 11 for further information on\ninternal risk ratings.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm\ntransacts in certain derivative contracts that have\nthe characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.\nRefer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on these derivatives.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives\nqualifying as guarantees as of June 30, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024.\n(in millions)                                      June 30, 2025               December 31, 2024\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees                   $  48,420                   $  49,628\nStable value contracts with                34,903                      32,939\ncontractually limited exposure\nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited        1,305                       1,740\nexposure\nFair value\nDerivative payables                             9                         113\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and\nseller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit\nderivatives.\nLoan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding litigation.\n181\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment\nnetworks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the\nFirm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,\nretains a contingent liability for disputed processed\ncredit and debit card transactions that result in a\ncharge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved\nin the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the\ncardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount\nto the cardholder and will charge back the transaction\nto the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the\namount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss\nfor the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder.\nThe Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future\nsettlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or\nobtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the\npayment or performance risk related to charge-backs.\nSponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a\nsponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term\nresale and repurchase agreements through the\nGovernment Securities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients\nthat become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.\nThe Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its sponsored member\nclients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s\nrules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these\nguarantees by obtaining a security interest in the\ncash or high-quality securities collateral that the\nclients place with the clearing house; therefore, the\nFirm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s\nmaximum possible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is included\nin the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and\ncommitments line on page 180. Refer to Note 11 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on credit risk mitigation practices on\nresale agreements and the types of collateral pledged\nunder repurchase agreements. Guarantees of\nsubsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain\nlong-term debt and structured notes of its\nsubsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial\nCompany LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance\nsubsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully\nand unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company\nand no other subsidiary of the Parent Company\nguarantees these securities. These guarantees, which\nrank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the\ntable on page 180 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nNote 23 – Pledged assets and collateral\nRefer to Note 29 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\na discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and\ncollateral.\nPledged assets\nThe Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to\nmaintain potential borrowing capacity at discount\nwindows with Federal Reserve banks, various other\ncentral banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm\npledges assets for other purposes, including to\ncollateralize repurchase and other securities\nfinancing agreements, to cover short sales and to\ncollateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nCertain of these pledged assets may be sold or\nrepledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and\nare parenthetically identified on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the\nFirm’s pledged assets.\n(in billions)                                           June 30, 2025                December 31, 2024\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or     $    235.8                   $    152.5\notherwise used by secured parties\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged         390.1                        297.9\nor otherwise used by secured parties\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks          714.6                        724.0\nand FHLBs\nTotal pledged assets                        $  1,340.5                   $  1,174.4\nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of\nconsolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for\nadditional information on assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 10 for additional\ninformation on the Firm’s securities financing\nactivities. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorganChase’s 2024\nForm 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s\nlong-term debt.\nCollateral\nThe Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that\nit is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or\notherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained\nunder resale and other securities financing\nagreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-\ninvestment customer receivables and derivative\ncontracts. Collateral is generally used under\nrepurchase and other securities financing agreements,\nto cover short sales and to collateralize derivative\ncontracts and deposits.\nThe following table presents the fair value of\ncollateral accepted.\n(in billions)                                           June 30, 2025                December 31, 2024\nCollateral permitted to be sold or          $  1,726.4                   $  1,544.0\nrepledged, delivered, or otherwise used\nCollateral sold, repledged, delivered or       1,350.2                      1,210.7\notherwise used\n182\nNote 24 – Litigation\nContingencies\nAs of June 30, 2025, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous\nevolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations,\nregulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions\ninvolving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations\nand regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and\nself-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or\ninvestigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of\nclaims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection\nclaims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to\napproximately $ 1.1billion at June 30, 2025. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was based\nupon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate of\nreasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can be\nmade, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves\nsignificant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that\nmany are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the\nFirm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of\nthe proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions\nconcerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties\nor regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are\ndescriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a\ndefendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian\nstate-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse)\nSA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB\nand paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company\nbetween 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the\nvalidity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by\n1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a\nnew claim in the future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals court is scheduled to\nhear both appeals in November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In\naddition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions\narising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons\nfor the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement\nDirectorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010\nand 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase entities into residential housing projects\ndeveloped by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential\nunits. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million,\nand the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making\npreliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore\nfunds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the\ninquiry.\n183\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government\nauthorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates\nto continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining\nFX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before\nthe South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related individual and\nputative class actions filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia\nremain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a\nrequest for class certification on an opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this decision to the U.K. Supreme\nCourt. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to\ncourt approval. In Australia, the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action. The\nsettlement is subject to Court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed\na series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set\nthe price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In\nSeptember 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively\ncontributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the\nsettlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action\nseeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class\ncertification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval\nof a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their\nrespective network rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are\nconsidering next steps. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed\nindividual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other\nbanks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who\nopted out representing over 80% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales volume. A\nnumber of these actions are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, and\nthat court has scheduled a trial of the claims brought by several merchants to begin in April 2026. LIBOR and Other\nBenchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from various governmental\nagencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s (“BBA”) London\nInterbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro Interbank\nOffered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Firm appealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm\nand other banks finding an infringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the\nEuropean General Court annulled the fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-\nimpose a fine in an identical amount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of\nJustice of the European Union. In addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in\nvarious individual and putative class actions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions\nrelated to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the period that it was administered by the BBA, the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York granted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and\ninterest rate swaps sold directly by the defendants, including the Firm. The Firm has obtained dismissal of certain\nactions and resolved certain other actions, and as to all remaining actions has moved for summary judgment. In\naddition, a lawsuit filed by a group of individual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm\nand other defendants were engaged in an unlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the\nmarket for LIBOR-based consumer loans and credit cards was dismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by the\nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in December 2024. In June 2025, the United States Supreme\nCourt denied these plaintiffs’ petition for certiorari. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions.\nRussian Litigation. The Firm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking\nof certain assets. These laws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are\nwithin the scope of the sanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened\n184\nlitigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm cannot make under, and is contractually excused from paying as\na result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the Firm and claims filed against other financial\ninstitutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties’ contractual agreements concerning forum selection and\ndid not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not making payment. Russian courts have entered judgment\nagainst the Firm in a number of claims, including one for $ 439million, and a judgment has been executed against\nassets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of the judgments exceeds the total amount of available\nassets that the Firm holds in Russia. Russian courts have nevertheless allowed plaintiffs to withhold dividends due\nto the Firm’s clients for the purpose of satisfying judgments, which the Firm is opposing as unlawful. The Firm\ncontinues to appeal the Russian courts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian\ncourts have also ordered interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank\naccounts, securities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a\ndetermination of certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the\nRussian courts and related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties’ contractual forum\nselections. If further claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders\nand to seek the proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and certain client\nassets could also be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. Shareholder\nLitigation . A shareholder derivative action purporting to act on behalf of the Firm is pending in the United\nStates District Court for the Eastern District of New York against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of\nits current and former officers relating to historical trading practices by former employees in the precious metals\nand U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions with the DOJ, CFTC\nand SEC in September 2020. Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaint. * * * In addition to the various legal\nproceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved\nin a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims\nasserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously.\nAdditional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves\nfor several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP\nfor contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal\nproceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or\ndownward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal\nexpense was $ 118million and $ 317million for the three months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, respectively. There is\nno assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very\nlarge or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of\nparties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual\noutcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines,\npenalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, based upon its current knowledge and\nafter consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking\ninto account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other\nlegal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated\nfinancial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings,\nthere is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it\nhas currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome\nof a particular matter may be material to JPMorganChase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on,\namong other factors, the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of JPMorganChase’s income for that\nperiod.\n185\nNote 25 – Business segments & Corporate\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are threereportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking,\nCommercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. The\nbusiness segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and\nthey reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose\nmembers act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a managed\nbasis. Refer to JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures on page 67 for a definition of managed basis and Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s\nbusiness segments. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the reportable business\nsegments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting\nprocess that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and\ntherefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are\nutilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business\nsegments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and\ncustomers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or\nbusinesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\nFunds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income\nand expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to\nTreasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics\nof assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in\nthe FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of\nnet interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect\nto consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest\nincome that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income. As a result of lower\naverage interest rates in the current year, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for\nliabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is\ntransferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and\nCIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is\nreferred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Note 32 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.\n186\nSegment & Corporate results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the\nthree and six months ended June 30, 2025 and 2024, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis\nstarts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for\nthe Firm (and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that\nreceive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable\ninvestments and securities. Refer to Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the\nFirm’s managed basis.\nS…\n&\nC…\nr…\na…\nr…\nAs\nof\nor\nf…\nt…\nt…\nm…\ne…\nJ…\n3…\n(…

In our opinion, the information set forth\nin the accompanying consolidated balance sheet\ninformation as of December 31, 2024, is fairly stated,\nin all material respects, in relation to the\nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has been\nderived.\nBasis for Review Results\nThese interim financial statements are the\nresponsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance\nwith the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim\nfinancial information consists principally of applying\nanalytical procedures and making inquiries of persons\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters. It\nis substantially less in scope than an audit conducted\nin accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the\nobjective of which is the expression of an opinion\nregarding the financial statements taken as a whole.\nAccordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\nAugust 5, 2025\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017\n189\nJPMorg…\nChase

Origination date LTV\nratios are calculated based on the actual appraised\nvalues of collateral (i.e., loan-level data) at the\norigination date.\nCurrent estimated LTV ratio: An estimate of the LTV as\nof a certain date. The current estimated LTV ratios\nare calculated using estimated collateral values\nderived from a nationally recognized home price index\nmeasured at the metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”)\nlevel. These MSA-level home price indices consist of\nactual data to the extent available and forecasted\ndata where actual data is not available. As a result,\nthe estimated collateral values used to calculate\nthese ratios do not represent actual appraised loan-\nlevel collateral values; as such, the resulting LTV\nratios are necessarily imprecise and should therefore\nbe viewed as estimates.\nCombined LTV ratio: The LTV ratio considering all\navailable lien positions, as well as unused lines,\nrelated to the property.

Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or\nmore of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)\na high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner\noccupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio\nabove normal limits. A substantial proportion of the\nFirm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not\nprovide complete documentation of his or her assets or\nthe amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an\nadjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the\nborrower with the option each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the introductory period.\nThis introductory rate is usually significantly below\nthe fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is\ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the\nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to the fully\nindexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements\nin the index.

Key differences in the calculation\nof credit risk RWA between the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,\ncredit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches\nwhich largely rely on the use of internal credit\nmodels and parameters, whereas for Basel III\nStandardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on\nsupervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by\ncounterparty type and asset class.

Where applicable, the fund rating providers\nredenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The\npercentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the\nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a\n“primary share class” level to represent the star\nrating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which\nNomura provides ratings at the fund level. The\nperformance data may have been different if all share\nclasses had been included. Past performance is not\nindicative of future results.\nPercentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets\nunder management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd\nquartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile\nrankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset\nvalues used to derive these rankings are sourced from\nthe fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based\non the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where\napplicable, the fund rating providers redenominate\nasset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM\nis based on fund performance and associated peer\nrankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled\nfunds, at a “primary share class” level to represent\nthe quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong\nKong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.\nThe performance data may have been different if all\nshare classes had been included. Past performance is\nnot indicative of future results.\n“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for\nEuropean funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and\nTaiwan funds. If these share classes are not\navailable, the oldest share class is used as the\nprimary share class.\n200",
