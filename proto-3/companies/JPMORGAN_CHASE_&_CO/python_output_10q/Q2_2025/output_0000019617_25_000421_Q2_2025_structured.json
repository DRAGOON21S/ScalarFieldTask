As a result of the agreement, the Firm made a\npayment of $609 million to the FDIC on January 31, 2025 and reduced its additional payable to the FDIC, which\nresulted in a gain of $588 million recorded in other income in the first quarter of 2025. Refer to Note 5 of this\nForm 10-Q and Note 34 on pages 319-321 of the Firm’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information. Comparisons noted\nin the sections below are for the first quarter of 2025 versus the first quarter of 2024, unless otherwise\nspecified. Firmwide overview For the first quarter of 2025, JPMorganChase reported net income of $14.6 billion, up\n9%, earnings per share of $5.07, ROE of 18% and ROTCE of 21%. The Firm's results included a $588 million First\nRepublic-related gain in Corporate. • Total net revenue was $45.3 billion, up 8%, reflecting: – Net interest income\n(\"NII\") of $23.3 billion, up 1%, driven by higher Markets net interest income, higher revolving balances in Card\nServices, the impact of securities activity including from prior quarters, and higher wholesale deposit balances.\nThese factors were predominantly offset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin compression, as well as\nlower average deposit balances in CCB. NII excluding Markets was $22.6 billion, down 2%. – Noninterest revenue\n(\"NIR\") was $22.0 billion, up 17%, predominantly driven by higher Markets noninterest revenue, a $588 million First\nRepublic-related gain, higher asset management fees in AWM and CCB, lower net investment securities losses in\nTreasury and CIO, and higher investment banking fees. • Noninterest expense was $23.6 billion, up 4%, driven by\nhigher compensation expense, including higher revenue-related compensation and growth in the number of employees.\nThe increase in expense was also driven by higher brokerage expense and distribution fees, and continued\ninvestments in technology and marketing, as well as the absence of a legal benefit from the prior year. These\nfactors were largely offset by the impact of an FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323 million compared\nwith an accrual increase of $725 million in the prior year. • The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion. Net\ncharge-offs were $2.3 billion, up $376 million, predominantly driven by Card Services, reflecting\n5\nthe seasoning of vintages originated in recent years.\nThe net addition to the allowance for credit losses\nwas $973 million and included $549 million in\nwholesale and $441 million in consumer , and was\nlargely driven by changes in the weighted-average\nmacroeconomic outlook.\nIn the prior year, the provision was $1.9 billion, net\ncharge-offs were $2.0 billion and the net reduction in\nthe allowance for credit losses was $72 million.\nThe total allowance for credit losses was $27.8\nbillion at March 31, 2025 . The Firm had an allowance\nfor loan losses to retained loans coverage ratio of\n1.94%, compared with 1.77% in the prior year.\nRefer to Consolidated Results of Operations and\nConsolidated Balance Sheets Analysis on pages 9-11 and\npages 12-13, respectively, for a further discussion of\nthe Firm's results, including the provision for credit\nlosses.\nPre-provision profit, ROTCE, TCE, TBVPS, NII and NIR\nexcluding Markets, and total net revenue on a managed\nbasis are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16 for a\nfurther discussion of each of these measures.\nThe Firm’s nonperforming assets totaled $9.1 billion\nat March 31, 2025 , up 10%, driven by higher wholesale\nnonaccrual loans, largely in Real Estate, concentrated\nin Multifamily and Lodging, reflecting downgrades,\npartially offset by lower consumer nonaccrual loans,\nwhich included loan sales. Refer to Wholesale Credit\nPortfolio and Consumer Credit Portfolio on pages 52-60\nand pages 49-51, respectively, for additional\ninformation.\nFirmwide average loans of $1.3 trillion were up 2%,\npredominantly driven by higher loans in CIB and AWM.\nFirmwide average deposits of $2.4 trillion were up\n2%, reflecting:\n– net inflows in Payments and Securities Services, and\n– growth in balances in new and existing client\naccounts in AWM,\npartially offset by\n– a decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in\nbalances in existing accounts due to migration into\nhigher-yielding investments and increased customer\nspending.\nRefer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages 40-46 for\nadditional information.\nSelected capital and other metrics\nCET1 capital was $280 billion, and the Standardized\nand Advanced CET1 ratios were 15.4% and 15.6%,\nrespectively.\nSLR was 6.0%.\nTBVPS grew 13%, ending the first quarter of 2025 at\n$100.36.\nAs of March 31, 2025 , the Firm had eligible end-of-\nperiod High Quality Liquid Assets (“HQLA”) of\napproximately $881 billion and unencumbered marketable\nsecurities with a fair value of approximately $635\nbillion, resulting in approximately $1.5 trillion of\nliquidity sources.

Refer to Note 5 for additional information. Quarterly results Investment banking fees increased, reflecting\nin CIB : • higher debt underwriting fees predominantly driven by elevated refinancing activity, particularly in\nleveraged finance, and • higher advisory fees predominantly driven by the closing of deals announced in 2024,\npartially offset by • lower equity underwriting fees as challenging market conditions resulted in lower fees. Refer\nto CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Principal transactions revenue\nincreased, reflecting in CIB: • higher Equity Markets revenue, particularly in Equity Derivatives, and • higher\nFixed Income Markets revenue, reflecting higher revenue in Rates, predominantly offset by lower revenue in\nCurrencies & Emerging Markets, and Securitized Products. Principal transactions revenue in CIB generally has\noffsets across other revenue lines, including net interest income. The Firm assesses the performance of its Markets\nbusiness on a total net revenue basis.\nRefer to CIB segment results on pages 22-26 and Note 5 for additional information. Lending- and deposit-related\nfees increased due to: • a reduction in client credits applied to deposit-related fees as well as increased volumes\nresulting in higher cash management fees in Payments, partially offset by • a decline in the amortization of the\nfair value discount on certain acquired lending-related commitments associated with First Republic, primarily in\nAWM, as certain of the commitments have expired. Refer to CIB and AWM segment results on pages 22-26 and pages\n27-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Asset management fees increased as a result of net\ninflows in AWM and higher average market levels in AWM and CCB. Refer to CCB and AWM segment results on pages 19-21\nand pages 27-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Commissions and other fees increased, largely\ndue to higher brokerage commissions and fees on higher volume, in both CIB and AWM. Refer to CIB and AWM segment\nresults on pages 22-26 and pages 27-29, respectively, and Note 5 for additional information. Investment securities\nlosses decreased, reflecting lower net losses compared to the prior year, which included sales of securities,\nprimarily U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and U.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment\nsecurities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to Corporate results on pages 30-31 and Note 9 for additional\ninformation. Mortgage fees and related income : refer to Note 14 for additional information. Card income was flat,\nreflecting, primarily in CCB, lower net interchange income and an increase in amortization related to new account\norigination costs, offset by higher annual fees. Refer to CCB segment results on pages 19-21 and Note 5 for\nadditional information.\n9\nOther income increased, reflecting: • a $588 million First Republic-related gain in Corporate, and • higher auto\noperating lease income due to an increase in origination volume in CCB. Refer to CCB and Corporate results on pages\n19-21 and pages 30-31, respectively, for additional information; and Note 5 for additional information on the First\nRepublic-related gain. Net interest income increased driven by higher Markets net interest income, higher revolving\nbalances in Card Services, the impact of securities activity including from prior quarters, and higher wholesale\ndeposit balances. These factors were predominantly offset by the impact of lower rates and deposit margin\ncompression, as well as lower average deposit balances in CCB. The Firm’s average interest-earning assets were $3.7\ntrillion, up $223 billion, and the yield was 5.19%, down 36 basis points (“bps”). The net yield on these assets, on\nan FTE basis, was 2.58%, a decrease of 13 bps. The net yield excluding Markets was 3.80%, down 3 bps.

There are three\nreportable business segments – Consumer & Community\nBanking, Commercial & Investment Bank, and Asset &\nWealth Management – with the remaining activities in\nCorporate.\nThe business segments are determined based on the\nproducts and services provided, or the type of\ncustomer served, and they reflect the manner in which\nfinancial information is evaluated by the Firm’s\nOperating Committee, whose members act collectively as\nthe Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment\nresults are presented on a managed basis. Refer to\nExplanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures on pages 15-16 for a\ndefinition of managed basis.\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\nResults of the reportable business segments are\nintended to present each segment as if it were a\nstand-alone business. The management reporting process\nthat derives business segment results includes the\nallocation of certain income and expense items. The\nFirm periodically assesses the assumptions,\nmethodologies and reporting classifications used for\nsegment reporting, and therefore further refinements\nmay be implemented in future periods. The Firm also\nassesses the level of capital required for each LOB on\nat least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide\nvarious business metrics which are utilized by the\nFirm and its investors and analysts in assessing\nperformance.\nRevenue sharing\nWhen business segments or businesses within each\nsegment join efforts to sell products and services to\nthe Firm’s clients and customers, the participating\nbusinesses may agree to share revenue from those\ntransactions. Revenue is generally recognized in the\nsegment responsible for the related product or\nservice, with allocations to the other segments or\nbusinesses involved in the transaction. The segment\nand business results reflect these revenue-sharing\nagreements.\nFunds transfer pricing\nFunds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which\nthe Firm allocates interest income and expense to the\nLOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary\ninterest rate risk and liquidity risk to Treasury and\nCIO.\nThe funds transfer pricing process considers the\ninterest rate and liquidity risk characteristics of\nassets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products.\nPeriodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized\nin the FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic\nconditions and other factors, which may impact the\nallocation of net interest income to the segments.\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm\nupdated its FTP with respect to consumer deposits,\nwhich resulted in an increase in the funding benefit\nreflected within CCB’s net interest income that is\nfully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the\nFirm’s net interest income.\nAs a result of lower average interest rates in the\ncurrent period, the cost of funding for assets and the\nfunding benefit earned for liabilities generally\ndecreased compared with the prior year.\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk is transferred from the LOBs and\nOther Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain\nrevenues and expenses. Treasury and CIO manages these\nrisks centrally and reports the impact of foreign\nexchange rate movements related to the transferred\nrisk in its results. Refer to Market Risk Management\non pages 65-70 for additional information.\nCapital allocation\nThe amount of capital assigned to each LOB and\nCorporate is referred to as equity. At least annually,\nthe assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to\nallocate capital are reassessed and, as a result, the\ncapital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may\nchange. Refer to Line of business and Corporate equity\non page 36, and page 104 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form\n10-K for additional information on capital allocation.\nRefer to Business Segment & Corporate Results –\nDescription of business segment reporting methodology\non pages 70–90 and Note 32 of JPMorganChase’s 2024\nForm 10-K for a further discussion of those\nmethodologies.\n17\nSegment &

Net revenue was $18.3 billion, up 4%. Net interest income\nwas $14.1 billion, up 3%, driven by: • higher Card Services NII, predominantly driven by higher revolving balances,\npartially offset by • lower NII in Banking & Wealth Management (\"BWM\"), driven by lower average deposit balances.\nNoninterest revenue was $4.2 billion, up 6%, driven by: • higher auto operating lease income as a result of higher\nlease origination volume, and • higher asset management fees reflecting higher average market levels, partially\noffset by • in BWM, the absence of other service fees associated with First Republic recorded in the prior year, as\nwell as • lower card income, driven by lower net interchange and an increase in amortization related to new account\norigination costs, largely offset by higher annual fees. The net interchange decreased as the impact of increased\ndebit and credit card sales volume was more than offset by higher rewards costs and partner payments. Refer to Note\n5 for additional information on card income, asset management fees and commissions and other fees; and Critical\nAccounting Estimates on pages 72–75 for additional information on the credit card rewards liability. Noninterest\nexpense was $9.9 billion, up 6%, reflecting: • higher noncompensation expense, predominantly driven by marketing,\nhigher auto lease depreciation on higher auto lease assets, and higher operating losses, as well as • higher\ncompensation expense, predominantly driven by an increase in the number of employees, primarily bankers and\nadvisors and employees in technology, as well as higher revenue-related compensation for advisors. The provision\nfor credit losses was $2.6 billion. Net charge-offs were $2.2 billion, up $275 million, predominantly in Card\nServices, reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years. The net addition to the allowance for\ncredit losses of $475 million was predominantly driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook.\n19\nIn the prior year, the provision was $1.9 billion, net charge-offs were $1.9 billion and the net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses was $34 million.

The net addition to the\nallowance for credit losses was $528 million and net\ncharge-offs were $177 million.\nIn the prior year, the provision was $1 million, net\ncharge-offs were $69 million and the net reduction in\nthe allowance for credit losses was $68 million.\nRefer to Credit and Investment Risk Management on\npages 47-64, Allowance for Credit Losses on pages\n61-63, and Critical Accounting Estimates on pages\n72–75 for a further discussion of the credit\nportfolios and the allowance for credit losses.\n23\nSelected metrics\n(in millions, except\nemployees)                                 As of or for the three\nSelected balance sheet                                     months\ndata (period-end)           2025                  ended March 31,        2024                  Change\nTotal assets                      $                     2,174,123              $  1,898,251               15  %\nLoans:\nLoans retained                                            497,657                   475,454                5\nLoans held-for-sale and\nloans at fair                                              48,201                    40,746               18\nvalue(a)\nTotal loans                                               545,858                   516,200                6\nEquity                                                    149,500                   132,000               13\nBanking & Payments loans\nby client\ncoverage segment\n(period-end)(b)\nGlobal Corporate Banking &\nGlobal                            $                       121,516    -c        $    129,179               -6  %\nInvestment Banking\nCommercial Banking                                        219,220                   223,474               -2\nMiddle Market Banking                                      74,334                    79,207               -6\nCommercial Real Estate                                    144,886                   144,267                —\nBanking\nOther                                                         260                       588              -56\nTotal Banking & Payments                                  340,996                   353,241               -3\nloans\nSelected balance sheet\ndata (average)\nTotal assets                      $                     2,045,105              $  1,794,118               14\nTrading assets-debt and\nequity                                                    685,039                   580,899               18\ninstruments\nTrading assets-derivative                                  58,987                    57,268                3\nreceivables\nLoans:\nLoans retained                    $                       482,304              $    471,187                2\nLoans held-for-sale and\nloans at fair                                              46,422                    43,537                7\nvalue(a)\nTotal loans                       $                       528,726              $    514,724                3\nDeposits                                                1,106,158                 1,045,788                6\nEquity                                                    149,500                   132,000               13\nBanking & Payments loans\nby client\ncoverage segment\n(average)(b)\nGlobal Corporate Banking &\nGlobal                            $                       121,147    -c        $    127,403               -5  %\nInvestment Banking\nCommercial Banking                                        218,560                   222,323               -2\nMiddle Market Banking                                      73,629                    78,364               -6\nCommercial Real Estate                                    144,931                   143,959                1\nBanking\nOther                                                         240                       590              -59\nTotal Banking & Payments          $                       339,947              $    350,316               -3\nloans\nEmployees                                                  92,755    -d              92,478                —  %\n(a) Loans held-for-sale and loans at fair value\nprimarily reflect lending-related positions originated\nand purchased in Markets, including loans held for\nsecuritization.

Revenue from Asset Management was $2.7\nbillion, up 15%, predominantly driven by higher asset management fees reflecting strong net inflows and higher\naverage market levels. Revenue from Global Private Bank was $3.1 billion, up 10%, driven by: • higher noninterest\nrevenue as a result of: – higher management fees due to strong net inflows and higher brokerage fees, partially\noffset by – a decline in the amortization of the fair value discount on certain acquired lending-related\ncommitments associated with First Republic that have expired, and • higher net interest income, largely driven by\nhigher average deposits.

The provision for credit losses was a net benefit of $10 million, compared with a net benefit of\n$57 million in the prior year. Refer to Note 5 for additional information on lending related fees.

(d) In the first quarter of 2025, 768 employees were transferred from the LOBs to Corporate\nas a result of the centralization of certain functions.\nQuarterly results Net income was $1.7 billion, compared with $676 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $2.3\nbillion, compared with $2.2 billion in the prior year. Net interest income was $1.7 billion, down 33%, driven by\nthe impact of lower rates and changes in the FTP for consumer deposits, partially offset by the impact of\nsecurities activity including from prior quarters. Refer to Business Segment & Corporate Results on page 17 for\nadditional information on FTP. Noninterest revenue was $653 million, compared with a loss of $275 million in the\nprior year, driven by: • a $588 million First Republic-related gain, and • lower net investment securities losses\ncompared to the prior year, which included sales of securities, primarily U.S. GSE and government agency MBS and\nU.S. Treasuries, associated with repositioning the investment securities portfolio in Treasury and CIO. Refer to\nNote 5 for additional information on the First Republic-related gain, and Note 9 and Note 12 for additional\ninformation on the investment securities portfolio and the allowance for credit losses. Noninterest expense was\n$185 million, down 86%, predominantly driven by: • the impact of an FDIC special assessment accrual release of $323\nmillion, compared with an accrual increase of $725 million in the prior year, and • the absence of restructuring\nand integration costs associated with First Republic recorded in the prior year. The provision for credit losses\nwas a net benefit of $19 million. In the prior year, the provision was $27 million. The current period income tax\nexpense was predominantly driven by changes in the level and mix of income and expenses subject to U.S. federal,\nstate and local taxes.

When the Firm extends a consumer or\nwholesale loan, advises customers and clients on their\ninvestment decisions, makes markets in securities, or\noffers other products or services, the Firm takes on\nsome degree of risk. The Firm’s overall objective is\nto manage its business, and the associated risks, in a\nmanner that balances serving the interests of its\nclients, customers and investors, and protecting the\nsafety and soundness of the Firm. The Firm believes\nthat effective risk management requires, among other\nthings: • Acceptance of responsibility, including\nidentification and escalation of risks by all\nindividuals within the Firm; • Ownership of risk\nidentification, assessment, data and management within\neach of the LOBs and Corporate; and • A Firmwide risk\ngovernance and oversight structure. The Firm follows a\ndisciplined and balanced compensation framework with\nstrong internal governance and independent oversight\nby the Board of Directors (the “Board”). The impact of\nrisk and control issues is carefully considered in the\nFirm’s performance evaluation and incentive\ncompensation processes. Risk governance framework The\nFirm’s risk governance framework involves\nunderstanding drivers of risks, types of risks, and\nimpacts of risks.

The minimum amount of\nregulatory capital that must be held by BHCs and banks\nis determined by calculating risk-weighted assets\n(\"RWA\"), which are on-balance sheet assets and off-\nbalance sheet exposures, weighted according to risk.\nUnder the rules currently in effect, two comprehensive\napproaches are prescribed for calculating RWA: a\nstandardized approach (“Basel III Standardized”), and\nan advanced approach (“Basel III Advanced”).\nFor each of these risk-based capital ratios, the\ncapital adequacy of the Firm is evaluated against the\nlower of the Standardized or Advanced approaches\ncompared to their respective regulatory capital ratio\nrequirements.\nAs of March 31, 2025, the Firm’s Basel III\nStandardized risk-based ratios continue to be more\nbinding than the Basel III Advanced risk-based ratios.\nAdditionally, Basel III requires that Advanced\nApproaches banking organizations, including the Firm,\ncalculate their SLRs.\nRefer to page 36 of this Form 10-Q and page 104 of\nJPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on SLR.\nKey Regulatory Developments\nIn April 2025, the Federal Reserve proposed changes to\nthe calculation of the Stress Capital Buffer (“SCB”)\nfor large bank holding companies, including the Firm.\nThe proposal aims to reduce SCB volatility by using\nthe average of supervisory stress results from the\nprevious two annual stress tests to calculate the SCB.\nThe proposal would also modify the annual effective\ndate of the SCB from October 1 to January 1 and make\ntargeted changes to reporting requirements to\nstreamline data collection. The proposal would be\neffective January 1, 2026.\nRefer to page 99 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for\ninformation on other Key Regulatory Developments.\n33\nSelected capital and RWA data\nThe following tables present the Firm’s risk-based capital metrics under both the Basel III Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches and leverage-based capital metrics.

For a further\ndiscussion of the Firm's liquidity risk management,\nrefer to pages 108–115 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form\n10-K and to the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports,\nwhich are available on the Firm’s website. LCR and\nHQLA The LCR rule requires that the Firm and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. maintain an amount of eligible HQLA\nthat is sufficient to meet their respective estimated\ntotal net cash outflows over a prospective 30\ncalendar-day period of significant stress. Under the\nLCR rule, the amount of eligible HQLA held by JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. that is in excess of its stand-alone\n100% minimum LCR requirement, and that is not\ntransferable to non-bank affiliates, must be excluded\nfrom the Firm’s reported eligible HQLA. The LCR for\nboth the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. is\nrequired to be a minimum of 100%. The following table\nsummarizes the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s\naverage LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2025,\nDecember 31, 2024 and March 31, 2024 based on the\nFirm’s interpretation of the LCR framework.\nAverage amount                                  March 31,                                             March 31,\n(in millions)               Three months ended  2025                   December 31, 2024              2024\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.:\nHQLA\nEligible cash(a)         $             389,423             $  396,123                     $  483,292\nEligible                               475,194                464,877                        313,818\nsecurities(b)(c)\nTotal HQLA(d)            $             864,617             $  861,000                     $  797,110\nNet cash outflows        $             767,151             $  763,648                     $  711,611\nLCR                                        113  %                 113  %                         112  %\nNet excess eligible      $              97,466             $   97,352                     $   85,499\nHQLA(d)\nJPMorgan Chase Bank\nN.A.:\nLCR                                        124  %                 124  %                         129  %\nNet excess eligible      $             194,652             $  193,682                     $  221,104\nHQLA\n(a) Represents cash on deposit at central banks, primarily the Federal Reserve Banks. (b) Eligible HQLA securities\nmay be reported in securities borrowed or purchased under resale agreements, trading assets, or investment\nsecurities on the Firm’s Consolidated balance sheets. For purposes of calculating the LCR, HQLA securities are\nincluded at fair value, which may differ from the accounting treatment under U.S. GAAP. (c) Predominantly U.S.\nTreasuries, U.S. GSE and government agency MBS, and sovereign bonds net of regulatory haircuts under the LCR rule.\n(d) Excludes average excess eligible HQLA at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. that are not transferable to non-bank\naffiliates.\nThe Firm’s average LCR increased during the three months ended March 31, 2025, compared with the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, primarily driven by dividend payments from JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to the Parent Company,\npredominantly offset by common stock repurchases and common stock dividends paid. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.’s\naverage LCR for the three months ended March 31, 2025 decreased compared with the three months ended March 31,\n2024, due to dividend payments to the Parent Company and loan growth, largely offset by activities in CIB Markets,\nan increase in deposits and a reduction in non-HQLA securities. Each of the Firm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.'s\naverage LCR may fluctuate from period to period due to changes in their respective eligible HQLA and estimated net\ncash outflows as a result of ongoing business activity and from the impacts of Federal Reserve actions as well as\nother factors. Refer to page 109 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K and the Firm’s U.S. LCR Disclosure reports for\nadditional information on HQLA and net cash outflows. Internal stress testing The Firm conducts internal liquidity\nstress testing to monitor liquidity positions at the Firm and its material legal entities under a variety of\nadverse scenarios, including scenarios analyzed as part of the Firm’s resolution and recovery planning. Internal\nstress tests are produced on a daily basis, and other stress tests are performed in response to specific market\nevents or concerns. Results of stress tests are considered in the formulation of the Firm’s funding plan and\nassessment of its liquidity position. The Firm manages liquidity at the Parent Company, the Intermediate Holding\nCompany (“IHC”), and operating subsidiaries at levels sufficient to comply with liquidity risk tolerances and\nminimum liquidity requirements, and to manage through periods of stress when access to normal funding sources may\nbe disrupted.\n40\nLiquidity sources\nIn addition to the assets reported in the Firm’s\neligible HQLA discussed above, the Firm had\nunencumbered marketable securities, such as equity and\ndebt securities, that the Firm believes would be\navailable to raise liquidity. This includes excess\neligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nthat are not transferable to non-bank affiliates. The\nfair value of these securities was approximately $635\nbillion and $594 billion as of March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, respectively, although the amount\nof liquidity that could be raised at any particular\ntime would be dependent on prevailing market\nconditions. The increase compared to December 31,\n2024, was driven by an increase in unencumbered CIB\ntrading assets, largely offset by a decrease in excess\neligible HQLA securities at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.\nThe Firm had approximately $1.5 trillion and $1.4\ntrillion of available cash and securities as of March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively. For each\nrespective period, the amount was comprised of\neligible end-of-period HQLA, excluding the impact of\nregulatory haircuts, of approximately $881 billion and\n$834 billion, and unencumbered marketable securities\nwith a fair value of approximately $635 billion and\n$594 billion.\nThe Firm also had available borrowing capacity at the\nFederal Home Loan Banks (\"FHLBs\") and the discount\nwindow at the Federal Reserve Banks as a result of\ncollateral pledged by the Firm to such banks of\napproximately $408 billion and $413 billion as of\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.\nThis borrowing capacity excludes the benefit of cash\nand securities reported in the Firm’s eligible HQLA or\nother unencumbered securities that are currently\npledged at the Federal Reserve Banks discount window\nand other central banks. Although available, the Firm\ndoes not view this borrowing capacity at the Federal\nReserve Banks discount window and the other central\nbanks as a primary source of liquidity.\nNSFR\nThe net stable funding ratio (“NSFR”) is a liquidity\nrequirement for large banking organizations that is\nintended to measure the adequacy of “available” stable\nfunding that is sufficient to meet their “required”\namounts of stable funding over a one-year horizon.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2025, both the\nFirm and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. were compliant with\nthe 100% minimum NSFR requirement, based on the Firm's\ninterpretation of the final NSFR rule. Refer to the\nFirm's U.S. NSFR Disclosure report for the quarterly\nperiods ended December 31, 2024 and September 30, 2024\non the Firm’s website for additional information.\n41\nFunding\nSources of funds\nManagement believes that the Firm’s unsecured and\nsecured funding capacity is sufficient to meet its on-\nand off-balance sheet obligations, which includes both\nshort- and long-term cash requirements.\nThe Firm funds its global balance sheet through\ndiverse sources of funding including deposits, secured\nand unsecured funding in the capital markets and\nstockholders’ equity. Deposits are the primary funding\nsource for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. Additionally,\nJPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may access funding through\nshort- or long-term secured borrowings, the issuance\nof unsecured long-term debt, or from\nborrowings from the IHC. The Firm’s non-bank\nsubsidiaries are primarily funded from long-term\nunsecured borrowings and short-term secured borrowings\nwhich are primarily securities loaned or sold under\nrepurchase agreements. Excess funding is invested by\nTreasury and CIO in the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio or deployed in cash or other short-term\nliquid investments based on their interest rate and\nliquidity risk characteristics.\nRefer to Note 22 for additional information on off-\nbalance sheet obligations.\nDeposits\nThe table below summarizes, by LOB and Corporate, the period-end deposit balances as of March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, and the average deposit balances for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nMarch                  December\n31, 2025               31, 2024                                  Average\nThree\nmonths\nended\nMarch\n31,\n(in                                                                   2025    2024\nmillio…\nConsum…\n&          $  1,080,1…            $  1,056,6…                                       $  1,053,677    $  1,079,2…\nCommun…\nBanking\nCommer…\n&             1,140,4…               1,073,5…                                          1,106,158       1,045,7…\nInvest…\nBank\nAsset &\nWealth         250,219                248,287                                            244,107        227,723\nManage…\nCorpor…         25,064                 27,581                                             26,363         22,032\nTotal      $  2,495,8…            $  2,406,0…                                       $  2,430,305    $  2,374,7…\nFirm\nThe Firm believes that deposits provide a stable\nsource of funding and reduce the Firm’s reliance on\nthe wholesale funding markets. A significant portion\nof the Firm’s deposits are consumer deposits and\nwholesale operating deposits, which are both\nconsidered to be stable sources of liquidity.\nWholesale operating deposits are generally considered\nto be stable sources of liquidity because they are\ngenerated from customers that maintain operating\nservice relationships with the Firm.\nThe Firm believes that average deposit balances are\ngenerally more representative of deposit trends than\nperiod-end deposit balances. However, during periods\nof market disruption, average deposit trends may be\nimpacted.\nAverage deposits increased for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025 compared to the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024, reflecting the net impact of:\nan increase in CIB due to net inflows related to\nclient-driven activities in Payments and Securities\nServices, partially offset by net maturities of\nstructured notes in Markets,\nan increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances\nin new and existing client accounts, reflecting the\nimpact of higher-yielding product offerings, and\na decline in CCB primarily driven by a decrease in\nbalances in existing accounts due to migration into\nhigher-yielding investments and increased customer\nspending, predominantly offset by new accounts.\nPeriod-end deposits increased from December 31, 2024,\nreflecting the impact of:\nan increase in CIB predominantly due to net inflows\nrelated to client-driven activities in Securities\nServices and Payments,\nan increase in CCB primarily driven by new accounts,\nand\nan increase in AWM as a result of growth in balances\nin new and existing client accounts, reflecting the\nimpact of higher-yielding product offerings,\npredominantly offset by continued migration into other\ninvestments.\nRefer to the Firm’s Consolidated Balance Sheets\nAnalysis and the Business Segment & Corporate Results\non pages 12-13 and pages 17-31, respectively, for\nfurther information on deposit and liability balance\ntrends. Refer to Note 3 for further information on\nstructured notes.\nCertain deposits are covered by insurance protection\nthat provides additional funding stability and results\nin a benefit to the LCR. Deposit insurance protection\nmay\n42\nbe available to depositors in the countries in which\nthe deposits are placed. For example, the FDIC\nprovides deposit insurance protection for deposits\nplaced in a U.S. depository institution.

These instruments are secured\npredominantly by high-quality securities collateral,\nincluding government-issued debt and U.S. GSE and\ngovernment agency MBS. Securities sold under\nagreements to repurchase increased at March 31, 2025,\ncompared with December 31, 2024, driven by Markets,\nreflecting higher client-driven market-making\nactivities, higher secured financing of trading assets\nand the impact of lower levels of netting, as well as\nwhen compared with seasonally lower levels at year-\nend.\nThe increase in secured other borrowed funds at March\n31, 2025 from December 31, 2024 and for the average\nthree months ended March 31, 2025, compared to the\nprior year period, was due to higher financing\nrequirements in Markets.\nThe balances associated with securities loaned or sold\nunder agreements to repurchase fluctuate over time due\nto investment and financing activities of clients, the\nFirm’s demand for financing, the ongoing management of\nthe mix of the Firm’s liabilities, including its\nsecured and unsecured financing (for both the\ninvestment securities and market-making portfolios),\nand other market and portfolio factors.\nThe Firm’s primary sources of short-term unsecured\nfunding consist of issuances of wholesale commercial\npaper and other borrowed funds.\nThe decrease in commercial paper at March 31, 2025\nfrom December 31, 2024 was primarily driven by\nstrategic short-term liquidity management.\nThe increase in unsecured other borrowed funds for the\naverage three months ended March 31, 2025, compared to\nthe prior year period, was primarily driven by net\nissuances of structured notes in Markets.\n44\nLong-term funding Long-term funding provides an\nadditional source of stable funding and liquidity for\nthe Firm. The Firm’s long-term funding plan is driven\nprimarily by expected client activity, liquidity\nconsiderations and regulatory requirements, including\nTLAC. Long-term funding objectives include maintaining\ndiversification, maximizing market access and\noptimizing funding costs. The Firm evaluates various\nfunding markets, tenors and currencies in creating its\noptimal long-term funding plan. Unsecured funding and\nissuance The significant majority of the Firm’s total\noutstanding long-term debt has been issued by the\nParent Company to provide flexibility in support of\nthe funding needs of both bank and non-bank\nsubsidiaries. The Parent Company advances\nsubstantially all net funding proceeds to its\nsubsidiary, the IHC. The IHC does not issue debt to\nexternal counterparties. The increase in structured\nnotes for the average three months ended March 31,\n2025, compared to the prior year period, was primarily\ndriven by net issuances of structured notes in Markets\ndue to client demand. The following table summarizes\nlong-term unsecured issuance and maturities or\nredemptions for the three months ended March 31, 2025\nand 2024. Refer to Liquidity Risk Management on pages\n108–115 and Note 20 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K\nfor additional information on the IHC and long-term\ndebt.\nLong-term\nunsecured\nfunding\n(Notional in            Three months\nmillions)            ended March 31,\nIssuance              Parent Company  2025             2024    Subsidiaries               2025             2024\nSenior notes\nissued in the     $            8,000        $   8,500                          $       —        $       —\nU.S. market\nSenior notes\nissued in                      2,084            2,173                                  —                —\nnon-U.S.\nmarkets\nTotal senior                  10,084           10,673                                  —                —\nnotes\nStructured                     1,079              868                             18,636           14,951\nnotes(a)\nTotal\nlong-term\nunsecured         $           11,163        $  11,541                          $  18,636        $  14,951\nfunding –\nissuance\nMaturities/re…\nSenior notes      $            8,525        $   7,168                          $      65        $      65\nSubordinated                       —               13                                  —                —\ndebt\nStructured                       371              217                             13,440           11,506\nnotes\nTotal\nlong-term\nunsecured         $            8,896        $   7,398                          $  13,505        $  11,571\nfunding –\nmaturities/re…\n(a) Includes certain TLAC-eligible long-term unsecured\ndebt issued by the Parent Company.\nSecured funding and issuance\nThe Firm can also raise secured long-term funding\nthrough securitization of consumer credit card loans\nand FHLB advances.

Refer to Note 14 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of client-driven loan securitizations.\n45\nCredit ratings\nThe cost and availability of financing are influenced\nby credit ratings. Reductions in these ratings could\nhave an adverse effect on the Firm’s access to\nliquidity sources, increase the cost of funds, trigger\nadditional collateral or funding requirements and\ndecrease the number of investors and counterparties\nwilling to lend to the Firm. The nature and magnitude\nof the impact of ratings downgrades depends on\nnumerous contractual and behavioral factors, which the\nFirm\nbelieves are incorporated in its liquidity risk and\nstress testing metrics. The Firm believes that it\nmaintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a\npotential decrease in funding capacity due to ratings\ndowngrades.\nAdditionally, the Firm’s funding requirements for VIEs\nand other third-party commitments may be adversely\naffected by a decline in credit ratings.

These amounts were excluded when calculating net charge-\noff/(recovery) rates.\n49\nConsumer, excluding credit card\nPortfolio analysis Loans decreased from December 31,\n2024 driven by lower residential real estate loans,\nincluding retained and at fair value, largely offset\nby higher loans at fair value in auto and other.\nResidential real estate: The residential real estate\nportfolio, including loans held-for-sale and loans at\nfair value, predominantly consists of prime mortgage\nloans and home equity lines of credit. Retained loans\ndecreased compared to December 31, 2024, driven by\npaydowns, net of originations. Net recoveries were\nhigher for the three months ended March 31, 2025\ncompared to the same period in the prior year, driven\nby loan sales. Loans held-for-sale and nonaccrual\nloans held-for-sale decreased from December 31, 2024,\npredominantly driven by loan sales. Loans at fair\nvalue decreased compared to December 31, 2024, driven\nby lower Home Lending loans, as warehouse loan sales\noutpaced originations, largely offset by an increase\nin CIB as purchases outpaced sales. Nonaccrual loans\nat fair value decreased compared to December 31, 2024,\npredominantly driven by loan sales in CIB. At March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the carrying value of\nretained interest-only residential mortgage loans was\n$88.7 billion and $88.9 billion, respectively. These\nloans have an interest-only payment period generally\nfollowed by an adjustable-rate or fixed-rate fully\namortizing payment period to maturity and are\ntypically originated as higher-balance loans to\nhigher-income borrowers. The credit performance of\nthis portfolio is comparable to the performance of the\nbroader prime mortgage portfolio. The carrying value\nof retained home equity lines of credit outstanding\nwas $13.9 billion at March 31, 2025, including $3.7\nbillion of HELOCs that have recast from interest-only\nto fully amortizing payments or have been modified,\nand $3.5 billion of interest-only balloon HELOCs,\nwhich primarily mature after 2030. The Firm manages\nthe risk of HELOCs during their revolving period by\nreducing or canceling the undrawn line in accordance\nwith the contract or to the extent otherwise permitted\nby law, including when there has been a demonstrable\ndecline in the creditworthiness of the borrower or\nsignificant decrease in the value of the underlying\nproperty.\nThe following table provides a summary of the Firm’s\nresidential mortgage portfolio insured and/or\nguaranteed by U.S. government agencies, predominantly\nloans held-for-sale and loans at fair value.

The\nportfolio increased when compared to December 31,\n2024, predominantly driven by an increase in loans at\nfair value due to purchases of other consumer\nunsecured loans in CIB.

The\nMarch 31, 2025 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.21% and 1.16%, respectively, increased compared to the\nDecember 31, 2024 30+ and 90+ day delinquency rates of 2.17% and 1.14%, respectively, in line with the Firm's\nexpectations. Net charge-offs increased for the three months ended March 31, 2025 compared to the same period in\nthe prior year reflecting the seasoning of vintages originated in recent years. Consistent with the Firm’s policy,\nall credit card loans typically remain on accrual status until charged off. However, the Firm’s allowance for loan\nlosses includes the estimated uncollectible portion of accrued and billed interest and fee income.

Geographic and FICO\ncomposition of credit card loans Refer to Note 11 for information on the geographic and FICO composition of the\nFirm’s credit card loans.\n51\nWHOLESALE CREDIT PORTFOLIO\nIn its wholesale businesses, the Firm is exposed to credit risk primarily through its underwriting, lending,\nmarket-making, and hedging activities with and for clients and counterparties, as well as through various operating\nservices (such as cash management and clearing activities), securities financing activities and cash placed with\nbanks. A portion of the loans originated or acquired by the Firm’s wholesale businesses is generally retained on\nthe balance sheet. The Firm distributes a significant percentage of the loans that it originates into the market as\npart of its syndicated loan business and to manage portfolio concentrations and credit risk. The wholesale\nportfolio is actively managed, in part by conducting ongoing, in-depth reviews of client credit quality and\ntransaction structure inclusive of collateral where applicable, and of industry, product and client concentrations.\nRefer to the industry discussion on pages 54-57 for further information. The Firm’s wholesale credit portfolio\nincludes exposure held in CIB, AWM and Corporate, and risk-rated exposure held in CCB, for which the wholesale\nmethodology is applied when determining the allowance for loan losses. As of March 31, 2025, loans increased $18.9\nbillion, predominantly driven by higher loans in CIB Markets. Lending-related commitments increased $17.4 billion\ndriven by higher commitments in CIB. As of March 31, 2025, nonperforming exposure was relatively flat, with\nincreases in Technology, Media & Telecommunications and Consumer & Retail, reflecting downgrades and a new held-\nfor-sale loan, predominantly offset by Real Estate, concentrated in Office, resulting from upgrades and paydowns.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2025, wholesale net charge-offs were $187 million across multiple industries,\nincluding Real Estate and Healthcare.\nWholesale\ncredit\nportfolio\n(in                       Credit  Mar 31,                Dec 31,                     Mar 31,            Dec 31,\nmillions)               exposure  2025                   2024          Nonperformi…  2025               2024\nLoans           $        704,714           $    690,396             $         3,895           $  3,942\nretained\nLoans                      9,437                  6,103                         248                  5\nheld-for-sa…\nLoans at                  27,022                 25,819                         716                964\nfair value\nLoans                    741,173                722,318                       4,859              4,911\nDerivative                60,539                 60,967                         169                145\nreceivables\nReceivables\nfrom                      49,403                 51,929                           —                  —\ncustomers(a)\nTotal\nwholesale                851,115                835,214                       5,028              5,056\ncredit-rela…\nassets\nAssets\nacquired in\nloan\nsatisfactio…\nReal estate                       NA                     NA                     202                206\nowned\nOther                             NA                     NA                       —                  —\nTotal assets\nacquired in                       NA                     NA                     202                206\nloan\nsatisfactio…\nLending-rel…             548,853                531,467                         793                737\ncommitments\nTotal\nwholesale       $      1,399,968           $  1,366,681             $         6,023           $  5,999\ncredit\nportfolio\nCredit\nderivatives\nand\ncredit-rela…\nnotes used      $        -40,095           $    -40,888             $             —           $      —\nin credit\nportfolio\nmanagement\nactivities(…\nLiquid\nsecurities\nand other\ncash                     -27,290                -28,160                              NA                 NA\ncollateral\nheld against\nderivatives\n(a) Receivables from customers reflect held-for-\ninvestment margin loans to brokerage clients in CIB,\nCCB and AWM; these are reported within accrued\ninterest and accounts receivable on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

The contractual amounts of these\nfinancial instruments represent the maximum possible\ncredit risk should the clients draw down on these\ncommitments or when the Firm fulfills its obligations\nunder these guarantees, and the clients subsequently\nfail to perform according to the terms of these\ncontracts. Most of these commitments and guarantees\nhave historically been refinanced, extended,\ncancelled, or expired without being drawn upon or a\ndefault occurring. As a result, the Firm does not\nbelieve that the total contractual amount of these\nwholesale lending-related commitments is\nrepresentative of the Firm’s expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 22 for\nfurther information on wholesale lending-related\ncommitments.\nReceivables from customers\nReceivables from customers reflect held-for-investment\nmargin loans to brokerage clients in CIB, CCB and AWM\nthat are collateralized by assets maintained in the\nclients’ brokerage accounts (including cash on\ndeposit, and primarily liquid and readily marketable\ndebt or equity securities). To manage its credit risk,\nthe Firm establishes margin requirements and monitors\nthe required margin levels on an ongoing basis, and\nrequires clients to deposit additional cash or other\ncollateral, or to reduce positions, when appropriate.\nCredit risk arising from lending activities subject to\ncollateral maintenance requirements is generally\nmitigated by factors such as the short-term nature of\nthe activity, the fair value of collateral held and\nthe Firm’s right to call for, and the borrower’s\nobligation to provide, additional margin when the fair\nvalue of the collateral declines. Because of these\nmitigating factors, these receivables generally do not\nrequire an allowance for credit losses. However, if in\nmanagement’s judgment, an allowance for credit losses\nis required, the Firm estimates expected credit losses\nbased on the value of the collateral and probability\nof borrower default. These receivables are reported\nwithin accrued interest and accounts receivable on the\nFirm’s Consolidated balance sheets.\nRefer to Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on the Firm’s accounting policies\nfor the allowance for credit losses.\nDerivative contracts\nDerivatives enable clients and counterparties to\nmanage risk, including credit risk and risks arising\nfrom fluctuations in interest rates, foreign exchange\nand equities and commodities prices. The Firm makes\nmarkets in derivatives in order to meet these needs\nand uses derivatives to manage certain risks\nassociated with net open risk positions from its\nmarket-making activities, including the counterparty\ncredit risk arising from derivative receivables. The\nFirm also uses derivative instruments to manage its\nown credit risk and other market risk exposure. The\nnature of the counterparty and the settlement\nmechanism of the derivative affect the\ncredit risk to which the Firm is exposed. For over-\nthe-counter (\"OTC\") derivatives, the Firm is exposed\nto the credit risk of the derivative counterparty. For\nexchange-traded derivatives (“ETD”), such as futures\nand options, and cleared over-the-counter (“OTC-\ncleared”) derivatives, the Firm can also be exposed to\nthe credit risk of the relevant CCP. Where possible,\nthe Firm seeks to mitigate its credit risk exposures\narising from derivative contracts through the use of\nlegally enforceable master netting arrangements and\ncollateral agreements. The percentage of the Firm’s\nOTC derivative transactions subject to collateral\nagreements — excluding foreign exchange spot trades,\nwhich are not typically covered by collateral\nagreements due to their short maturity and centrally\ncleared trades that are settled daily — was\napproximately 85% and 86% at March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024, respectively. Refer to Note 4 for\nadditional information on the Firm’s use of collateral\nagreements and for a further discussion of derivative\ncontracts, counterparties and settlement types.\nThe fair value of derivative receivables reported on\nthe Consolidated balance sheets was $60.5 billion and\n$61.0 billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively. The decrease was primarily as a result\nof market movements. Derivative receivables represent\nthe fair value of the derivative contracts after\ngiving effect to legally enforceable master netting\nagreements and the related cash collateral held by the\nFirm.\nIn addition, the Firm holds liquid securities and\nother cash collateral that may be used as security\nwhen the fair value of the client’s exposure is in the\nFirm’s favor. For these purposes, the definition of\nliquid securities is consistent with the definition of\nhigh quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule.\nIn management’s view, the appropriate measure of\ncurrent credit risk should also take into\nconsideration other collateral, which generally\nrepresents securities that do not qualify as high\nquality liquid assets under the LCR rule.

The Firm's\nallowance for credit losses generally consists of:\nthe allowance for loan losses, which covers the Firm’s\nretained loan portfolios (scored and risk-rated) and\nis presented separately on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, • the allowance for lending-related\ncommitments, which is reflected in accounts payable\nand other liabilities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets, and • the allowance for credit losses on\ninvestment securities, which is reflected in\ninvestment securities on the Consolidated balance\nsheets. Discussion of changes in the allowance The\nallowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2025 was\n$27.8 billion, reflecting a net addition of $1.0\nbillion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to\nthe allowance for credit losses was largely driven by\nchanges in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook,\nincluding the qualitative adjustment to reflect\nadditional weight placed on the adverse scenarios due\nto elevated risks and uncertainties related to the\ngeopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The net\naddition to the allowance for credit losses included:\n$562 million in wholesale , which also reflected\nchanges in credit quality on client-specific exposures\nand the impact of new lending-related commitments, and\n$441 million in consumer , predominantly driven by\nCard Services. The Firm's allowance for credit losses\nis estimated using a weighted average of five\ninternally developed macroeconomic scenarios. The\nadverse scenarios incorporate more punitive\nmacroeconomic factors than the central case\nassumptions provided in the following table, resulting\nin: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate\npeaking at 5.8% in the first quarter of 2026, and • a\nweighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.6%\nlower than the central case at the end of the second\nquarter of 2026.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s central case\nassumptions for the periods presented:\nCentral case assumptions\nat March 31, 2025\n2Q25       4Q25       2Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.3  %     4.3  %     4.3  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.5  %     2.2  %     2.0  %\nCentral case assumptions\nat December 31, 2024\n2Q25       4Q25       2Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.5  %     4.3  %     4.3  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.0  %     1.9  %     1.8  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate. (b) The year over year growth in\nU.S. real GDP in the forecast horizon of the central\nscenario is calculated as the percentage change in\nU.S. real GDP levels from the prior year. Subsequent\nchanges to this forecast and related estimates will be\nreflected in the provision for credit losses in future\nperiods. Refer to Note 13 and Note 10 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a description of\nthe policies, methodologies and judgments used to\ndetermine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses on\nloans, lending-related commitments, and investment\nsecurities.

Principal investments are predominantly\nprivately-held financial instruments and are managed\nin the LOBs and Corporate. Investments are typically\nintended to be held over extended periods and,\naccordingly, the Firm has no expectation for short-\nterm realized gains with respect to these investments.\nInvestment securities risk Investment securities risk\nincludes the exposure associated with a default in the\npayment of principal and interest. This risk is\nmitigated given that the investment securities\nportfolio held by Treasury and CIO predominantly\nconsists of high-quality securities. At March 31,\n2025, the Treasury and CIO investment securities\nportfolio, net of the allowance for credit losses, was\n$661.4 billion, and the average credit rating of the\nsecurities comprising the portfolio was AA+ (based\nupon external ratings where available, and where not\navailable, based primarily upon internal risk\nratings). Refer to Corporate results on pages 30-31\nand Note 9 for further information on the investment\nsecurities portfolio and internal risk ratings. Refer\nto Liquidity Risk Management on pages 40-46 for\nfurther information on related liquidity risk. Refer\nto Market Risk Management on pages 65-70 for further\ninformation on the market risk inherent in the\nportfolio.\nPrincipal investment risk Principal investments are\ntypically privately-held financial instruments\nrepresenting ownership interests or other forms of\njunior capital. In general, principal investments\ninclude tax-oriented investments and investments made\nto enhance or accelerate the Firm’s business\nstrategies and exclude those that are consolidated on\nthe Firm's balance sheets. These investments are made\nby dedicated investing businesses or as part of a\nbroader business strategy.

Refer to Market Risk Management on pages\n141–149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a\ndiscussion of the Firm’s Market Risk Management\norganization, market risk measurement, risk monitoring\nand control, and predominant business activities that\ngive rise to market risk.\nModels used to measure market risk are inherently\nimprecise and are limited in their ability to measure\ncertain risks or to predict losses. This imprecision\nmay be heightened when sudden or severe shifts in\nmarket conditions occur. For additional discussion on\nmodel uncertainty refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form\n10-K.\nMarket Risk Management periodically reviews the Firm’s\nexisting market risk measures to identify\nopportunities for enhancement, and to the extent\nappropriate, will calibrate those measures accordingly\nover time.\nValue-at-risk\nJPMorganChase utilizes value-at-risk (“VaR”), a\nstatistical risk measure, to estimate the potential\nloss from adverse market moves in the current market\nenvironment. The Firm has a single VaR framework used\nas a basis for calculating Risk Management VaR and\nRegulatory VaR.\nThe Firm’s Risk Management VaR is calculated assuming\na one-day holding period and an expected tail-loss\nmethodology which approximates a 95% confidence level.\nFor risk management purposes, the Firm believes this\nmethodology provides a daily measure of risk that is\nclosely aligned to risk management decisions made by\nthe LOBs and Corporate and, along with other market\nrisk measures, provides the appropriate information\nneeded to respond to risk events. The Firm calculates\nseparately a daily aggregated VaR in accordance with\nregulatory rules (“Regulatory VaR”), which is used to\nderive the Firm’s regulatory VaR-based capital\nrequirements under Basel III.\nThe Firm’s VaR model calculations are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s portfolios, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s modeling\ntechniques and measurements, and other factors. Such\nchanges may affect historical comparisons of VaR\nresults. Refer to Estimations and Model Risk\nManagement on page 160 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form\n10-K for information regarding model reviews and\napprovals.\nRefer to page 143 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K\nfor further information regarding VaR, including its\ninherent limitations, and the key differences between\nRisk Management VaR and Regulatory VaR.

This reflects the non-additive nature of VaR due to imperfect correlation across LOBs, Corporate, and\nrisk types. For maximum and minimum VaR, diversification benefit is not meaningful as the maximum and minimum VaR\nfor each portfolio may have occurred on different trading days than the components.\n(b) Includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and credit protection purchased against certain retained loans\nand lending-related commitments, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include\nthe retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.\n(c) Includes credit protection purchased against certain retained loans and lending-related commitments. This VaR\ndoes not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.\n(d) Includes a legacy private equity position which is publicly traded.\n(e) In the first quarter of 2025, the elevated average and maximum VaR was due to a client-driven equity position\nthat has since matured.\nQuarter over quarter results\nAverage total VaR for the three months ended March 31,\n2025 increased by $10 million, when compared with\nDecember 31, 2024, due to a client-driven equity\nposition that has since matured and increases in\ncommodities, both amid a volatile market. This was\npartially offset by market volatility rolling out of\nthe one-year historical look-back period impacting the\nForeign exchange risk type.\nYear over year results\nAverage total VaR for the three months ended March 31,\n2025 increased by $2 million compared with the same\nperiod in the prior year due to a client-driven equity\nposition that has since matured and increases in\ncommodities, both amid a volatile market. This was\npartially offset by market volatility rolling out of\nthe one-year historical look-back period impacting the\nForeign exchange risk type.\nThe following graph presents daily Risk Management VaR\nfor the five trailing quarters. The movements in the\nsecond quarter of 2024 were primarily driven by\nchanges in Visa Class C common share exposure in the\nFirm's Corporate VaR and the movements in the first\nquarter of 2025 were due to a client-driven equity\nposition that has since matured.\nDaily Risk Management VaR\nFirst Quarter    Second Quarter    Third Quarter    Fourth Quarter    First Quarter\n2024             2024              2024             2024              2025\n66\nVaR backtesting\nThe Firm performs daily VaR model backtesting, which compares the daily Risk Management VaR results with the daily\ngains and losses that are utilized for VaR backtesting purposes. The gains and losses depicted in the chart below\ndo not reflect the Firm’s reported revenue as they exclude certain components of total net revenue, such as those\nassociated with the execution of new transactions (i.e., intraday client-driven trading and intraday risk\nmanagement activities), fees, commissions, other valuation adjustments and net interest income. These excluded\ncomponents of total net revenue may more than offset the backtesting gain or loss on a particular day. The\ndefinition of backtesting gains and losses above is consistent with the requirements for backtesting under Basel\nIII capital rules.\nA backtesting exception occurs when the daily backtesting loss exceeds the daily Risk Management VaR for the prior\nday. Under the Firm’s Risk Management VaR methodology, assuming current changes in market values are consistent\nwith the historical changes used in the simulation, the Firm would expect to incur VaR backtesting exceptions five\ntimes every 100 trading days on average. The number of VaR backtesting exceptions observed can differ from the\nstatistically expected number of backtesting exceptions if the current level of market volatility is materially\ndifferent from the level of market volatility during the 12 months of historical data used in the VaR calculation.\nFor the 12 months ended March 31, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 172 of the 259 days, and observed 11\nVaR backtesting exceptions. For the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Firm posted backtesting gains on 42 of\nthe 63 days, and observed three VaR backtesting exceptions.\nThe following chart presents the distribution of Firmwide daily backtesting gains and losses for the trailing 12\nmonths and three months ended March 31, 2025. The daily backtesting losses are displayed as a percentage of the\ncorresponding daily Risk Management VaR. The count of days with backtesting losses are shown in aggregate, in fifty\npercentage point intervals. Backtesting exceptions are displayed within the intervals that are greater than one\nhundred percent. The results in the chart below differ from the results of backtesting disclosed in the Market Risk\nsection of the Firm’s Basel III Pillar 3 Regulatory Capital Disclosures reports, which are based on Regulatory VaR\napplied to the Firm’s covered positions.\nDistribution of Daily Backtesting Gains and Losses\n67\nStructural interest rate risk management\nThe effect of interest rate exposure on the Firm’s\nreported net income is important as interest rate risk\nrepresents one of the Firm’s significant market risks.\nInterest rate risk arises not only from trading\nactivities which are included in VaR, but also from\nthe Firm’s traditional banking activities, which\ninclude extension of loans and credit facilities,\ntaking deposits, issuing debt, as well as the\ninvestment securities portfolio, and associated\nderivative instruments.\nRefer to the table on page 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024\nForm 10-K for a summary by LOB and Corporate\nidentifying positions included in earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk\nOne way that the Firm evaluates its structural\ninterest rate risk is through earnings-at-risk.\nEarnings-at-risk estimates the Firm’s interest rate\nexposure for a given interest rate scenario. It is\npresented as a sensitivity to a baseline, which\nincludes net interest income and certain interest rate\nsensitive fees. The baseline uses market interest\nrates and, in the case of deposits, pricing\nassumptions. The Firm conducts simulations of changes\nto this baseline for interest rate-sensitive assets\nand liabilities denominated in U.S. dollars and other\ncurrencies (“non-U.S. dollar” currencies). These\nsimulations primarily include retained and held-for-\nsale loans, deposits, deposits with banks and\nfinancing activities, investment securities, long-term\ndebt, related interest rate hedges, and funds transfer\npricing of other positions in risk management VaR and\nother sensitivity-based measures as described on page\n142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K. These\nsimulations also include hedges of non-U.S. dollar\nforeign exchange exposures arising from capital\ninvestments. Refer to non-U.S. dollar foreign exchange\nrisk on page 149 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\nmore information.\nEarnings-at-risk scenarios estimate the potential\nchange to a baseline, over the following 12 months\nutilizing multiple assumptions. These scenarios\ninclude a parallel shift involving changes to both\nshort-term and long-term rates by an equal amount; a\nsteeper yield curve involving holding short-term rates\nconstant and increasing long-term rates; and a flatter\nyield curve involving increasing short-term rates and\nholding long-term rates constant or holding short-term\nrates constant and decreasing long-term rates. These\nscenarios consider many different factors, including:\nThe impact on exposures as a result of instantaneous\nchanges in interest rates from baseline rates.\nForecasted balance sheet, as well as modeled\nprepayment and reinvestment behavior, but excluding\nassumptions about actions that could be taken by the\nFirm or its clients and customers in response to\ninstantaneous rate changes. Mortgage prepayment\nassumptions are based on the interest rates used in\nthe scenarios compared with underlying contractual\nrates, the time since origination, and other factors\nwhich are updated periodically based on historical\nexperience. Deposit forecasts are a key assumption in\nthe Firm’s earnings-at-risk. The baseline reflects\ncertain assumptions relating to the Federal Reserve’s\nbalance sheet policy (e.g., quantitative tightening\nand usage at the Reverse Repurchase Facility) that\nrequire management judgment. The amount of deposits\nthat the Firm holds at any given time may be\ninfluenced by Federal Reserve actions, as well as\nbroader monetary conditions and competition for\ndeposits.\nThe pricing sensitivity of deposits, known as\ndeposit betas, represent the amount by which deposit\nrates paid could change upon a given change in market\ninterest rates. Actual deposit rates paid may differ\nfrom the modeled assumptions, primarily due to\ncustomer behavior and competition for deposits.\nThe Firm performs sensitivity analyses of the\nassumptions used in earnings-at-risk scenarios,\nincluding with respect to deposit betas and forecasts\nof deposit balances, both of which are especially\nsignificant in the case of consumer deposits. The\nresults of these sensitivity analyses are reported to\nthe CTC Risk Committee and the Board Risk Committee.\nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk scenarios are periodically\nevaluated and enhanced in response to changes in the\ncomposition of the Firm’s balance sheet, changes in\nmarket conditions, improvements in the Firm’s\nsimulation and other factors.\nThe Firm’s earnings-at-risk sensitivities are measures\nof the Firm’s interest rate exposure. The Firm’s\nactual net interest income for the rate changes\npresented may differ as the earnings-at-risk scenarios\nare modelled as instantaneous changes and exclude any\nactions that could be taken by the Firm or its clients\nor customers in response to rate changes. Other\nsignificant assumptions in the earnings-at-risk\nscenarios, including mortgage prepayments and deposit\nrates paid, may also differ from actual results. The\nFirm’s forecast for net interest income is included in\nthe Firm’s outlook on page 8.\n68\nThe Firm’s sensitivities are presented in the table\nbelow.\nDecember 31,\n(In billions)                            March 31, 2025(a)            2024(a)\nParallel shift:\n+100 bps shift in rates               $                2.2    $           2.3\n-100 bps shift in rates                               -2.2               -2.5\n+200 bps shift in rates                                4.3                4.6\n-200 bps shift in rates                               -4.8               -4.9\nSteeper yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in long-term rates                      1.1                1.0\n-100 bps shift in short-term rates                    -1.1               -1.4\nFlatter yield curve:\n+100 bps shift in short-term rates                     1.0                1.2\n-100 bps shift in long-term rates                     -1.1               -1.1\n(a) Reflects the simultaneous shift of U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar rates, including hedges of non-U.S. dollar\ncapital investments. Non-U.S. dollar sensitivities were insignificant. The change in the Firm’s sensitivities as of\nMarch 31, 2025 compared to December 31, 2024, were primarily driven by the net impact of Treasury and CIO actions,\npartially offset by the impact of changes in Firmwide deposits and loans, primarily in balances. Treasury and CIO\nactions consisted of an increase in cash flow hedges of floating rate retained loans which added duration,\npartially offset by securities activity.\nEconomic value sensitivity In addition to earnings-at-risk, which is measured as a sensitivity to a baseline of\nearnings over the next 12 months, the Firm also measures economic value sensitivity (“EVS”). EVS stress tests the\nlonger-term economic value of equity by measuring the sensitivity of the Firm’s current balance sheet, primarily\nretained loans, deposits, debt and investment securities as well as related hedges, under various interest rate\nscenarios. The Firm's pricing and cash flow assumptions associated with deposits, as well as prepayment assumptions\nfor loans and securities, are significant factors in the EVS measure. In accordance with the CTC interest rate risk\nmanagement policy, the Firm has established limits on EVS as a percentage of TCE. Certain assumptions used in the\nEVS measure may differ from those required in the fair value measurement note to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements. For example, certain assets and liabilities with no stated maturity, such as credit card receivables\nand deposits, have longer assumed durations in the EVS measure. Additional information on long-term debt and held\nto maturity investment securities is disclosed on page 95 in Note 2.\n69\nOther sensitivity-based measures\nThe Firm quantifies the market risk of certain debt and equity and credit and funding-related exposures by\nassessing the potential impact on net revenue, other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and noninterest expense due to\nchanges in relevant market variables. Refer to the predominant business activities that give rise to market risk on\npage 142 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on the positions captured in other\nsensitivity-based measures.\nThe table below represents the potential impact to net revenue, OCI or noninterest expense for market risk-\nsensitive instruments that are not included in VaR or earnings-at-risk.

The Country Risk Management group actively monitors the various portfolios\nwhich may be impacted by these developments and measures the extent to which the Firm’s exposures are diversified\ngiven the Firm’s strategy and risk tolerance relative to a country. Refer to pages 150–151 of JPMorganChase’s 2024\nForm 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s country risk management. Risk Reporting The following table\npresents the Firm’s top 20 exposures by country (excluding the U.S.) as of March 31, 2025 and their comparative\nexposures as of December 31, 2024. The top 20 country exposures represent the Firm’s largest total exposures by\nindividual country. Country exposures may fluctuate from period to period due to a variety of factors, including\nclient activity, market flows and liquidity management activities undertaken by the Firm. The decrease in exposure\nto Japan when compared to December 31, 2024 was predominantly driven by a reduction in cash placed with the central\nbank of Japan as a result of client-driven market-making activities. The Firm continues to monitor its exposure to\nRussia, which corresponds to cash placed with the central bank, but which excludes deposits placed on behalf of\nclients at the Deposit Insurance Agency of Russia. The Firm currently believes that its remaining exposure to\nRussia is not material.

The Firm’s most complex accounting estimates\nrequire management’s judgment to ascertain the\nappropriate carrying value of assets and liabilities.\nThe Firm has established policies and control\nprocedures intended to ensure that estimation methods,\nincluding any judgments made as part of such methods,\nare well-controlled, independently reviewed and\napplied consistently from period to period. The\nmethods used and judgments made reflect, among other\nfactors, the nature of the assets or liabilities and\nthe related business and risk management strategies,\nwhich may vary across the Firm’s businesses and\nportfolios. In addition, the policies and procedures\nare intended to ensure that the process for changing\nmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. The\nFirm believes its estimates for determining the\ncarrying value of its assets and liabilities are\nappropriate. The following is a brief description of\nthe Firm’s critical accounting estimates involving\nsignificant judgments.\nAllowance for credit losses\nThe Firm’s allowance for credit losses represents\nmanagement’s estimate of expected credit losses over\nthe remaining expected life of the Firm’s financial\nassets measured at amortized cost and certain off-\nbalance sheet lending-related commitments. The\nallowance for credit losses generally comprises:\nThe allowance for loan losses, which covers the\nFirm’s retained loan portfolios (scored and risk-\nrated),\nThe allowance for lending-related commitments, and\nThe allowance for credit losses on investment\nsecurities.\nThe allowance for credit losses involves significant\njudgment on a number of matters including development\nand weighting of macroeconomic forecasts,\nincorporation of historical loss experience,\nassessment of risk characteristics, assignment of risk\nratings, valuation of collateral, and the\ndetermination of remaining expected life. Refer to\nNote 10 and Note 13 of JPMorganChase's 2024 Form 10-K\nfor further information on these judgments as well as\nthe Firm’s policies and methodologies used to\ndetermine the Firm’s allowance for credit losses, and\nAllowance for credit losses on pages 61-63 and Note 12\nof this Form 10-Q for further information.\nOne of the most significant judgments involved in\nestimating the Firm’s allowance for credit losses\nrelates to the macroeconomic forecasts used to\nestimate credit losses over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod within the Firm’s methodology. The eight-\nquarter forecast incorporates hundreds of\nmacroeconomic variables (\"MEVs\") that are relevant for\nexposures across the Firm, with modeled credit losses\nbeing driven primarily by a subset of less than twenty\nvariables. The specific variables that have the\ngreatest effect on the modeled losses vary by\nportfolio and geography.\nKey MEVs for the consumer portfolio include regional\nU.S. unemployment rates and U.S. HPI.\nKey MEVs for the wholesale portfolio include U.S.\nunemployment, U.S. real GDP, U.S. equity prices, U.S.\ninterest rates, U.S. corporate credit spreads, oil\nprices, U.S. commercial real estate prices and U.S.\nHPI.\nChanges in the Firm’s assumptions and forecasts of\neconomic conditions could significantly affect its\nestimate of expected credit losses in the portfolio at\nthe balance sheet date or lead to significant changes\nin the estimate from one reporting period to the next.\nIt is difficult to estimate how potential changes in\nany one factor or input might affect the overall\nallowance for credit losses because management\nconsiders a wide variety of factors and inputs in\nestimating the allowance for credit losses. Changes in\nthe factors and inputs considered may not occur at the\nsame rate and may not be consistent across all\ngeographies or product types, and changes in factors\nand inputs may be directionally inconsistent, such\nthat improvement in one factor or input may offset\ndeterioration in others.\nTo consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate\nmacroeconomic forecast, the Firm compared the modeled\ncredit losses determined using its central and\nrelative adverse macroeconomic scenarios, which are\ntwo of the five scenarios considered in estimating the\nallowances for loan losses and lending-related\ncommitments. The central and relative adverse\nscenarios each included a full suite of MEVs, but\ndiffered in the levels, paths and peaks/troughs of\nthose variables over the eight-quarter forecast\nperiod.\nFor example, compared to the Firm’s central scenario\nshown on page 61 and in Note 12, the Firm’s relative\nadverse scenario assumes an elevated U.S. unemployment\nrate, averaging approximately 2.1% higher over the\neight-quarter forecast, with a peak difference of\napproximately 2.9% in the first quarter of 2026.\nThis analysis is not intended to estimate expected\nfuture changes in the allowance for credit losses, for\na number of reasons, including:\nThe allowance as of March 31, 2025, reflects credit\nlosses beyond those estimated under the central\nscenario due to the weight placed on the adverse\nscenarios.\n72\nThe impacts of changes in many MEVs are both\ninterrelated and nonlinear, so the results of this\nanalysis cannot be simply extrapolated for more severe\nchanges in macroeconomic variables. • Expectations of\nfuture changes in portfolio composition and borrower\nbehavior can significantly affect the allowance for\ncredit losses. To demonstrate the sensitivity of\ncredit loss estimates to macroeconomic forecasts as of\nMarch 31, 2025, the Firm compared the modeled\nestimates under its relative adverse scenario to its\ncentral scenario. Without considering offsetting or\ncorrelated effects in other qualitative components of\nthe Firm’s allowance for credit losses, the comparison\nbetween these two scenarios for the exposures below\nreflect the following differences: • An increase of\napproximately $1.0 billion for residential real estate\nloans and lending-related commitments • An increase of\napproximately $3.7 billion for credit card loans • An\nincrease of approximately $4.6 billion for wholesale\nloans and lending-related commitments This analysis\nrelates only to the modeled credit loss estimates and\nis not intended to estimate changes in the overall\nallowance for credit losses as it does not reflect any\npotential changes in other adjustments to the\nquantitative calculation, which would also be\ninfluenced by the judgment management applies to the\nmodeled lifetime loss estimates to reflect the\nuncertainty and imprecision of these modeled lifetime\nloss estimates based on then-current circumstances and\nconditions. Recognizing that forecasts of\nmacroeconomic conditions are inherently uncertain, the\nFirm believes that its process to consider the\navailable information and associated risks and\nuncertainties is appropriately governed and that its\nestimates of expected credit losses were reasonable\nand appropriate for the period ended March 31, 2025.\nFair value JPMorganChase carries a portion of its\nassets and liabilities at fair value. The majority of\nsuch assets and liabilities are measured at fair value\non a recurring basis, including trading assets and\nliabilities, AFS securities, structured note products\nand certain securities financing agreements. Certain\nassets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a\nnonrecurring basis, including certain mortgage, home\nequity and other loans, where the carrying value is\nbased on the fair value of the underlying collateral.\nAssets measured at fair value The following table\nincludes the Firm’s assets measured at fair value and\nthe portion of such assets that are classified within\nlevel 3 of the fair value hierarchy.

The level 3 balances would\nbe reduced if netting were applied, including the\nnetting benefit associated with cash collateral.\n73\nValuation\nDetails of the Firm’s processes for determining fair\nvalue are set out in Note 2. Estimating fair value\nrequires the application of judgment. The type and\nlevel of judgment required is largely dependent on the\namount of observable market information available to\nthe Firm. For instruments valued using internally\ndeveloped valuation models and other valuation\ntechniques that use significant unobservable inputs\nand are therefore classified within level 3 of the\nfair value hierarchy, judgments used to estimate fair\nvalue are more significant than those required when\nestimating the fair value of instruments classified\nwithin levels 1 and 2.\nIn arriving at an estimate of fair value for an\ninstrument within level 3, management must first\ndetermine the appropriate valuation model or other\nvaluation technique to use. Second, the lack of\nobservability of certain significant inputs requires\nmanagement to assess relevant empirical data in\nderiving valuation inputs including, for example,\ntransaction details, yield curves, interest rates,\nprepayment speeds, default rates, volatilities,\ncorrelations, prices (such as commodity, equity or\ndebt prices), valuations of comparable instruments,\nforeign exchange rates and credit curves. Refer to\nNote 2 for a further discussion of the valuation of\nlevel 3 instruments, including unobservable inputs\nused.\nFor instruments classified in levels 2 and 3,\nmanagement judgment must be applied to assess the\nappropriate level of valuation adjustments to reflect\ncounterparty credit quality, the Firm’s\ncreditworthiness, market funding rates, liquidity\nconsiderations, unobservable parameters, and for\nportfolios that meet specified criteria, the size of\nthe net open risk position. The judgments made are\ntypically affected by the type of product and its\nspecific contractual terms, and the level of liquidity\nfor the product or within the market as a whole. In\nperiods of heightened market volatility and\nuncertainty judgments are further affected by the\nwider variation of reasonable valuation estimates,\nparticularly for positions that are less liquid. Refer\nto Note 2 for a further discussion of valuation\nadjustments applied by the Firm.\nImprecision in estimating unobservable market inputs\nor other factors can affect the amount of gain or loss\nrecorded for a particular position.

(“JPMorganChase” or the “Firm”),\na financial holding company incorporated under\nDelaware law in 1968, is a leading financial services\nfirm based in the U.S., with operations worldwide. The\nFirm is a leader in investment banking, financial\nservices for consumers and small businesses,\ncommercial banking, financial transaction processing\nand asset management. Refer to Note 25 for further\ndiscussion of the Firm's reportable business segments.\nThe accounting and financial reporting policies of\nJPMorganChase and its subsidiaries conform to U.S.\nGAAP. Additionally, where applicable, the policies\nconform to the accounting and reporting guidelines\nprescribed by regulatory authorities. The preparation\nof the unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements\nrequires management to make estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the reported amounts of assets,\nliabilities, revenue and expense, and disclosures of\ncontingent assets and liabilities. Actual results\ncould be different from these estimates. In the\nopinion of management, all normal, recurring\nadjustments have been included such that this interim\nfinancial information is fairly stated. These\nunaudited Consolidated Financial Statements should be\nread in conjunction with the audited Consolidated\nFinancial Statements and related notes thereto\nincluded in JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K.\nConsolidation The Consolidated Financial Statements\ninclude the accounts of JPMorganChase and other\nentities in which the Firm has a controlling financial\ninterest. All material intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated. Assets held for\nclients in an agency or fiduciary capacity by the Firm\nare not assets of JPMorganChase and are not included\non the Consolidated balance sheets. The Firm\ndetermines whether it has a controlling financial\ninterest in an entity by first evaluating whether the\nentity is a voting interest entity or a variable\ninterest entity. Refer to Notes 1 and 14 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further\ndescription of JPMorganChase’s accounting policies\nregarding consolidation.\nOffsetting assets and liabilities\nU.S. GAAP permits entities to present derivative\nreceivables and derivative payables with the same\ncounterparty and the related cash collateral\nreceivables and payables on a net basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets when a legally enforceable\nmaster netting agreement exists. U.S. GAAP also\npermits securities sold and purchased under repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowed or loaned under\nsecurities loan agreements to be presented net when\nspecified conditions are met, including the existence\nof a legally enforceable master netting agreement. The\nFirm has elected to net such balances where it has\ndetermined that the specified conditions are met.\nRefer to Note 1 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on offsetting assets and\nliabilities.\n83\nNote 2 – Fair value measurement\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\na discussion of the Firm’s valuation methodologies for\nassets, liabilities and

“Net\nrealizable value” is a term defined in U.S. GAAP as not exceeding fair value less costs to sell (“transaction\ncosts”). Transaction costs for the Firm’s physical commodities inventories are either not applicable or immaterial\nto the value of the inventory. Therefore, net realizable value approximates fair value for the Firm’s physical\ncommodities inventories. When fair value hedging has been applied (or when net realizable value is below cost), the\ncarrying value of physical commodities approximates fair value, because under fair value hedge accounting, the cost\nbasis is adjusted for changes in\n86\nfair value. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of the Firm’s hedge accounting relationships. To provide\nconsistent fair value disclosure information, all physical commodities inventories have been included in each\nperiod presented.\n(c) Balances reflect the reduction of securities owned (long positions) by the amount of identical securities sold\nbut not yet purchased (short positions).\n(d) Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as\na practical expedient are not required to be classified in the fair value hierarchy. At March 31, 2025 and December\n31, 2024, the fair values of these investments, which include certain hedge funds, private equity funds, real\nestate and other funds, were $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion, respectively, primarily reported in other assets.\n(e) As permitted under U.S. GAAP, the Firm has elected to net derivative receivables and derivative payables and\nthe related cash collateral received and paid when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists. The level\n3 balances would be reduced if netting were applied, including the netting benefit associated with cash collateral.\nLevel 3 valuations\nRefer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for further information on the Firm’s valuation process and a\ndetailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments. The following table\npresents the Firm’s primary level 3 financial instruments, the valuation techniques used to measure the fair value\nof those financial instruments, the significant unobservable inputs, the range of values for those inputs and the\nweighted or arithmetic averages of such inputs. While the determination to classify an instrument within level 3 is\nbased on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement, level 3 financial\ninstruments typically include observable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be\nvalidated to external sources) in addition to the unobservable components. The level 1 and/or level 2 inputs are\nnot included in the table. In addition, the Firm manages the risk of the observable components of level 3 financial\ninstruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within levels 1 or 2 of the fair value\nhierarchy. The range of values presented in the table is representative of the highest and lowest level input used\nto value the significant groups of instruments within a product/instrument classification. Where provided, the\nweighted averages of the input values presented in the table are calculated based on the fair value of the\ninstruments that the input is being used to value. In the Firm’s view, the input range, weighted and arithmetic\naverage values do not reflect the degree of input uncertainty or an assessment of the reasonableness of the Firm’s\nestimates and assumptions. Rather, they reflect the characteristics of the various instruments held by the Firm and\nthe relative distribution of instruments within the range of characteristics. For example, two option contracts may\nhave similar levels of market risk exposure and valuation uncertainty, but may have significantly different implied\nvolatility levels because the option contracts have different underlyings, tenors, or strike prices. The input\nrange and weighted and arithmetic average values will therefore vary from period-to-period and parameter-to-\nparameter based on the characteristics of the instruments held by the Firm at each balance sheet date.\n87\nLevel 3\ninputs(…\nMarch\n31, 2025\nFair    Principal                  Range of\nProduct…           value    valuation    Unobserv…        input

classification on the Consolidated balance sheets. Furthermore, the inputs presented for each valuation\ntechnique in the table are, in some cases, not applicable to every instrument valued using the technique as the\ncharacteristics of the instruments can differ.\n(b) Comprises U.S. GSE and government agency securities of $ 390million, nonagency securities of $ 5million and\nnon-trading loans of $ 451million.\n(c) Comprises nonagency securities of $ 15million, trading loans of $ 66million and non-trading loans of $\n1.3billion.\n(d) Comprises trading loans of $ 737million and non-trading loans of $ 605million.\n(e) Long-term debt, short-term borrowings and deposits include structured notes issued by the Firm that are\nfinancial instruments that typically contain embedded derivatives. The estimation of the fair value of structured\nnotes includes the derivative features embedded within the instrument. The significant unobservable inputs are\nbroadly consistent with those presented for derivative receivables.\n(f) Includes equity securities of $ 764million including $ 631million in Other assets, for which quoted prices are\nnot readily available and the fair value is generally based on internal valuation techniques such as EBITDA\nmultiples and comparable analysis. All other level 3 assets and liabilities are insignificant both individually and\nin aggregate.\n(g) Price is a significant unobservable input for certain instruments. When quoted market prices are not readily\navailable, reliance is generally placed on price-based internal valuation techniques. The price input is expressed\nassuming a par value of $ 100.\n(h) Forward equity price is expressed as a percentage of the current equity price.\n(i) Amounts represent weighted averages except for derivative related inputs where arithmetic averages are used.\n88\nChanges in and ranges of unobservable inputs Refer to Note 2 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of\nthe impact on fair value of changes in unobservable inputs and the relationships between unobservable inputs as\nwell as a description of attributes of the underlying instruments and external market factors that affect the range\nof inputs used in the valuation of the Firm’s positions. Changes in level 3 recurring fair value measurements The\nfollowing tables include a rollforward of the Consolidated balance sheets amounts (including changes in fair value)\nfor financial instruments classified by the Firm within level 3 of the fair value hierarchy for the three months\nended March 31, 2025 and 2024. When a determination is made to classify a financial instrument within level 3, the\ndetermination is based on the significance of the unobservable inputs to the overall fair value measurement.\nHowever, level 3 financial instruments typically include, in addition to the unobservable or level 3 components,\nobservable components (that is, components that are actively quoted and can be validated to external sources);\naccordingly, the gains and losses in the table below include changes in fair value due in part to observable\nfactors that are part of the valuation methodology. The Firm risk-manages the observable components of level 3\nfinancial instruments using securities and derivative positions that are classified within level 1 or 2 of the fair\nvalue hierarchy; as these level 1 and level 2 risk management instruments are not included below, the gains or\nlosses in the following tables do not reflect the effect of the Firm’s risk management activities related to such\nlevel 3 instruments.\n89\n…                                                                                       C…\n…

Such adjustments may include adjustments to reflect\nthe different rights and obligations of similar securities, and other adjustments that are consistent with the\nFirm’s valuation techniques for private equity direct investments.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of equity securities without readily determinable fair values held\nas of March 31, 2025 and 2024, that are measured under the measurement alternative and the related adjustments\nrecorded during the periods presented for those securities with observable price changes. These securities are\nincluded in the nonrecurring fair value tables when applicable price changes are observable.\nAs of or for the period ended, (in millions)       Three months ended\nOther assets                                                March 31,  2025              2024\nCarrying value(a)                               $               3,988          $  4,467\nUpward carrying value changes(b)                                   52                20\nDownward carrying value                                           -18               -59\nchanges/impairment(c)\n(a) The carrying value as of December 31, 2024 was $ 3.7billion. The period-end carrying values reflect cumulative\npurchases and sales in addition to upward and downward carrying value changes.\n(b) The cumulative upward carrying value changes between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2025 were $ 1.2billion.\n(c) The cumulative downward carrying value changes/impairment between January 1, 2018 and March 31, 2025 were $(\n1.5) billion.\nIncluded in other assets above is the Firm’s interest in approximately 18.6million Visa Class B-2 common shares\n(\"Visa B-2 shares\") and 37.2million Visa Class B-1 common shares (“Visa B-1 shares”) reflected in the Firm's\nprincipal investment portfolio as of March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\nThe Visa B-2 shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions and are convertible into Visa Class A common\nshares (“Visa A shares”) at a specified conversion rate upon final resolution of certain litigation matters\ninvolving Visa. The conversion rate of Visa B-2 shares to Visa A shares was 1.5342at March 31, 2025 and may be\nadjusted by Visa depending on developments related to the litigation matters. The outcome of those litigation\nmatters, and the effect that the resolution of those matters may have on the conversion rate, is unknown.\nAccordingly, as of March 31, 2025, there is significant uncertainty regarding when the transfer restrictions on\nVisa B-2 shares may be terminated and what the final conversion rate for the Visa B-2 shares will be. As a result\nof these considerations, as well as differences in voting rights, Visa B-2 shares are not considered to be similar\nto Visa A shares, and are held at their nominal carryover basis.\nSeparately, in connection with sales of Visa B shares prior to 2024, the Firm has entered into derivative\ninstruments with the purchasers of the shares under which the Firm retains the risk associated with changes in the\nconversion rate. As of March 31, 2025, the Firm held derivative instruments associated with 11.6million Visa B-2\nshares related to Visa B share sales prior to 2024, which are all subject to similar terms and conditions.

For certain loans, the fair value is measured based on the value of the underlying collateral.\nCarrying value of the loan takes into account the loan’s allowance for loan losses, which represents the loan’s\nexpected credit losses over its remaining expected life. The difference between the estimated fair value and\ncarrying value of a loan is generally attributable to changes in market interest rates, including credit spreads,\nmarket liquidity premiums and other factors that affect the fair value of a loan but do not affect its carrying\nvalue.\n(b) Excludes lending-related commitments disclosed in the table below.\nThe majority of the Firm’s lending-related commitments are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis on the\nConsolidated balance sheets.

Unlike principal-protected structured notes and long-term beneficial interests, for which the\nFirm is obligated to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, nonprincipal-protected structured notes and\nlong-term beneficial interests do not obligate the Firm to return a stated amount of principal at maturity, but for\nstructured notes to return an amount based on the performance of an underlying variable or derivative feature\nembedded in the note. However, investors are exposed to the credit risk of the Firm as issuer for both\nnonprincipal-protected and principal-protected notes.\n(e) Where the Firm issues principal-protected zero-coupon or discount notes, the balance reflects the contractual\nprincipal payment at maturity or, if applicable, the contractual principal payment at the Firm’s next call date.\nAt March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, the contractual amount of lending-related commitments for which the fair\nvalue option was elected was $ 12.3billion and $ 12.2billion, respectively, with a corresponding fair value of $\n3million and $ 50million, respectively.

Derivative receivables and payables, as well as the related cash\ncollateral from the same counterparty, have been netted on the Consolidated balance sheets where the Firm has\nobtained an appropriate legal opinion with respect to the master netting agreement. Where such a legal opinion has\nnot been either sought or obtained, amounts are not eligible for netting on the Consolidated balance sheets, and\nthose derivative receivables and payables are shown separately in the tables.\nIn addition to the cash collateral received and transferred that is presented on a net basis with derivative\nreceivables and payables, the Firm receives and transfers additional collateral (financial instruments and cash).\nThese amounts mitigate counterparty credit risk associated with the Firm’s derivative instruments, but are not\neligible for net presentation:\ncollateral that consists of liquid securities and other cash collateral held at third-party custodians, which are\nshown separately as “Collateral not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets” in the tables, up to the fair\nvalue exposure amount. For the purpose of this disclosure, the definition of liquid securities is consistent with\nthe definition of high quality liquid assets as defined in the LCR rule;\nthe amount of collateral held or transferred that exceeds the fair value exposure at the individual counterparty\nlevel, as of the date presented, which is excluded from the tables; and\ncollateral held or transferred that relates to derivative receivables or payables where an appropriate legal\nopinion has not been either sought or obtained with respect to the master netting agreement, which is excluded from\nthe tables.\n102\nMarch                                            December\n31, 2025                                            31, 2024\nAmounts

For cash flow hedges that have\nbeen terminated, the maximum length of time over which the derivative results recorded in AOCI will be recognized\nin earnings is approximately seven years, corresponding to the timing of the originally hedged forecasted cash\nflows. For open cash flow hedges, the maximum length of time over which forecasted transactions are hedged is\napproximately seven years. The Firm’s longer-dated forecasted transactions relate to core lending and borrowing\nactivities.\nNet investment hedge gains and losses\nThe following table presents hedging instruments, by contract type, that were used in net investment hedge\naccounting relationships, and the pre-tax gains/(losses) recorded on such instruments for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025 and 2024.\nGains/(losses)\nrecorded in\nincome(a)and\nother\ncomprehensive\nincome/(loss)\nThree months        2025                                             2024\nended March         Amounts                            Amounts       Amounts                            Amounts\n31,                 recorded in                    recorded in       recorded in                    recorded in\n(in millions)       income(b)                              OCI       income(b)                              OCI\nForeign\nexchange         $                     33    $          -2,134    $                     89    $           1,442\nderivatives\n(a) Certain components of hedging derivatives are permitted to be excluded from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness, such as forward points on foreign exchange forward contracts.

Average yield is computed using the effective yield of each security owned at the end of the period, weighted\nbased on the amortized cost of each security. The effective yield considers the contractual coupon, amortization of\npremiums and accretion of discounts, and the effect of related hedging derivatives, including closed portfolio\nhedges. Taxable-equivalent amounts are used where applicable. The effective yield excludes unscheduled principal\nprepayments; and accordingly, actual maturities of securities may differ from their contractual or expected\nmaturities as certain securities may be prepaid. However, for certain callable debt securities, the average yield\nis calculated to the earliest call date.\n(b) For purposes of this table, the amortized cost of available-for-sale securities excludes the allowance for\ncredit losses of $ 36million and the portfolio layer fair value hedge basis adjustments of $ 463million at March\n31, 2025. The amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities also excludes the allowance for credit losses of $\n82million at March 31, 2025.\n(c) Substantially all of the Firm’s U.S. residential MBS and collateralized mortgage obligations are due in 10years\nor more, based on contractual maturity. The estimated weighted-average life, which reflects anticipated future\nprepayments, is approximately eight yearsfor agency residential MBS, six yearsfor agency residential collateralized\nmortgage obligations, and five yearsfor nonagency residential collateralized mortgage obligations.\n120\nNote 10 – Securities financing activities\nRefer to Note 11 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a discussion of accounting policies relating to securities\nfinancing activities. Refer to Note 3 for further information regarding securities financing agreements for which\nthe fair value option has been elected. Refer to Note 23 for further information regarding assets pledged and\ncollateral received in securities financing agreements. The table below summarizes the gross and net amounts of the\nFirm’s securities financing agreements as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024. When the Firm has obtained an\nappropriate legal opinion with respect to a master netting agreement with a counterparty and where other relevant\nnetting criteria under U.S. GAAP are met, the Firm nets, on the Consolidated balance sheets, the balances\noutstanding under its securities financing agreements with the same counterparty. In addition, the Firm exchanges\nsecurities and/or cash collateral with its counterparty to reduce the economic exposure with the counterparty, but\nsuch collateral is not eligible for net Consolidated balance sheet presentation. Where the Firm has obtained an\nappropriate legal opinion with respect to the counterparty master netting agreement, such collateral, along with\nsecurities financing balances that do not meet all these relevant netting criteria under U.S. GAAP, is presented in\nthe table below as “Amounts not nettable on the Consolidated balance sheets,” and reduces the “Net amounts”\npresented. Where a legal opinion has not been either sought or obtained, the securities financing balances are\npresented gross in the “Net amounts” below.

These amounts have been excluded based upon the government\nguarantee.\n(c) Purchased loans are included in the year in which they were originated.\nApproximately 38% of the total revolving loans are senior lien loans; the remaining balance are junior lien loans.\nThe lien position the Firm holds is considered in the Firm’s allowance for credit losses. Revolving loans that have\nbeen converted to term loans have higher delinquency rates than those that are still within the revolving period.\nThat is primarily because the fully-amortizing payment that is generally required for those products is higher than\nthe minimum payment options available for revolving loans within the revolving period.\n126\nNonaccrual loans and other credit quality indicators\nThe following table provides information on nonaccrual and other credit quality indicators for retained residential\nreal estate loans.\n(in millions, except weighted-average\ndata)                                          March 31, 2025          December 31, 2024\nNonaccrual loans(a)(b)(c)(d)                $           3,092       $              2,984\nCurrent estimated LTV ratios(e)(f)(g)\nGreater than 125% and refreshed FICO\nscores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                $              61       $                 72\nLess than 660                                               3                          3\n101% to 125% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                              163                        161\nLess than 660                                               5                          5\n80% to 100% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                            3,819                      4,962\nLess than 660                                              55                         73\nLess than 80% and refreshed FICO scores:\nEqual to or greater than 660                          293,281                    294,797\nLess than 660                                           8,504                      8,534\nNo FICO/LTV available(h)                                  632                        906\nTotal retained loans                        $         306,523       $            309,513\nWeighted-average LTV ratio(e)(i)                           46  %                      47  %\nWeighted-average FICO(f)(i)                               774                        774\nGeographic region(h)(j)\nCalifornia                                  $         119,614       $            120,944\nNew York                                               46,478                     46,854\nFlorida                                                21,730                     21,820\nTexas                                                  14,402                     14,531\nMassachusetts                                          13,345                     13,511\nColorado                                               10,437                     10,465\nIllinois                                                9,624                      9,835\nWashington                                              9,304                      9,372\nNew Jersey                                              7,448                      7,554\nConnecticut                                             6,796                      6,854\nAll other                                              47,345                     47,773\nTotal retained loans                        $         306,523       $            309,513\n(a) I ncludes collateral-dependent residential real estate loans that are charged down to the fair value of the\nunderlying collateral less costs to sell.

At March 31, 2025,\napproximately 9% of Chapter 7 residential real estate loans were 30 days or more past due.\n(b) Mortgage loans insured by U.S. government agencies excluded from nonaccrual loans were not material at March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n(c) Generally, all consumer nonaccrual loans have an allowance. In accordance with regulatory guidance, certain\nnonaccrual loans that are considered collateral-dependent have been charged down to the lower of amortized cost or\nthe fair value of their underlying collateral less costs to sell. If the value of the underlying collateral\nimproves subsequent to charge down, the related allowance may be negative.\n(d) Interest income on nonaccrual loans recognized on a cash basis was $ 37million and $ 43million for the three\nmonths ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively.\n(e) Represents the aggregate unpaid principal balance of loans divided by the estimated current property value.\nCurrent property values are estimated, at a minimum, quarterly, based on home valuation models using nationally\nrecognized home price index valuation estimates incorporating actual data to the extent available and forecasted\ndata where actual data is not available. Current estimated combined LTV for junior lien home equity loans considers\nall available lien positions, as well as unused lines, related to the property.\n(f) Refreshed FICO scores represent each borrower’s most recent credit score, which is obtained by the Firm on at\nleast a quarterly basis.\n(g) Includes residential real estate loans, primarily held in LLCs in AWM that did not have a refreshed FICO score.\nThese loans have been included in a FICO band based on management’s estimation of the borrower’s credit quality.\n(h) Included U.S. government-guaranteed loans as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n(i) Excludes loans with no FICO and/or LTV data available.\n(j) The geographic regions presented in the table are ordered based on the magnitude of the corresponding loan\nbalances at March 31, 2025.\n127\nLoan modifications\nThe Firm grants certain modifications of residential\nreal estate loans to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty. The Firm's proprietary modification\nprograms as well as government programs, including\nU.S. GSE programs, that generally provide various\nmodifications to borrowers experiencing financial\ndifficulty including, but not limited to, interest\nrate reductions, term extensions, other-than-\ninsignificant payment deferral and principal\nforgiveness that would otherwise have been required\nunder the terms of the original agreement, are\nconsidered FDMs. Refer to Note 12 of JPMorganChase's\n2024 Form 10-K for further information. Financial\neffects of FDMs For the three months ended March 31,\n2025, retained residential real estate FDMs were $\n61million. The financial effects of the FDMs, which\nwere largely in the form of term extensions and\ninterest rate reductions, included extending the\nweighted-average life of the loans by 15years, and\nreducing the weighted-average contractual interest\nrate from 7.41% to 6.18% for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025. For the three months ended March 31,\n2024, retained residential real estate FDMs were $\n39million. The financial effects of the FDMs, which\nwere predominantly in the form of term extensions and\ninterest rate reductions, included extending the\nweighted-average life of the loans by 16years, and\nreducing the weighted-average contractual interest\nrate from 7.39% to 4.28% for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2024.

If the borrower does not\nmake the contractual payments when due under the modified payment terms, the credit card loan continues to age and\nwill be charged-off in accordance with the Firm's standard charge-off policy. In most cases, the Firm does not\nreinstate the borrower's line of credit.\nFinancial effects of FDMs\nThe following tables provide information on retained credit card FDMs.\nLoan modifications\nThree months ended\nMarch 31, 2025\n(in millions, except                                       % of loan modifications       Financial effect of\nratios)                         Amortized cost basis             to total retained       loan modifications\ncredit card loans\nTerm extension with a\nTerm extension and                                                                       reduction in the\ninterest rate             $                      376                          0.17  %    weighted average\nreduction(a)(b)                                                                          contractual interest\nrate from23.04%\nto3.53%\nReduced\nweighted-average\nOther(b)(c)                                           5                          —       contractual interest\nrate from20.95%\nto8.61%\nTotal                     $                      381\nLoan modifications\nThree months ended March\n31, 2024\n(in millions, except                                     % of loan modifications       Financial effect of loan\nratios)                          Amortized cost basis          to total retained       modifications\ncredit card loans\nTerm extension with a\nTerm extension and                                                                     reduction in the\ninterest rate             $                       259                       0.13  %    weighted average\nreduction(a)(b)                                                                        contractual interest\nrate from23.88% to3.30%\nTotal                     $                       259\n(a) Term extension includes credit card loans whose terms have been modified under long-term programs by placing\nthe customer's credit card account on a fixed payment plan.\n(b) The interest rates represent the weighted average at the time of modification.\n(c) Primarily interest rate reduction.\nPayment status of FDMs\nThe following table provides information on the payment status of retained credit card FDMs during the twelve\nmonths ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.\n(in millions)                                             Amortized cost basis\nTwelve months ended March 31,           2025     Twelve months ended March 31,  2024\nCurrent and less than 30 days past due        $                            915        $  626\nand still accruing\n30-89 days past due and still accruing                                      83            65\n90 or more days past due and still                                          47            43\naccruing\nTotal                                         $                          1,045        $  734\nDefaults of FDMs\nRetained credit card FDMs that defaulted during the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024 and were reported as\nFDMs in the twelve months prior to the default were not material.\nFor credit card loans modified as FDMs, payment default is deemed to have occurred when the borrower misses\ntwoconsecutive contractual payments.

$ 1.0trillion and $ 943.9billion, respectively, for the\ncredit card portfolio segment; and $ 26.3billion and $ 20.9billion, respectively, for the wholesale portfolio\nsegment, which were not subject to the allowance for lending-related commitments.\n140\nDiscussion of changes in the allowance The allowance for credit losses as of March 31, 2025 was $ 27.8billion,\nreflecting a net addition of $ 1.0billion from December 31, 2024. The net addition to the allowance for credit\nlosses was largely driven by changes in the weighted-average macroeconomic outlook, including the qualitative\nadjustment to reflect additional weight placed on the adverse scenarios due to elevated risks and uncertainties\nrelated to the geopolitical and macroeconomic environment. The net addition to the allowance for credit losses\nincluded: • $ 562million in wholesale , which also reflected changes in credit quality on client-specific exposures\nand the impact of new lending-related commitments, and • $ 441million in consumer , predominantly driven by Card\nServices. The Firm's allowance for credit losses is estimated using a weighted average of five internally developed\nmacroeconomic scenarios. The adverse scenarios incorporate more punitive macroeconomic factors than the central\ncase assumptions provided in the following table, resulting in: • a weighted average U.S. unemployment rate peaking\nat 5.8% in the first quarter of 2026, and • a weighted average U.S. real GDP level that is 2.6% lower than the\ncentral case at the end of the second quarter of 2026.\nThe following table presents the Firm’s central case\nassumptions for the periods presented:\nCentral case assumptions\nat March 31, 2025\n2Q25       4Q25       2Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.3  %     4.3  %     4.3  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.5  %     2.2  %     2.0  %\nCentral case assumptions\nat December 31, 2024\n2Q25       4Q25       2Q26\nU.S. unemployment rate(a)                              4.5  %     4.3  %     4.3  %\nYoY growth in U.S. real GDP(b)                         2.0  %     1.9  %     1.8  %\n(a) Reflects quarterly average of forecasted U.S.\nunemployment rate.\n(b) The year over year growth in U.S. real GDP in the\nforecast horizon of the central scenario is calculated\nas the percentage change in U.S. real GDP levels from\nthe prior year. Subsequent changes to this forecast\nand related estimates will be reflected in the\nprovision for credit losses in future periods.

The Firm\nconsiders a “Firm-sponsored” VIE to include any entity where: (1) JPMorganChase is the primary beneficiary of the\nstructure; (2) the VIE is used by JPMorganChase to securitize Firm assets; (3) the VIE issues financial instruments\nwith the JPMorganChase name; or (4) the entity is a JPMorganChase–administered asset-backed commercial paper\nconduit.\nLine of Business            Transaction Type                              Activity    Form 10-Q page references\nCredit card                          Securitization of\nCCB                         securitization trusts           originated credit card                          142\nreceivables\nServicing and\nMortgage securitization     securitization of both                         142–144\ntrusts                      originated and purchased\nresidential mortgages\nSecuritization of both\nMortgage and other            originated and purchased\nCIB                         securitization trusts                  residential and                      142–144\ncommercial mortgages, and\nother consumer loans\nAssisting clients in\naccessing the financial\nMulti-seller conduits       markets in a                                       144\ncost-efficient manner and\nstructuring transactions\nto meet investor needs\nMunicipal bond vehicles     Financing of municipal                             144\nbond investments\nIn addition, CIB also invests in and provides financing, lending-related services and other services to VIEs\nsponsored by third parties. Refer to pages 145–146 of this Note for more information on the VIEs sponsored by third\nparties.\nSignificant Firm-sponsored VIEs Credit card securitizations As a result of the Firm’s continuing involvement, the\nFirm is considered to be the primary beneficiary of its Firm-sponsored credit card securitization trust, the Chase\nIssuance Trust. Firm-sponsored mortgage and other securitization trusts The Firm securitizes (or has securitized)\noriginated and purchased residential mortgages, commercial mortgages and other consumer loans primarily in its CCB\nand CIB businesses. Depending on the particular transaction, as well as the respective business involved, the Firm\nmay act as the servicer of the loans and/or retain certain beneficial interests in the securitization trusts.\n142\nThe following tables present the total unpaid principal amount of assets held in Firm-sponsored private-label\nsecuritization entities, including those in which the Firm has continuing involvement, and those that are\nconsolidated by the Firm. Continuing involvement includes servicing the loans, holding senior interests or\nsubordinated interests (including amounts required to be held pursuant to credit risk retention rules), recourse or\nguarantee arrangements, and derivative contracts. In certain instances, the Firm’s only continuing involvement is\nservicing the loans. The Firm’s maximum loss exposure from retained and purchased interests is the carrying value\nof these interests.

The retained interests in prime\nresidential mortgages consisted of $ 3.1billion and $ 2.9billion of investment-grade retained interests at March\n31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively, and $ 276million and $ 216million of noninvestment-grade retained\ninterests at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, respectively.

The Firm held $ 3.2billion and $ 2.9billion of the\ncommercial paper issued by the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, which have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm’s investments reflect the Firm’s funding needs\nand capacity and were not driven by market illiquidity. Other than the amounts required to be held pursuant to\ncredit risk retention rules, the Firm is not obligated under any agreement to purchase the commercial paper issued\nby the Firm-administered multi-seller conduits. Deal-specific liquidity facilities, program-wide liquidity and\ncredit enhancement provided by the Firm have been eliminated in consolidation. The Firm or the Firm-administered\nmulti-seller conduits provide lending-related commitments to certain clients of the Firm-administered multi-seller\nconduits. The unfunded commitments were $ 12.5billion and $ 10.3billion at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024,\nrespectively, and are reported as off-balance sheet lending-related commitments in other unfunded commitments to\nextend credit. Refer to Note 22 for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. Municipal\nbond vehicles Municipal bond vehicles or tender option bond (“TOB”) trusts allow institutions to finance their\nmunicipal bond investments at short-term rates. TOB transactions are known as customer TOB trusts and non-customer\nTOB trusts. Customer TOB trusts are sponsored by a third party. The Firm serves as sponsor for all non-customer TOB\ntransactions.\n144\nConsolidated VIE assets and liabilities\nThe following table presents information on assets and liabilities related to VIEs consolidated by the Firm as of\nMarch 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nLia…\nM…                                                                        Ben…\n3…                                                                        int…\n2…       As…                                                              in\n(…       Tr…                                              Tot…            VIE                         To…\nm…       as…           Lo…                   Ot…          ass…            ass…          Oth…          li…\nV…\np…\nt…\nF…\nc…    $          —  $       12,…          $       165  $        12…    $        5,…  $         10  $       5,3…\nc…\nt…\nF…\nm…               —          18,…                  124           19…             15…            31          15,…\nc…\nM…\nb…            3,0…             —                   37           3,…             3,…            21          3,2…\nv…\nM…\ns…               —           613                    8           621             112            46           158\ne…\nO…             544          4,5…    -b            315           5,…              50           326           376\nT…    $       3,5…  $       36,…          $       649  $        40…    $        24…  $        434  $       25,…\nAs…                                                              Lia…\nD…                                                                        Ben…\n3…       Tr…                                              Tot…            int…                        To…\n2…       as…           Lo…                   Ot…          ass…            in            Oth…          li…\n(…                                                                        VIE\nm…                                                                        ass…\nV…\np…\nt…\nF…\nc…    $          —  $       13,…          $       168  $        13…    $        5,…  $         10  $       5,3…\nc…\nt…\nF…\nm…               1          20,…                  133           20…             18…            26          18,…\nc…\nM…\nb…            3,3…             —                   22           3,…             3,…            15          3,6…\nv…\nM…\ns…               —           630                    8           638             115            48           163\ne…\nO…             496          1,9…    -b            350           2,…              51           355           406\nT…    $       3,8…  $       36,…          $       681  $        41…    $        27…  $        454  $       27,…\n(a) Includes residential mortgage securitizations.\n(b) Primarily includes consumer loans in CIB.\n(c) Includes assets classified as cash and other assets on the Consolidated balance sheets.\n(d) The assets of the consolidated VIEs included in the program types above are used to settle the liabilities of\nthose entities. The assets and liabilities include third-party assets and liabilities of consolidated VIEs and\nexclude intercompany balances that eliminate in consolidation.\n(e) The interest-bearing beneficial interest liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are classified on the\nConsolidated balance sheets as “Beneficial interests issued by consolidated VIEs”. The holders of these beneficial\ninterests generally do not have recourse to the general credit of JPMorganChase. Included in beneficial interests\nin VIE assets are long-term beneficial interests of $ 5.5billion at both March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\n(f) Includes liabilities classified as accounts payable and other liabilities on the Consolidated balance sheets.\nVIEs sponsored by third parties The Firm enters into transactions with VIEs structured by other parties. These\ninclude, for example, acting as a derivative counterparty, liquidity provider, investor, underwriter, placement\nagent, remarketing agent, trustee or custodian. These transactions are conducted at arm’s-length, and individual\ncredit decisions are based on the analysis of the specific VIE, taking into consideration the quality of the\nunderlying assets. Where the Firm does not have the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most\nsignificantly impact the VIE’s economic performance, or a variable interest that could potentially be significant,\nthe Firm generally does not consolidate the VIE, but it records and reports these positions on its Consolidated\nbalance sheets in the same manner it would record and report positions in respect of any other third-party\ntransaction. Tax credit vehicles The Firm holds investments in unconsolidated tax credit vehicles, which are\nlimited partnerships and similar entities that own and operate affordable housing, alternative energy, and other\nprojects. These entities are primarily considered VIEs. A third party is typically the general partner or managing\nmember and has control over the significant activities of the tax credit vehicles, and accordingly the Firm does\nnot consolidate tax credit vehicles. The Firm generally invests in these partnerships as a limited partner and\nearns a return primarily through the receipt of tax credits allocated to the projects. The maximum loss exposure,\nrepresented by equity investments and funding commitments, was $ 34.3billion and $ 35.2billion at March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024, of which $ 13.9billion and $ 15.0billion was unfunded at March 31, 2025 and December 31,\n2024, respectively. The Firm assesses each project and to reduce the risk\n145\nof loss, may withhold varying amounts of its capital investment until the project qualifies for tax credits. Refer\nto Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for more information on off-balance sheet lending-related commitments. The Firm\nelected the proportional amortization method for certain tax-oriented investments on a program-by-program basis.\nThe proportional amortization method requires the cost of eligible investments, within an elected program, be\namortized in proportion to the tax benefits received with the resulting amortization reported directly in income\ntax expense, which aligns with the associated tax credits and other tax benefits. Investments must meet certain\ncriteria to be eligible, including that substantially all of the return is from income tax credits and other income\ntax benefits. In addition, under this method deferred taxes are generally not recorded as the investment is now\namortized in proportion to the income tax credits and other income tax benefits received. Delayed equity\ncontributions that are unconditional and legally binding or conditional and probable of occurring are recorded in\nother liabilities with a corresponding increase in the carrying value of the investment. The guidance also requires\na reevaluation of eligible investments when significant modifications or events occur that result in a change in\nthe nature of the investment or a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project. During the period,\nthere were no significant modifications or events that resulted in a change in the nature of an eligible investment\nor a change in the Firm's relationship with the underlying project.\nThe following table provides information on tax-\noriented investments for which the Firm elected to\napply the proportional amortization method.\n(in millions)\nThree months ended March 31,\nPrograms for which the Firm elected proportional             Alternative energy and affordable\namortization:                                       2025                      housing programs  2024\nCarrying value(a)                                         $                             31,540        $  29,821\nTax credits and other tax benefits(b)                                                    1,358            1,266\nInvestments that qualify to be accounted\nfor using proportional amortization:\nAmortization losses recognized as a                                                       -983           -1,016\ncomponent of income tax expense\nNon-income-tax-related gains/(losses)\nand other returns received that are                                                         31               48\nrecognized outside of income tax\nexpense(c)\n(a) Recorded in Other assets on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets.

In certain customer TOB transactions,\nthe Firm, as liquidity provider, has entered into a\nreimbursement agreement with the Residual holder. In\nthose transactions, upon the termination of the\nvehicle, the Firm has recourse to the third-party\nResidual holders for any shortfall. The Firm does not\nhave any intent to protect Residual holders from\npotential losses on any of the underlying municipal\nbonds. The Firm does not consolidate customer TOB\ntrusts, since the Firm does not have the power to make\ndecisions that significantly impact the economic\nperformance of the municipal bond vehicle. The Firm’s\nmaximum exposure as a liquidity provider to customer\nTOB trusts at March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024 was\n$ 6.2billion and $ 5.8billion, respectively. The fair\nvalue of assets held by such VIEs at March 31, 2025\nand December 31, 2024 was $ 8.5billion and $\n8.1billion, respectively.\n146\nLoan securitizations\nThe Firm has securitized and sold a variety of loans, including residential mortgages, credit card receivables,\ncommercial mortgages and other consumer loans.\nSecuritization activity\nThe following table provides information related to the Firm’s securitization activities for the three months ended\nMarch 31, 2025 and 2024, related to assets held in Firm-sponsored securitization entities that were not\nconsolidated by the Firm, and where sale accounting was achieved at the time of the securitization.\nThree months\nended March 31,\n2025                                            2024\nResidential          Commercial and             Residential         Commercial and\n(in millions)                mortgage(d)                other(e)             mortgage(d)               other(e)\nPrincipal           $              4,524    $              2,834    $              4,922    $             2,358\nsecuritized\nAll cash flows\nduring the\nperiod:(a)\nProceeds\nreceived from\nloan sales as       $              4,665    $              2,849    $              4,831    $             2,324\nfinancial\ninstruments(b)(…\nServicing fees                         8                      11                       6                      3\ncollected\nCash flows\nreceived on                          120                     279                      70                    130\ninterests\n(a) Excludes re-securitization transactions.\n(b) Primarily includes Level 2 assets.\n(c) The carrying value of the loans accounted for at fair value approximated the proceeds received upon loan sale.\n(d) Represents prime mortgages.

These loans and excess MSRs are sold primarily for\nthe purpose of securitization by the U.S. GSEs, who provide certain guarantee provisions (e.g., credit enhancement\nof the loans). The Firm also sells loans into securitization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae guidelines; these\nloans are typically insured or guaranteed by another U.S. government agency. The Firm does not consolidate the\nsecuritization vehicles underlying these transactions as it is not the primary beneficiary. For a limited number of\nloan sales, the Firm is obligated to share a portion of the credit risk associated with the sold loans with the\npurchaser. Refer to Note 22 of this Form 10-Q for additional information about the Firm’s loan sales- and\nsecuritization-related indemnifications and Note 14 for additional information about the impact of the Firm’s sale\nof certain excess MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes the activities related\nto loans sold to the U.S. GSEs, and loans in\nsecuritization transactions pursuant to Ginnie Mae\nguidelines.\nThree months ended\n(in millions)                                       March 31,  2025            2024\nCarrying value of loans sold            $               8,614        $  4,536\nProceeds received from loan sales as                      638             306\ncash\nProceeds from loan sales as                             7,893           4,192\nsecurities(a)(b)\nTotal proceeds received from loan       $               8,531        $  4,498\nsales(c)\nGains/(losses) on loan sales(d)(e)      $                   —        $      —\n(a) Includes securities from U.S. GSEs and Ginnie Mae\nthat are generally sold shortly after receipt or\nretained as part of the Firm’s investment securities\nportfolio.

The Firm typically elects to repurchase delinquent loans from Ginnie Mae loan\npools as it continues to service them and/or manage the foreclosure process in accordance with the applicable\nrequirements, and such loans continue to be insured or guaranteed. When the Firm’s repurchase option becomes\nexercisable, such loans must be reported on the Consolidated balance sheets as a loan with a corresponding\nliability. Refer to Note 11 for additional information.\nThe following table presents loans the Firm\nrepurchased or had an option to repurchase, real\nestate owned, and foreclosed government-guaranteed\nresidential mortgage loans recognized on the Firm’s\nConsolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024.

Goodwill Goodwill is recorded\nupon completion of a business combination as the\ndifference between the purchase price and the fair\nvalue of the net assets acquired, and can be adjusted\nup to one year from the acquisition date as additional\ninformation pertaining to facts and circumstances that\nexisted as of the acquisition date is obtained about\nthe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed.\nThe following table presents goodwill attributed to\nthe reportable business segments and Corporate.\nMarch 31,             December 31,\n(in millions)                              2025                  2024\nConsumer & Community Banking    $  32,116             $  32,116\nCommercial & Investment Bank       11,240                11,236\nAsset & Wealth Management           8,552                 8,521\nCorporate                             713                   692\nTotal goodwill                  $  52,621             $  52,565\nThe following table presents changes in the carrying\namount of goodwill.\nThree months ended\n(in millions)                                  March 31,  2025             2024\nBalance at beginning of period     $              52,565        $  52,634\nChanges during the period from:\nBusiness combinations                                  —               34\nOther(a)                                              56              -32\nBalance at March 31,               $              52,621        $  52,636\n(a) Primarily foreign currency adjustments.\nGoodwill impairment testing Goodwill is tested for impairment during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or\nmore often if events or circumstances, such as adverse changes in the business climate, indicate that there may be\nan impairment. Refer to Note 15 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of the Firm’s goodwill\nimpairment testing. Unanticipated declines in business performance, increases in credit losses, increases in\ncapital requirements, as well as deterioration in economic or market conditions, adverse regulatory or legislative\nchanges or increases in the estimated market cost of equity, could cause the estimated fair values of the Firm’s\nreporting units to decline in the future, which could result in a material impairment charge to earnings in a\nfuture period related to some portion of the associated goodwill. As of March 31, 2025, the Firm reviewed current\neconomic conditions, estimated market cost of equity, as well as actual business results and projections of\nbusiness performance. Based on such reviews, the Firm has concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of March 31,\n2025 or December 31, 2024, nor was goodwill written off due to impairment during the three months ended March 31,\n2025 or 2024.\n149\nMortgage servicing rights\nMSRs represent the fair value of expected future cash flows for performing servicing activities for others. The\nfair value considers estimated future servicing fees and ancillary revenue, offset by estimated costs to service\nthe loans, and generally declines over time as net servicing cash flows are received, effectively amortizing the\nMSR asset against contractual servicing and ancillary fee income. MSRs are either purchased from third parties or\nrecognized upon sale or securitization of mortgage loans if servicing is retained. Refer to Notes 2 and 15 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further description of the MSR asset, interest rate risk management, and the\nvaluation of MSRs.\nThe following table summarizes MSR activity for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024.\n(in millions, except where otherwise           As of or for the three months\nnoted)                                                       ended March 31,  2025              2024\nFair value at beginning of period           $                          9,121          $  8,522\nMSR activity:\nOriginations of MSRs                                                     111                58\nPurchase of MSRs(a)                                                      279                 2\nDisposition of MSRs                                                        4                 5\nNet additions/(dispositions)                                             394                65\nChanges due to collection/realization of                                -261              -260\nexpected cash flows\nChanges in valuation due to inputs and\nassumptions:\nChanges due to market interest rates and                                -100               268\nother(b)\nChanges in valuation due to other inputs\nand assumptions:\nProjected cash flows (e.g., cost to                                        1                 7\nservice)\nDiscount rates                                                             —                 —\nPrepayment model changes and other(c)                                    -28                 3\nTotal changes in valuation due to other                                  -27                10\ninputs and assumptions\nTotal changes in valuation due to inputs                                -127               278\nand assumptions\nFair value at March 31,                     $                          9,127          $  8,605\nChanges in unrealized gains/(losses)\nincluded in income related to MSRs held     $                           -127          $    278\nat March 31,\nContractual service fees, late fees and                                  402               399\nother ancillary fees included in income\nThird-party mortgage loans serviced at                                   666               627\nMarch 31, (in billions)\nServicer advances, net of an allowance\nfor uncollectible amounts, at March                                      529               607\n31(d)\n(a) Includes purchase price adjustments associated with MSRs purchased in the prior quarter, primarily as a result\nof loans that prepaid within 90 days of settlement, allowing the Firm to recover the purchase price.\n(b) Represents both the impact of changes in estimated future prepayments due to changes in market interest rates,\nand the difference between actual and expected prepayments.\n(c) Represents changes in prepayments other than those attributable to changes in market interest rates.\n(d) Represents amounts the Firm pays as the servicer (e.g., scheduled principal and interest, taxes and insurance),\nwhich will generally be reimbursed within a short period of time after the advance from future cash flows from the\ntrust or the underlying loans.

The contractual amount of these financial instruments represents the\nmaximum possible credit risk to the Firm should the customer or client draw upon the commitment or the Firm be\nrequired to fulfill its obligation under the guarantee, and should the customer or client subsequently fail to\nperform according to the terms of the contract. Most of these commitments and guarantees have historically been\nrefinanced, extended, cancelled, or expired without being drawn or a default occurring. As a result, the total\ncontractual amount of these instruments is not, in the Firm’s view, representative of its expected future credit\nexposure or funding requirements. Refer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for a further discussion of\nlending-related commitments and guarantees, and the Firm’s related accounting policies. To provide for expected\ncredit losses in wholesale and certain consumer lending-related commitments, an allowance for credit losses on\nlending-related commitments is maintained. Refer to Note 12 for further information regarding the allowance for\ncredit losses on lending-related commitments. The following table summarizes the contractual amounts and carrying\nvalues of off-balance sheet lending-related financial instruments, guarantees and other commitments at March 31,\n2025 and December 31, 2024. The amounts in the table below for credit card, home equity and certain scored business\nbanking lending-related commitments represent the total available credit for these products. The Firm has not\nexperienced, and does not anticipate, that all available lines of credit for these commitments will be utilized at\nthe same time. The Firm can reduce or cancel these commitments, in accordance with the contract, or to the extent\notherwise permitted by law, including when there has been a demonstrable decline in the creditworthiness of the\nborrower or significant decrease in the value of underlying property.\n160\nOf…\nsh…\nle…\nfi…\nin…       Co…\ngu…       am…\nand       Ma…                                                       Dec                    Mar             Dec\not…       31,                                                       31,    Car…            31,             31,\nco…       20…                                                       20…    val…            2025            2024\nEx…       Exp…       Ex…\nBy         in       aft…       af…       Exp…\nre…         1          1         3       aft…\nma…       ye…       year       ye…          5       To…       Tot…\n(in        or       thr…       th…       yea…\nmi…       le…          3         5\nyea…       ye…\nLe…\nCo…\nex…\ncr…\nca…\nRe…\nRe…    $  12…    $  6,9…    $  4,…    $  7,3…    $  31…    $  30,…                 $  459          $  534\nEs…\nAu…\nand       11…          1         4       3,7…       14…       14,…                     17              37\not…\nTo…\nco…\nex…       23…       6,9…       4,…       11,…       46…       44,…                    476             571\ncr…\nca…\nCr…       1,…          —         —          —       1,…       1,0…                      —               —\nca…\nTo…       1,…       6,9…       4,…       11,…       1,…       1,0…                    476             571\nco…\nWh…\nOt…\nun…\nco…       11…       194…       18…       25,…       51…       498…                    2,…             2,…\nto\nex…\ncr…\nSt…\nle…\nof\ncr…       15…       8,6…       4,…        540       28…       28,…                    517             473\nand\not…\nfi…\ngu…\nOt…\nle…       4,…        252         7         81       4,…       4,3…                     37              37\nof\ncr…\nTo…       13…       203…       18…       26,…       54…       531…                    3,…             3,…\nwh…\nTo…    $  1,…    $  210…    $  19…    $  37,…    $  1,…    $  1,5…                 $  3,…          $  3,…\nle…\nOt…\ngu…\nand\nco…\nSe…\nle…\nin…    $  35…    $     —    $    —    $     —    $  35…    $  310…                 $    —          $    —\nag…\nand\ngu…\nDe…\nqu…       1,…        222       9,…       37,…       48…       49,…                     38             113\nas\ngu…\nUn…\nre…\nand       13…        607       1,…          —       13…       115…                      —               2\nse…\nbo…\nag…\nUn…\nre…\nand       11…        545         —          —       11…       66,…                      —              -2\nse…\nlo…\nag…\nLo…\nsa…\nand\nse…\nin…\nMo…\nre…        NA         NA        NA         NA        NA         NA                     45              45\nli…\nLo…\nso…        NA         NA        NA         NA       1,…       1,1…                     23              23\nwi…\nre…\nEx…\n&\ncl…\nho…       25…          —         —          —       25…       401…                      —               —\ngu…\nand\nco…\nOt…\ngu…       14…        454       377        803       15…       12,…                     23              28\nand\nco…\n(a) Includes certain commitments to purchase loans from correspondents.\n(b) Also includes commercial card lending-related commitments primarily in CIB.\n(c) Predominantly all consumer and wholesale lending-related commitments are in the U.S.\n(d) As of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024, reflected the contractual amount net of risk participations\ntotaling $ 147million and $ 85million, respectively, for other unfunded commitments to extend credit; $ 9.5billion\nat both periods for standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees; $ 526million and $ 556million,\nrespectively, for other letters of credit.

The Firm also issues commitments under multipurpose\nfacilities which could be drawn upon in several forms, including the issuance of a standby letter of credit.\nStandby letters of credit and other financial guarantees Standby letters of credit and other financial guarantees\nare conditional lending commitments issued by the Firm to guarantee the performance of a client or customer to a\nthird party under certain arrangements, such as commercial paper facilities, bond financings, acquisition\nfinancings, trade financings and similar transactions.\nThe following table summarizes the contractual amount and carrying value of standby letters of credit and other\nfinancial guarantees and other letters of credit arrangements as of March 31, 2025 and December 31, 2024.\nStandby letters of credit, other financial guarantees and other letters of credit\nMarch 31,                                         December 31,\n2025                                              2024\nStandby                                           Standby\nletters of                                        letters of                              Other\n(in             credit and                       Other letters    credit and                            letters\nmillions)       other                                of credit    other                               of credit\nfinancial                                         financial\nguarantees                                        guarantees\nInvestment-…                     $  20,093    $          3,695                     $  20,443    $         3,380\nNoninvestme…                         8,432               1,106                         8,233                974\nTotal\ncontractual                      $  28,525    $          4,801                     $  28,676    $         4,354\namount\nAllowance\nfor                              $     121    $             37                     $      94    $            37\nlending-rel…\ncommitments\nGuarantee                              396                   —                           379                  —\nliability\nTotal\ncarrying                         $     517    $             37                     $     473    $            37\nvalue\nCommitments\nwith                             $  16,723    $            381                     $  16,805    $           357\ncollateral\n(a) The ratings scale is based on the Firm’s internal risk ratings. Refer to Note 11 for further information on\ninternal risk ratings.\nDerivatives qualifying as guarantees The Firm\ntransacts in certain derivative contracts that have\nthe characteristics of a guarantee under U.S. GAAP.\nRefer to Note 28 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\nfurther information on these derivatives.\nThe following table summarizes the derivatives\nqualifying as guarantees as of March 31, 2025 and\nDecember 31, 2024.\n(in millions)                                      March 31, 2025               December 31, 2024\nNotional amounts\nDerivative guarantees                   $  48,671                    $  49,628\nStable value contracts with                34,988                       32,939\ncontractually limited exposure\nMaximum exposure of stable value\ncontracts with contractually limited        1,342                        1,740\nexposure\nFair value\nDerivative payables                            38                          113\nIn addition to derivative contracts that meet the characteristics of a guarantee, the Firm is both a purchaser and\nseller of credit protection in the credit derivatives market. Refer to Note 4 for a further discussion of credit\nderivatives.\nLoan sales- and securitization-related indemnifications In connection with the Firm’s mortgage loan sale and\nsecuritization activities with U.S. GSEs the Firm has made representations and warranties that the loans sold meet\ncertain requirements, and that may require the Firm to repurchase mortgage loans and/or indemnify the loan\npurchaser if such representations and warranties are breached by the Firm. The liability related to repurchase\ndemands associated with private label securitizations is separately evaluated by the Firm in establishing its\nlitigation reserves. Refer to Note 24 of this Form 10-Q and Note 30 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\nadditional information regarding litigation.\n162\nMerchant charge-backs Under the rules of payment\nnetworks, in its role as a merchant acquirer, the\nFirm's Merchant Services business in CIB Payments,\nretains a contingent liability for disputed processed\ncredit and debit card transactions that result in a\ncharge-back to the merchant. If a dispute is resolved\nin the cardholder’s favor, the Firm will (through the\ncardholder’s issuing bank) credit or refund the amount\nto the cardholder and will charge back the transaction\nto the merchant. If the Firm is unable to collect the\namount from the merchant, the Firm will bear the loss\nfor the amount credited or refunded to the cardholder.\nThe Firm mitigates this risk by withholding future\nsettlements, retaining cash reserve accounts or\nobtaining other collateral. In addition, the Firm\nrecognizes a valuation allowance that covers the\npayment or performance risk related to charge-backs.\nSponsored member repo program The Firm acts as a\nsponsoring member to clear eligible overnight and term\nresale and repurchase agreements through the\nGovernment Securities Division of the Fixed Income\nClearing Corporation (“FICC”) on behalf of clients\nthat become sponsored members under the FICC’s rules.\nThe Firm also guarantees to the FICC the prompt and\nfull payment and performance of its sponsored member\nclients’ respective obligations under the FICC’s\nrules. The Firm minimizes its liability under these\nguarantees by obtaining a security interest in the\ncash or high-quality securities collateral that the\nclients place with the clearing house; therefore, the\nFirm expects the risk of loss to be remote. The Firm’s\nmaximum possible exposure, without taking into\nconsideration the associated collateral, is included\nin the Exchange & clearing house guarantees and\ncommitments line on page 161. Refer to Note 11 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation on credit risk mitigation practices on\nresale agreements and the types of collateral pledged\nunder repurchase agreements. Guarantees of\nsubsidiaries The Parent Company has guaranteed certain\nlong-term debt and structured notes of its\nsubsidiaries, including JPMorgan Chase Financial\nCompany LLC (“JPMFC”), a 100%-owned finance\nsubsidiary. All securities issued by JPMFC are fully\nand unconditionally guaranteed by the Parent Company\nand no other subsidiary of the Parent Company\nguarantees these securities. These guarantees, which\nrank pari passu with the Firm’s unsecured and\nunsubordinated indebtedness, are not included in the\ntable on page 161 of this Note. Refer to Note 20 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional\ninformation.\nNote 23 – Pledged assets and collateral\nRefer to Note 29 of JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for\na discussion of the Firm’s pledged assets and\ncollateral.\nPledged assets\nThe Firm pledges financial assets that it owns to\nmaintain potential borrowing capacity at discount\nwindows with Federal Reserve banks, various other\ncentral banks and FHLBs. Additionally, the Firm\npledges assets for other purposes, including to\ncollateralize repurchase and other securities\nfinancing agreements, to cover short sales and to\ncollateralize derivative contracts and deposits.\nCertain of these pledged assets may be sold or\nrepledged or otherwise used by the secured parties and\nare parenthetically identified on the Consolidated\nbalance sheets as assets pledged.\nThe following table presents the carrying value of the\nFirm’s pledged assets.\n(in billions)                                           March 31, 2025                December 31, 2024\nAssets that may be sold or repledged or     $    242.1                    $    152.5\notherwise used by secured parties\nAssets that may not be sold or repledged         360.9                         297.9\nor otherwise used by secured parties\nAssets pledged at Federal Reserve banks          698.9                         724.0\nand FHLBs\nTotal pledged assets                        $  1,301.9                    $  1,174.4\nTotal pledged assets do not include assets of\nconsolidated VIEs; these assets are used to settle the\nliabilities of those entities. Refer to Note 13 for\nadditional information on assets and liabilities of\nconsolidated VIEs. Refer to Note 10 for additional\ninformation on the Firm’s securities financing\nactivities. Refer to Note 20 of JPMorganChase’s 2024\nForm 10-K for additional information on the Firm’s\nlong-term debt.\nCollateral\nThe Firm accepts financial assets as collateral that\nit is permitted to sell or repledge, deliver or\notherwise use. This collateral is generally obtained\nunder resale and other securities financing\nagreements, prime brokerage-related held-for-\ninvestment customer receivables and derivative\ncontracts. Collateral is generally used under\nrepurchase and other securities financing agreements,\nto cover short sales and to collateralize derivative\ncontracts and deposits.\nThe following table presents the fair value of\ncollateral accepted.\n(in billions)                                           March 31, 2025                December 31, 2024\nCollateral permitted to be sold or          $  1,652.9                    $  1,544.0\nrepledged, delivered, or otherwise used\nCollateral sold, repledged, delivered or       1,262.1                       1,210.7\notherwise used\n163\nNote 24 – Litigation\nContingencies\nAs of March 31, 2025, the Firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates are defendants or respondents in numerous\nevolving legal proceedings, including private proceedings, public proceedings, government investigations,\nregulatory enforcement matters, and the matters described below. The litigations range from individual actions\ninvolving a single plaintiff to class action lawsuits with potentially millions of class members. Investigations\nand regulatory enforcement matters involve both formal and informal proceedings, by both governmental agencies and\nself-regulatory organizations. These legal proceedings are at varying stages of adjudication, arbitration or\ninvestigation, and involve each of the Firm’s lines of business and several geographies and a wide variety of\nclaims (including common law tort and contract claims and statutory antitrust, securities and consumer protection\nclaims), some of which present novel legal theories. The Firm believes the estimate of the aggregate range of\nreasonably possible losses, in excess of reserves established, for its legal proceedings is from $ 0to\napproximately $ 1.1billion at March 31, 2025. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses was\nbased upon information available as of that date for those proceedings in which the Firm believes that an estimate\nof reasonably possible loss can be made. For certain matters, the Firm does not believe that such an estimate can\nbe made, as of that date. The Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably possible losses involves\nsignificant judgment, given: • the number, variety and varying stages of the proceedings, including the fact that\nmany are in preliminary stages, • the existence in many such proceedings of multiple defendants, including the\nFirm, whose share of liability (if any) has yet to be determined, • the numerous yet-unresolved issues in many of\nthe proceedings, including issues regarding class certification and the scope of many of the claims, and • the\nuncertainty of the various potential outcomes of such proceedings, including where the Firm has made assumptions\nconcerning future rulings by the court or other adjudicator, or about the behavior or incentives of adverse parties\nor regulatory authorities, and those assumptions prove to be incorrect. In addition, the outcome of a particular\nproceeding may be a result which the Firm did not take into account in its estimate because the Firm had deemed the\nlikelihood of that outcome to be remote. Accordingly, the Firm’s estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably\npossible losses will change from time to time, and actual losses may vary significantly. Set forth below are\ndescriptions of the Firm’s material legal proceedings. 1MDB Litigation . J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA was named as a\ndefendant in a civil litigation filed in May 2021 in Malaysia by 1Malaysia Development Berhad (“1MDB”), a Malaysian\nstate-owned and controlled investment fund. The claim alleges “dishonest assistance” against J.P. Morgan (Suisse)\nSA in relation to payments of $ 300million and $ 500million, from 2009 and 2010, respectively, received from 1MDB\nand paid into an account at J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA held by 1MDB PetroSaudi Limited, a joint venture company\nbetween 1MDB and PetroSaudi Holdings (Cayman) Limited. In March 2024, the Court upheld the Firm's challenge to the\nvalidity of service and the Malaysian Court’s jurisdiction to hear the claim. That decision has been appealed by\n1MDB. In August 2023, the Court denied an application by 1MDB to discontinue its claim with permission to re-file a\nnew claim in the future. That decision was appealed by both 1MDB and the Firm, and an appeals court is scheduled to\nhear both appeals in November 2025. In its appeal, the Firm seeks to prevent any claim from continuing. In\naddition, in November 2023, the Federal Office of the Attorney General (OAG) in Switzerland notified J.P. Morgan\n(Suisse) SA that it is conducting an investigation into possible criminal liability in connection with transactions\narising from J.P. Morgan (Suisse) SA’s relationship with the 1MDB PetroSaudi joint venture and its related persons\nfor the period September 2009 through August 2015. The OAG investigation is ongoing. Amrapali . India’s Enforcement\nDirectorate (“ED”) is investigating J.P. Morgan India Private Limited in connection with investments made in 2010\nand 2012 by twooffshore funds formerly managed by JPMorganChase entities into residential housing projects\ndeveloped by the Amrapali Group (“Amrapali”) relating to delays in delivering or failure to deliver residential\nunits. In August 2021, the ED issued an order fining J.P. Morgan India Private Limited approximately $ 31.5million,\nand the Firm is appealing that order. Relatedly, in July 2019, the Supreme Court of India issued an order making\npreliminary findings that Amrapali and other parties, including unspecified JPMorganChase entities and the offshore\nfunds that had invested in the projects, violated certain criminal currency control and money laundering\nprovisions, and ordered the ED to conduct a further inquiry. The Firm is responding to and cooperating with the\ninquiry.\n164\nForeign Exchange Investigations and Litigation. The Firm previously reported settlements with certain government\nauthorities relating to its foreign exchange (“FX”) sales and trading activities and controls related to those\nactivities. Among those resolutions, in May 2015, the Firm pleaded guilty to a single violation of federal\nantitrust law. The Department of Labor (\"DOL\") granted the Firm exemptions that permit the Firm and its affiliates\nto continue to rely on the Qualified Professional Asset Manager exemption under the Employee Retirement Income\nSecurity Act (“ERISA”) through the ten-yeardisqualification period following the antitrust plea. The only remaining\nFX-related governmental inquiry is a South Africa Competition Commission matter which is currently pending before\nthe South Africa Competition Tribunal. With respect to civil litigation matters, some FX-related individual and\nputative class actions filed outside the U.S., including in the U.K., Israel, the Netherlands, Brazil and Australia\nremain. In July 2023, the U.K. Court of Appeal overturned the Competition Appeal Tribunal's earlier denial of a\nrequest for class certification on an opt-out basis. The defendants have appealed this decision to the U.K. Supreme\nCourt. In Israel, a settlement in principle has been reached on the putative class action, which remains subject to\ncourt approval. In Australia, the parties have reached an agreement in principle to settle the class action. The\nsettlement is subject to Court approval. Interchange Litigation. Groups of merchants and retail associations filed\na series of class action complaints alleging that Visa and Mastercard, as well as certain banks, conspired to set\nthe price of credit and debit card interchange fees and enacted related rules in violation of antitrust laws. In\nSeptember 2018, the parties settled the class action seeking monetary relief, with the defendants collectively\ncontributing approximately $ 6.2billion. The settlement has been approved by the United States District Court for\nthe Eastern District of New York and affirmed on appeal. Based on the percentage of merchants that opted out of the\nsettlement, $ 700million has been returned to the defendants from the settlement escrow. A separate class action\nseeking injunctive relief continues, and in September 2021, the District Court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class\ncertification in part, and denied the motion in part. In June 2024, the District Court denied preliminary approval\nof a settlement of the injunctive class action in which Visa and Mastercard agreed to certain changes to their\nrespective network rules and system-wide reductions in interchange rates for U.S.-based merchants. The parties are\nconsidering next steps. Of the merchants who opted out of the damages class settlement, certain merchants filed\nindividual actions raising similar allegations against Visa and Mastercard, as well as against the Firm and other\nbanks. While some of those actions remain pending, the defendants have reached settlements with the merchants who\nopted out representing approximately 80% of the combined Mastercard-branded and Visa-branded payment card sales\nvolume. A number of these actions are pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New\nYork, and that court has scheduled a trial of the claims brought by several merchants to begin in October 2025.\nLIBOR and Other Benchmark Rate Investigations and Litigation . JPMorganChase has responded to inquiries from\nvarious governmental agencies and entities around the world relating primarily to the British Bankers Association’s\n(“BBA”) London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for various currencies and the European Banking Federation’s Euro\nInterbank Offered Rate (“EURIBOR”). The Swiss Competition Commission’s investigation of the Firm relating to\nEURIBOR has been settled, and the Firm paid a penalty and costs of approximately 9million Swiss franc. The Firm\nappealed a December 2016 decision by the European Commission against the Firm and other banks finding an\ninfringement of European antitrust rules relating to EURIBOR. In December 2023, the European General Court annulled\nthe fine imposed by the European Commission, but exercised its discretion to re-impose a fine in an identical\namount. In March 2024, the Firm filed an appeal of this decision with the Court of Justice of the European Union.\nIn addition, the Firm has been named as a defendant along with other banks in various individual and putative class\nactions related to benchmark rates, including U.S. dollar LIBOR. In actions related to U.S. dollar LIBOR during the\nperiod that it was administered by the BBA, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York\ngranted class certification of antitrust claims related to bonds and interest rate swaps sold directly by the\ndefendants, including the Firm. The Firm has obtained dismissal of certain actions and resolved certain other\nactions, and as to all remaining actions has moved for summary judgment. In addition, a lawsuit filed by a group of\nindividual plaintiffs asserting antitrust claims, alleging that the Firm and other defendants were engaged in an\nunlawful agreement to set U.S. dollar LIBOR and conspired to monopolize the market for LIBOR-based consumer loans\nand credit cards was dismissed in October 2023 and affirmed on appeal by the United States Court of Appeals for the\nNinth Circuit in December 2024. The Firm has resolved all non-U.S. dollar LIBOR actions. Russian Litigation. The\nFirm is obligated to comply with international sanctions laws, which mandate the blocking of certain assets. These\nlaws apply when assets associated with individuals, companies, products or services are within the scope of the\n165\nsanctions. The Firm has faced actual and threatened litigation in Russia seeking payments that the Firm cannot make\nunder, and is contractually excused from paying as a result of, relevant sanctions laws. In claims involving the\nFirm and claims filed against other financial institutions, Russian courts have disregarded the parties’\ncontractual agreements concerning forum selection and did not recognize foreign sanctions laws as a basis for not\nmaking payment. Russian courts have entered judgment against the Firm in a number of claims, including one for $\n439million, and a judgment has been executed against assets held onshore by the Firm in Russia. The total amount of\nthe judgments exceeds the total amount of available assets that the Firm holds in Russia. The Firm continues to\nappeal the Russian courts' decisions, and judgments may not be executed while on appeal. Russian courts have also\nordered interim freezes of Firm assets in Russia (including, among other things, funds in bank accounts,\nsecurities, shares in authorized capital, and certain trademarks, of the named defendants) pending a determination\nof certain underlying claims against the Firm. The Firm has challenged claims being pursued in the Russian courts\nand related freeze orders in other jurisdictions provided for by the parties’ contractual forum selections. If\nfurther claims are enforced despite the actions taken by the Firm to challenge the claims and orders and to seek\nthe proper application of law, the Firm’s assets in Russia could be seized in full, and certain client assets could\nalso be seized, or the Firm could be prevented from complying with its obligations. Shareholder Litigation .\nSeveral shareholder putative class actions, as well as shareholder derivative actions purporting to act on behalf\nof the Firm, have been filed against the Firm, its Board of Directors and certain of its current and former\nofficers. Certain of these shareholder suits relate to historical trading practices by former employees in the\nprecious metals and U.S. treasuries markets and related conduct which were the subject of the Firm’s resolutions\nwith the DOJ, CFTC and SEC in September 2020, and fiduciary activities that were separately the subject of a\nresolution between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and the OCC in November 2020. One of these shareholder derivative\nsuits was filed in the Supreme Court of the State of New York in May 2022, asserting breach of fiduciary duty and\nunjust enrichment claims relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct and fiduciary activities\nwhich were the subject of the resolutions described above. In December 2022, the court granted defendants’ motion\nto dismiss this action in full, and in April 2025 the appellate court affirmed the dismissal. A second shareholder\nderivative action relating to the historical trading practices and related conduct was filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the Eastern District of New York in December 2022. Defendants have moved to dismiss the\ncomplaint. Zelle Network Litigation. In December 2024, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) filed a\ncomplaint against Early Warning Services, LLC (“EWS”), Bank of America, N.A., Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and JPMorgan\nChase Bank, N.A. in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The CFPB alleged that EWS and the\ndefendant banks failed to take sufficient efforts to prevent fraud on the Zelle network. In March 2025, the Court\ndismissed the complaint with prejudice at the request of the CFPB. * * * In addition to the various legal\nproceedings discussed above, JPMorganChase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved\nin a substantial number of other legal proceedings. The Firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims\nasserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously.\nAdditional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future. The Firm has established reserves\nfor several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings. In accordance with the provisions of U.S. GAAP\nfor contingencies, the Firm accrues for a litigation-related liability when it is probable that such a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Firm evaluates its outstanding legal\nproceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves, and makes adjustments in such reserves, upward or\ndownward, as appropriate, based on management’s best judgment after consultation with counsel. The Firm’s legal\nexpense was $ 121million and $( 72) million for the three months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, respectively. There\nis no assurance that the Firm’s litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future. In view of the\ninherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings, particularly where the claimants seek very\nlarge or indeterminate damages, or where the matters present novel legal theories, involve a large number of\nparties or are in early stages of discovery, the Firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual\noutcomes of the currently pending matters, the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses, fines,\npenalties or consequences related to those matters. JPMorganChase believes, based upon its current knowledge and\nafter consultation with counsel, consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking\ninto account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses, that the other\nlegal proceedings currently pending against it should not\n166\nhave a material adverse effect on the Firm’s consolidated financial condition. The Firm notes, however, that in\nlight of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings, there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of\nthese matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have\nmaterial reputational consequences. As a result, the outcome of a particular matter may be material to\nJPMorganChase’s operating results for a particular period, depending on, among other factors, the size of the loss\nor liability imposed and the level of JPMorganChase’s income for that period.\n167\nNote 25 – Business segments & Corporate\nThe Firm is managed on an LOB basis. There are threereportable business segments – Consumer & Community Banking,\nCommercial & Investment Bank, and Asset & Wealth Management – with the remaining activities in Corporate. The\nbusiness segments are determined based on the products and services provided, or the type of customer served, and\nthey reflect the manner in which financial information is evaluated by the Firm’s Operating Committee, whose\nmembers act collectively as the Firm’s chief operating decision maker. Segment results are presented on a managed\nbasis. Refer to JPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K Explanation and Reconciliation of the Firm’s Use of Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures on page 67 for a definition of managed basis and Note 32 for a further discussion of the Firm’s\nbusiness segments. Description of business segment reporting methodology Results of the reportable business\nsegments are intended to present each segment as if it were a stand-alone business. The management reporting\nprocess that derives business segment results includes the allocation of certain income and expense items. The Firm\nperiodically assesses the assumptions, methodologies and reporting classifications used for segment reporting, and\ntherefore further refinements may be implemented in future periods. The Firm also assesses the level of capital\nrequired for each LOB on at least an annual basis. The Firm’s LOBs also provide various business metrics which are\nutilized by the Firm and its investors and analysts in assessing performance. Revenue sharing When business\nsegments or businesses within each segment join efforts to sell products and services to the Firm’s clients and\ncustomers, the participating businesses may agree to share revenue from those transactions. Revenue is generally\nrecognized in the segment responsible for the related product or service, with allocations to the other segments or\nbusinesses involved in the transaction. The segment and business results reflect these revenue-sharing agreements.\nFunds transfer pricing Funds transfer pricing (“FTP”) is the process by which the Firm allocates interest income\nand expense to the LOBs and Other Corporate and transfers the primary interest rate risk and liquidity risk to\nTreasury and CIO. The funds transfer pricing process considers the interest rate and liquidity risk characteristics\nof assets and liabilities and off-balance sheet products. Periodically, the methodology and assumptions utilized in\nthe FTP process are adjusted to reflect economic conditions and other factors, which may impact the allocation of\nnet interest income to the segments. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Firm updated its FTP with respect\nto consumer deposits, which resulted in an increase in the funding benefit reflected within CCB’s net interest\nincome that is fully offset in Corporate, with no effect on the Firm’s net interest income. As a result of lower\naverage interest rates in the current period, the cost of funding for assets and the funding benefit earned for\nliabilities generally decreased compared with the prior year. Foreign exchange risk Foreign exchange risk is\ntransferred from the LOBs and Other Corporate to Treasury and CIO for certain revenues and expenses. Treasury and\nCIO manages these risks centrally and reports the impact of foreign exchange rate movements related to the\ntransferred risk in its results. Capital allocation The amount of capital assigned to each LOB and Corporate is\nreferred to as equity. At least annually, the assumptions, judgments and methodologies used to allocate capital are\nreassessed and, as a result, the capital allocated to the LOBs and Corporate may change. Refer to Note 32 of\nJPMorganChase’s 2024 Form 10-K for additional information on capital allocation.\n168\nSegment & Corporate results The following table provides a summary of the Firm’s segment results as of or for the\nthree months ended March 31, 2025 and 2024, on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts with\nthe reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm\n(and each of the reportable business segments) on an FTE basis. Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive\ntax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable\ninvestments and securities.

In our opinion, the information\nset forth in the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheet information as of December 31, 2024, is fairly\nstated, in all material respects, in relation to the\nconsolidated balance sheet from which it has been\nderived.\nBasis for Review Results\nThese interim financial statements are the\nresponsibility of the Firm’s management. We are a\npublic accounting firm registered with the Public\nCompany Accounting Oversight Board (United States)\n(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with\nrespect to the Firm in accordance with the U.S.\nfederal securities laws and the applicable rules and\nregulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission\nand the PCAOB. We conducted our review in accordance\nwith the standards of the PCAOB. A review of interim\nfinancial information consists principally of applying\nanalytical procedures and making inquiries of persons\nresponsible for financial and accounting matters. It\nis substantially less in scope than an audit conducted\nin accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the\nobjective of which is the expression of an opinion\nregarding the financial statements taken as a whole.\nAccordingly, we do not express such an opinion.\nMay 1, 2025\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, 300 Madison Avenue, New York, NY 10017\n170\nJPMorg…\nChase

Upon the occurrence of a credit event by the\nreference entity, which may include, among other\nevents, the bankruptcy or failure to pay its\nobligations, or certain restructurings of the debt of\nthe reference entity, neither party has recourse to\nthe reference entity. The protection purchaser has\nrecourse to the protection seller for the difference\nbetween the face value of the CDS contract and the\nfair value at the time of settling the credit\nderivative contract.

An\ninstrument containing such terms or features is\nreferred to as a “hybrid.” The component of the hybrid\nthat is the non-derivative instrument is referred to\nas the “host.” For example, callable debt is a hybrid\ninstrument that contains a plain vanilla debt\ninstrument (i.e., the host) and an embedded option\nthat allows the issuer to redeem the debt issue at a\nspecified date for a specified amount (i.e., the\nembedded derivative). However, a floating rate\ninstrument is not a hybrid composed of a fixed-rate\ninstrument and an interest rate swap.\nEPS: Earnings per share\nERISA: Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\nESG: Environmental, Social and Governance\nETD: “Exchange-traded derivatives”: Derivative\ncontracts that are executed on an exchange and settled\nvia a central clearing house.\nEU: European Union\nExpense categories:\nVolume- and/or revenue-related expenses generally\ncorrelate with changes in the related\nbusiness/transaction volume or revenue.

The\ncurrent estimated LTV ratios are calculated using\nestimated collateral values derived from a nationally\nrecognized home price index measured at the\nmetropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) level. These\nMSA-level home price indices consist of actual data to\nthe extent available and forecasted data where actual\ndata is not available. As a result, the estimated\ncollateral values used to calculate these ratios do\nnot represent actual appraised loan-level collateral\nvalues; as such, the resulting LTV ratios are\nnecessarily imprecise and should therefore be viewed\nas estimates.\nCombined LTV ratio\nThe LTV ratio considering all available lien\npositions, as well as unused lines, related to the\nproperty. Combined LTV ratios are used for junior lien\nhome equity products.\nMacro businesses: the macro businesses include Rates,\nCurrencies and Emerging Markets, Fixed Income\nFinancing and Commodities in CIB's Fixed Income\nMarkets.\nManaged basis: A non-GAAP presentation of Firmwide\nfinancial results that includes reclassifications to\npresent revenue on a fully taxable-equivalent basis.\nManagement also uses this financial measure at the\nsegment level, because it believes this provides\ninformation to enable investors to understand the\nunderlying operational performance and trends of the\nparticular business segment and facilitates a\ncomparison of the business segment with the\nperformance of competitors.\nMarkets: consists of CIB's Fixed Income Markets and\nEquity Markets businesses.\nMaster netting agreement: A single agreement with a\ncounterparty that permits multiple transactions\ngoverned by that agreement to be terminated or\naccelerated and settled through a single payment in a\nsingle currency in the event of a default (e.g.,\nbankruptcy, failure to make a required payment or\nsecurities transfer or deliver collateral or margin\nwhen due).\nMBS: Mortgage-backed securities\nMD&A: Management’s discussion and analysis\nMeasurement alternative : Measures equity securities\nwithout readily determinable fair values at cost less\n174\nimpairment (if any), plus or minus observable price\nchanges from an identical or similar investment of the\nsame issuer.\nMerchant Services: offers merchants payment processing\ncapabilities, fraud and risk management, data and\nanalytics, and other payments services. Through\nMerchant Services, merchants of all sizes can accept\npayments via credit and debit cards and payments in\nmultiple currencies.\nMEV: Macroeconomic variable\nMoody’s : Moody’s Investor Services\nMortgage product types :\nAlt-A\nAlt-A loans are generally higher in credit quality\nthan subprime loans but have characteristics that\nwould disqualify the borrower from a traditional prime\nloan. Alt-A lending characteristics may include one or\nmore of the following: (i) limited documentation; (ii)\na high CLTV ratio; (iii) loans secured by non-owner\noccupied properties; or (iv) a debt-to-income ratio\nabove normal limits. A substantial proportion of the\nFirm’s Alt-A loans are those where a borrower does not\nprovide complete documentation of his or her assets or\nthe amount or source of his or her income.\nOption ARMs\nThe option ARM real estate loan product is an\nadjustable-rate mortgage loan that provides the\nborrower with the option each month to make a fully\namortizing, interest-only or minimum payment. The\nminimum payment on an option ARM loan is based on the\ninterest rate charged during the introductory period.\nThis introductory rate is usually significantly below\nthe fully indexed rate. The fully indexed rate is\ncalculated using an index rate plus a margin. Once the\nintroductory period ends, the contractual interest\nrate charged on the loan increases to the fully\nindexed rate and adjusts monthly to reflect movements\nin the index. The minimum payment is typically\ninsufficient to cover interest accrued in the prior\nmonth, and any unpaid interest is deferred and added\nto the principal balance of the loan. Option ARM loans\nare subject to payment recast, which converts the loan\nto a variable-rate fully amortizing loan upon meeting\nspecified loan balance and anniversary date triggers.\nPrime\nPrime mortgage loans are made to borrowers with good\ncredit records who meet specific underwriting\nrequirements, including prescriptive requirements\nrelated to income and overall debt levels. New prime\nmortgage borrowers provide full documentation and\ngenerally have reliable payment histories.\nSubprime\nSubprime loans are loans that, prior to mid-2008, were\noffered to certain customers with one or more high\nrisk characteristics, including but not limited to:\n(i)\nunreliable or poor payment histories; (ii) a high LTV\nratio of greater than 80% (without borrower-paid\nmortgage insurance); (iii) a high debt-to-income\nratio; (iv) an occupancy type for the loan is other\nthan the borrower’s primary residence; or (v) a\nhistory of delinquencies or late payments on the loan.\nMREL : Minimum requirements for own funds and eligible\nliabilities\nMSR : Mortgage servicing rights\nNA : Data is not applicable or available for the\nperiod presented.\nNet Capital Rule: Rule 15c3-1 under the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934.\nNet charge-off/(recovery) rate: represents net charge-\noffs/(recoveries) (annualized) divided by average\nretained loans for the reporting period.\nNet interchange income includes the following\ncomponents:\nInterchange income: Fees earned by credit and debit\ncard issuers on sales transactions.\nRewards costs: The cost to the Firm for points\nearned by cardholders enrolled in credit card rewards\nprograms generally tied to sales transactions.\nPartner payments: Payments to co-brand credit card\npartners based on the cost of loyalty program rewards\nearned by cardholders on credit card transactions.\nNet yield on interest-earning assets: The average rate\nfor interest-earning assets less the average rate paid\nfor all sources of funds.\nNFA: National Futures Association\nNM : Not meaningful\nNonaccrual loans : Loans for which interest income is\nnot recognized on an accrual basis. Loans (other than\ncredit card loans and certain consumer loans insured\nby U.S. government agencies) are placed on nonaccrual\nstatus when full payment of principal and interest is\nnot expected, regardless of delinquency status, or\nwhen principal and interest has been in default for a\nperiod of 90 days or more unless the loan is both\nwell-secured and in the process of collection.\nCollateral-dependent loans are typically maintained on\nnonaccrual status.\nNonperforming assets: Nonperforming assets include\nnonaccrual loans, nonperforming derivatives and\ncertain assets acquired in loan satisfactions,\npredominantly real estate owned and other commercial\nand personal property.\nNSFR: Net Stable Funding Ratio\nOCC : Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\nOCI : Other comprehensive income/(loss)\n175\nOPEB : Other postretirement employee benefit\nOperating losses: Primarily refer to fraud losses\nassociated with customer deposit accounts, credit and\ndebit cards; exclude legal expense\nOTC : “Over-the-counter derivatives”: Derivative\ncontracts that are negotiated, executed and settled\nbilaterally between two derivative counterparties,\nwhere one or both counterparties is a derivatives\ndealer.\nOTC cleared : “Over-the-counter cleared derivatives”:\nDerivative contracts that are negotiated and executed\nbilaterally, but subsequently settled via a central\nclearing house, such that each derivative counterparty\nis only exposed to the default of that clearing house.\nOverhead ratio: Noninterest expense as a percentage of\ntotal net revenue.\nParent Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.\nParticipating securities: represents unvested share-\nbased compensation awards containing nonforfeitable\nrights to dividends or dividend equivalents\n(collectively, “dividends”), which are included in the\nearnings per share calculation using the two-class\nmethod. JPMorganChase grants restricted stock and RSUs\nto certain employees under its share-based\ncompensation programs, which entitle the recipients to\nreceive nonforfeitable dividends during the vesting\nperiod on a basis equivalent to the dividends paid to\nholders of common stock. These unvested awards meet\nthe definition of participating securities. Under the\ntwo-class method, all earnings (distributed and\nundistributed) are allocated to each class of common\nstock and participating securities, based on their\nrespective rights to receive dividends.\nPCD: “Purchased credit deteriorated” assets represent\nacquired financial assets that as of the date of\nacquisition have experienced a more-than-insignificant\ndeterioration in credit quality since origination, as\ndetermined by the Firm.\nPillar 1: The Basel framework consists of a three\n“Pillar” approach. Pillar 1 establishes minimum\ncapital requirements, defines eligible capital\ninstruments, and prescribes rules for calculating RWA.\nPillar 3: The Basel framework consists of a three\n“Pillar” approach. Pillar 3 encourages market\ndiscipline through disclosure requirements which allow\nmarket participants to assess the risk and capital\nprofiles of banks.\nPRA: Prudential Regulation Authority\nPreferred stock dividends: reflects dividends declared\nand deemed dividends upon redemption of preferred\nstock\nPre-provision profit/(loss): represents total net\nrevenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes\nthat this financial measure is useful in assessing the\nability of a lending institution to generate income in\nexcess of its provision for credit losses.\nPrincipal transactions revenue : Principal\ntransactions revenue is driven by many factors,\nincluding the bid-offer spread, which is the\ndifference between the price at which the Firm is\nwilling to buy a financial or other instrument and the\nprice at which the Firm is willing to sell that\ninstrument. It also consists of realized (as a result\nof closing out or termination of transactions, or\ninterim cash payments) and unrealized (as a result of\nchanges in valuation) gains and losses on financial\nand other instruments (including those accounted for\nunder the fair value option) primarily used in client-\ndriven market-making activities and on private equity\ninvestments. In connection with its client-driven\nmarket-making activities, the Firm transacts in debt\nand equity instruments, derivatives and commodities\n(including physical commodities inventories and\nfinancial instruments that reference commodities).\nPrincipal transactions revenue also includes certain\nrealized and unrealized gains and losses related to\nhedge accounting and specified risk-management\nactivities, including: (a) certain derivatives\ndesignated in qualifying hedge accounting\nrelationships (primarily fair value hedges of\ncommodity and foreign exchange risk), (b) certain\nderivatives used for specific risk management\npurposes, primarily to mitigate credit risk and\nforeign exchange risk, and (c) other derivatives.\nPSU(s) : Performance share units\nRegulatory VaR: Daily aggregated VaR calculated in\naccordance with regulatory rules.\nREO: Real estate owned\nReported basis: Financial statements prepared under\nU.S. GAAP, which excludes the impact of taxable-\nequivalent adjustments.\nRetained loans : Loans that are held-for-investment\n(i.e. excludes loans held-for-sale and loans at fair\nvalue).\nRevenue wallet: Total fee revenue based on estimates\nof investment banking fees generated across the\nindustry (i.e., the revenue wallet) from investment\nbanking transactions in M&A, equity and debt\nunderwriting, and loan syndications.

Key differences in the calculation\nof credit risk RWA between the Standardized and\nAdvanced approaches are that for Basel III Advanced,\ncredit risk RWA is based on risk-sensitive approaches\nwhich largely rely on the use of internal credit\nmodels and parameters, whereas for Basel III\nStandardized, credit risk RWA is generally based on\nsupervisory risk-weightings which vary primarily by\ncounterparty type and asset class. Market risk RWA is\ncalculated on a generally consistent basis between\nBasel III Standardized and Basel III Advanced.\nS&P : Standard and Poors\nSA-CCR: Standardized Approach for Counterparty Credit\nRisk\nSAR as it pertains to Hong Kong: Special\nAdministrative Region\nSAR(s) as it pertains to employee stock awards : Stock\nappreciation rights\nSCB : Stress capital buffer\nScored portfolios: Consumer loan portfolios that\npredominantly include residential real estate loans,\ncredit card loans, auto loans to individuals and\ncertain small business loans.\nSEC : U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\nSecuritized Products Group: Comprised of Securitized\nProducts and tax-oriented investments.\nSeed capital: Initial JPMorgan capital invested in\nproducts, such as mutual funds, with the intention of\nensuring the fund is of sufficient size to represent a\nviable offering to clients, enabling pricing of its\nshares, and allowing the manager to develop a track\nrecord.

All ratings, the assigned peer\ncategories and the asset values used to derive these\nrankings are sourced from the applicable fund rating\nprovider. Where applicable, the fund rating providers\nredenominate asset values into U.S. dollars. The\npercentage of AUM is based on star ratings at the\nshare class level for U.S.-domiciled funds, and at a\n“primary share class” level to represent the star\nrating of all other funds, except for Japan, for which\nNomura provides ratings at the fund level. The\nperformance data may have been different if all share\nclasses had been included. Past performance is not\nindicative of future results.\nPercentage of active mutual fund and active ETF assets\nunder management in funds ranked in the 1st or 2nd\nquartile (one, three, and five years): All quartile\nrankings, the assigned peer categories and the asset\nvalues used to derive these rankings are sourced from\nthe fund rating providers. Quartile rankings are based\non the net-of-fee absolute return of each fund. Where\napplicable, the fund rating providers redenominate\nasset values into U.S. dollars. The percentage of AUM\nis based on fund performance and associated peer\nrankings at the share class level for U.S.-domiciled\nfunds, at a “primary share class” level to represent\nthe quartile ranking for U.K., Luxembourg and Hong\nKong funds and at the fund level for all other funds.\nThe performance data may have been different if all\nshare classes had been included. Past performance is\nnot indicative of future results.\n“ Primary share class ” means the C share class for\nEuropean funds and Acc share class for Hong Kong and\nTaiwan funds. If these share classes are not\navailable, the oldest share class is used as the\nprimary share class.\n180",
