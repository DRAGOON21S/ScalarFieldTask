On April 4, 2023, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary LTL Management LLC (LTL) has re-filed for
voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection to obtain approval of a reorganization plan that will efficiently
resolve all current and future claims arising from cosmetic talc litigation against the Company and its affiliates
in North America. The Company has agreed to contribute up to the present value of $8.9 billion over 25 years
(nominal value approximately $12 billion) to resolve the North America talc claims, resulting in a first fiscal
quarter charge of $6.9 billion above the $2 billion previously committed in connection with LTL’s initial
bankruptcy filing in October 2021. Johnson & Johnson and its other affiliates did not file for bankruptcy
protection and will continue to operate their businesses as usual. The press release further discussing this
announcement is attached below as Exhibit 99.1.
