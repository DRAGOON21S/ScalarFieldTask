                               CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS                                
                                                                                                                   
This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Johnson & Johnson's other publicly available documents contain “ forward-
looking statements ” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the
Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and
projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,”
“expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other
things: discussions of future operations, expected operating results, financial performance; impact of planned
acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives including associated cost savings and
other benefits; the Company's strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market
position and expenditures.

Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future
events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are
outside of the Company's control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or
known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could
vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors
are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are
not limited to:

Risks Related to Product Development, Market Success and Competition

• Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies
on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional
analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and
initial and continued commercial success;

• Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights
for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;

• The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or
other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;

• Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to
launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States
Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market
exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;

• Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can
result in product and process obsolescence;

• Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing
agreements for products and technologies;

• Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by
competitors; and

• Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third
parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the
payment of money damages and future royalties.

Risks Related to Product Liability, Litigation and Regulatory Activity

• Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in
product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (or
international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share price
impact;

• The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action
adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing
practices and contracting strategies;

• The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings,
including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government
investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;

• Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in
investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but
not limited to, debarment from government business;

• Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which
could result in significant sanctions;

• Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations,
including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare
products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products and services; environmental protection;
and sourcing of raw materials;

• Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its
products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other
requirements such as the European Union’s Medical Devices Regulation;

• Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities
around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and

• The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Risks Related to the Company’s Strategic Initiatives, Healthcare Market Trends and the Planned Separation of the
Company’s Consumer Health Business

• Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation
among healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments
increasingly becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, significant new entrants to the healthcare markets
seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases;

• Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and
services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;

• Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced
innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and
the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures;

• The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or
divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;

• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may
not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;

• The Company’s ability to consummate the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business on a timely
basis or at all;

• The Company’s ability to successfully separate the Company’s Consumer Health business and realize the anticipated
benefits from the planned separation; and

• The New Consumer Health Company’s ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company.

Risks Related to Economic Conditions, Financial Markets and Operating Internationally

• The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign
governments in countries in which the Company operates;

• Market conditions and the possibility that the Company’s share repurchase program may be delayed, suspended or
discontinued;

• The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect
of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;

• Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other
countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;

• The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk,
possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international
governments and legal systems;

• The impact of global public health crises and pandemics, including the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic;

• Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company’s
products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of
goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company’s products
and operations; and

• The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including
social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.
                                                                                                                   
  Risks Related to Supply Chain and Operations                                                                     
                                                                                                                   
• Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the
supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages,
withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;

• Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the Company’s vendors,
which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and
regulatory action;

• Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to
increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the
Company’s products; and

• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions contemplated for the
global supply chain may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required
approvals from applicable regulatory authorities.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1 — The accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements and related notes should be read in
conjunction with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the
Company) and related notes as contained in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
January 2, 2022. The unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal
recurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair statement of the results for
the periods presented.

Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-
rounded figures.
Use of Estimates
The extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving
factors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact
worldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, inflation, employment rates and health insurance
coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The
Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial
information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts
COVID-19 as of October 2, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but
were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and
associated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other assets. While there was not a material impact
to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the quarter ended October 2, 2022, the Company’s
future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material
impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.
New Accounting Standards
The Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any,
from the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022.
Recently Adopted Accounting Standards
There were no new material accounting standards adopted in the fiscal third quarter of 2022.

NOTE 3 — INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND GOODWILL

Intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. The latest annual
impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter
of 2021. Future impairment tests for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will be performed annually in
the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner, if warranted.

(1) The change in intangible assets with definite lives is primarily the result of currency translation effects.
(2) The majority is comprised of customer relationships
(3) In the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of
approximately $ 0.6billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an
investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). Additional
information regarding efficacy of the AD indication became available which led the Company to the decision to
terminate the development of bermekimab for AD. The remaining reduction was driven by assets that reached
commercialization and are now classified as having definite lives.
In October 2022, subsequent to the fiscal third quarter, additional information regarding efficacy of the HS
indication became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for
HS. The Company will record a charge of approximately $ 0.2billion in the fiscal fourth quarter related to this
impairment. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020.
Goodwill as of October 2, 2022 was allocated by segment of business as follows:

NOTE 4 — FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows,
primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany product and third-party purchases of
materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency
risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.

Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed
rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest
rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company
uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.
These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of
these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign
currency assets and liabilities.

The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that
contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain
derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting
agreements. As of October 2, 2022, the cumulative amount of cash collateral received by the Company under the CSA
amounted to $ 0.8billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company
monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the
Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit
rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this
footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of October 2, 2022, the Company had
notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and
interest rate swaps of $ 47.1billion, $ 36.2billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively. As of January 2, 2022, the
Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps
and interest rate swaps of $ 45.8billion, $ 37.4billion and $ 10.0billion respectively.

All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the
derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.

The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all
derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are
accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in
the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then
reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.

Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to
changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on
net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other
comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense
using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly
effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly
effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.

The Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a
net investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as
their functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.

As of October 2, 2022, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive
income was $ 922million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive
Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange
contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected
to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is
18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount ultimately realized in
earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual
exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

For equity investments without readily determinable market values, there was a decrease of $ 29million in the fair
value reflected in net income as a result of impairments.

In the fiscal third quarter ended October 2, 2022, the Company sold all its equity investments in argenx SE for
proceeds of $ 0.6billion.

Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is
a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest
priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.

The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate
contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the
prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange
rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the
amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material
effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity
investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds
acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are
classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques
for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.

The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.

Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

NOTE 5 — INCOME TAXES

The worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal nine months of 2022 and 2021 were 17.7% and 10.0%,
respectively. This increase in the consolidated tax rate as compared to the prior year fiscal nine months is
primarily due to the Company reorganizing the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international
subsidiaries in the second fiscal quarter of 2021. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax
basis of certain assets to fair value in accordance with the applicable local regulations. Accordingly, the Company
recorded a local deferred tax benefit of approximately $ 2.3billion which was partially offset by a related
increase in the U.S. GILTI deferred tax liability of approximately $ 1.7billion. The net impact of this
reorganization was an approximate $ 0.6billion net benefit or a 3.4% decrease to the effective tax rate of the
fiscal nine months of 2021.

Additionally, the following items had an unfavorable impact to the Company’s year-to-date effective tax rate as
compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year:

• as part of the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business (for further information see Note 1
in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022) the Company has recognized
approximately $ 0.4billion in net incremental tax costs which increased the rate by approximately 2.0% for the
fiscal nine months of 2022

• certain one-time favorable tax items that occurred during the fiscal nine months of 2021 and resulted in an
approximate 1.0% benefit to the effective tax rate, but were not repeated in fiscal 2022

• In the fiscal third quarter of 2021 the Company had accrued additional Talc expenses of $ 1.4billion at an
effective tax rate of 23.5% and $ 0.8billion for the Risperdal Gynecomastia settlement at an effective tax rate of
16.4%. (See note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details)

• in the fiscal third quarter of 2021 the Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion for the Ottava
intangible asset (acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%

The Company also had additional tax benefits received from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or
vested during the first three fiscal quarters of 2022 and 2021. The Company’s 2022 tax rate benefited primarily
from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that became effective in fiscal 2022, the impairment
of bermekimab for AD IPR&D (for further information see Note 3 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) and
changes in the fair value of securities in the Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory
rate.

As of October 2, 2022, the Company had approximately $ 3.8billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits.
The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress
in a number of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its audit for the tax years
through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In other major jurisdictions where the Company
conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back to the year 2008. The Company believes it is
possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions
outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the
timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax positions.

NOTE 11 — LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product
liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and
other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.

The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a
liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of October 2, 2022, the
Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be
reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal
issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance
with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is
probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the
amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about
future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related
payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among
other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal
discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal
uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and
unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;
complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent
adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an
accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.

In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with
counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or
increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.

PRODUCT LIABILITY

Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits
involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive
damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome
of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements
based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits
in compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The
Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable
and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as
estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent
projected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and
with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information
becomes available.

The most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing
System; the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; XARELTO; body powders containing talc,
primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder; INVOKANA; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh. As of October 2, 2022,
in the United States there were approximately 180plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding
injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; 1,400with
respect to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; 9,400with respect to pelvic meshes; 1,500with respect to RISPERDAL;
600with respect to XARELTO; 40,300with respect to body powders containing talc; 5with respect to INVOKANA;
4,800with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; and 1,900with respect to ELMIRON. The number of
pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are
filed.

In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular
System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury
have been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been
organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed
committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip
patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR
                                                        29

Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March
2017, which further extended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after
August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby
bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the
United States remain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In
Australia, a class action settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in
that country. In Canada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The
Company continues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on
a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement
program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.

Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson
(collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product
liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential
costs and the anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been
organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas
(Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases
into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has
been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Prior to 2019, several adverse verdicts
had been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first
quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the
settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product
liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.

Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of
Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company
continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal
courts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL.
The MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional
pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved
the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining
cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or
claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in
various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada. In November
2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation
to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments
and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and
pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court issued a decision and entered damages awards to the three Lead
Applicants. The Company appealed the decision to the intermediate appellate court, the Full Court. The appeal was
heard in February 2021 and, in March 2021, the Full Court entered a judgment dismissing the appeal. An application
for special leave to the High Court of Australia was filed in April 2021, and the High Court heard oral argument on
the application in November 2021. Special leave was refused. In September 2022, the Company reached an in-principle
agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia, pending Federal Court approval. The class
actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to
resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently
finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the settlement was filed with the Court. The Company
has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh
products.

Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),
claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal
injury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have
been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic
County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional
lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL
for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed
for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, one multi-plaintiff lawsuit pending in Oklahoma state
court and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs
entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs)
pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and
includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed
pending the completion of the settlement agreement. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject
to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of October 2022, there are
approximately 154active cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.
                                                        30

Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the
PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an
order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases
have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United
States.

Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE
Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County
Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state
courts in the United States.

The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON
PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System
products.

Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out
of the use of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed
episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been
filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the
United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive
information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully
defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October
2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in
January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing
plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs
associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.

Claims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer Healthcare AG,
and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-
district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases
were filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort
litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action
lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and Johnson & Johnson announced an agreement in
principle to settle the XARELTO cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the
settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority
of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the
United States settlement program and XARELTO related product liability litigation.

A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson
Consumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S
Baby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States
as well as outside of the United States, continued to increase.

In talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there
also have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri
Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson &
Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer
of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari,
seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company
paid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances,
including the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought
against the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc
verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in
certain circumstances the Company has settled cases.

In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021
Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were
created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a
North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,
Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets
and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in
any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or
exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such
damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’
compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).
                                                        31

In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a
voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte
Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL
Bankruptcy Case, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation
against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the
stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-
related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified
retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties). The LTL Bankruptcy Case was
transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court
extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and,
following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March
2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected
Parties. The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the
extension of the stay. In May 2022, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The
briefing and oral argument on the appeal were completed in September 2022. While the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court’s
order effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-related personal injury litigation, LTL has agreed to lift the
stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been filed.

The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court
determines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $ 2billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company
has established a reserve for approximately $ 2billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. After and as a
result of the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party. The
impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet reached a resolution of all
talc matters in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss
beyond the amount accrued.

A class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey
state court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that J&J
fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc mined,
milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by Johnson & Johnson’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor
Minerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the
Edley Class Action to federal court in the District of New Jersey. In July 2022, Imerys filed a motion in the
Imerys Bankruptcy to stay the Edley Class Action, which was denied in August 2022. In October 2022, the Company
filed motions to dismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey
District Court.

In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc
Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of
the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware
(Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from
exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for
indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort
Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents)
filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto. The Plan Proponents
have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s
Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure Statement,
allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan.

In March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April
2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the
Plan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify
those votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn.

In October 2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, and certain of
Imerys’s insurers (the Mediation Parties) agreed to engage in mediation. The term of the mediation ended in
September 2022.

In July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys
Adversary Proceeding). The Imerys Adversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with
respect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously
filed a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from
undergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The
Bankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The
Bankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of
Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL
Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys Adversary Proceeding.

In June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC) (together, Cyprus),
which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the
Imerys Bankruptcy
                                                        32

seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding).
The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In February
2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure
Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants
where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an
injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain protected parties. Cyprus has not yet sought
approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR appointed in the Cyprus chapter
11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October 2021, the Company filed
a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of
the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding. In June 2022, Cyprus commenced an
Adversary Proceeding in its chapter 11 case seeking an order enforcing the automatic stay by enjoining parties from
commencing or continuing “talc-related claims” against CAMC. In June 2022, the court entered a preliminary
injunction order enjoining claimants from pursuing talc-related claims against CAMC through January 2023.

In February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the
Coverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the
automatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic
stay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a
limited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying
the stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of
Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL
Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action. In March 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court ruled that the
LTL automatic stay applied to the Coverage Action.

In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers
in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the
federal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc,
primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.
Plaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion
was complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020,
the Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was
completed. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion
for class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement
the class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. In March 2022, LTL asked the New Jersey
Bankruptcy Court to stay the securities class action. In April 2022, Defendants filed a second motion to supplement
the class certification record. In May 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the
securities class action. Plaintiff has appealed the Bankruptcy Court’s order.

In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against
Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current directors and certain officers as defendants in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the
alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that Johnson &
Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were
consolidated into a single action under the caption In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation
. In July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the
Board to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the
Board received raising similar issues and demanding that suit be brought against certain Directors. Four of the
shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in th e In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation
. The independent counsel recommended that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are
necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the
recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated
complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint. In March 2021,
Plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery. The Court temporarily terminated Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss
pending a decision on Plaintiff’s motion for discovery. In July 2022, the Court denied Plaintiff’s discovery
motion. In August 2022, the Court reopened Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss. In lieu of opposing, Plaintiff
made a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case, which the Court granted in October 2022.

In January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan
against Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States
District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by
offering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do
so because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily
JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed a
motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020,
Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of
October 2020, briefing on Defendants’ motion was complete. In February 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion,
and granted Plaintiffs leave to amend. In April 2021, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they did not intend to
file an amended complaint, and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. In May 2021, Plaintiffs filed a notice
of appeal with the Third Circuit. In July 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in the Third Circuit and in
September
                                                        33

2021, Defendants filed their response brief, and in October 2021, Plaintiffs filed their reply brief. In January
2022, the Third Circuit heard oral argument. In September 2022, the Third Circuit affirmed the dismissal of
Plaintiffs’ amended complaint.

A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging
violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,
the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65
warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the
Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be
granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company
moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In
April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a
Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended
complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth
Amended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued
an Order and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February
2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July
2021. The company filed its responsive brief in October 2021. In October 2021, Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy
was filed with the Ninth Circuit. A bankruptcy stay was imposed in December 2021, and the Court held the reply
deadline in abeyance. In February 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order extending the stay. The appeal
continues to be held in abeyance, with the Company being required to file periodic status updates.

In addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc
matters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and
responded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.

Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA, a prescription medication
indicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal
courts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for
the District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in
Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with
respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved many
of the cases and claims in the United States and the costs associated with these settlements are reflected in the
Company’s accruals.

Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated
for the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege
that ELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both
state and federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United
States, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district
litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In addition, cases have been filed
in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen County,
as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been granted mass tort designation. In addition,
three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the
Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The
Company has established accruals for defense costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

Certain subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related
to patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters
involve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain
of the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have
substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no
assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of
these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the
payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated
intangible asset. Significant matters are described below.

(’276) based on Auris’ MONARCH Platform. Auris filed IPR Petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO) regarding the ’056, ’447, ’276 and ’906 patents. In December 2019, the USPTO denied review of the ’056
patent. In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the ’447, and ’906 patents and denied review of
the ’276 patent. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the ’447 and ’906 patents are not
invalid. Auris appealed, and in April 2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the
decision that the ’447 patent was not invalid and remanded the decision to the USPTO for further review. In May
2022, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit confirmed the ruling that claim 53 of the ’906
patent was not invalid, vacated the decision that the remaining claims of the ’906 patent were not invalid and

Pharmaceutical

Litigation Against Filers of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)

The following summarizes lawsuits the Company’s subsidiaries have brought against generic companies that have filed
ANDAs with the U.S. FDA or undertaken similar regulatory processes outside of the United States, seeking to market
generic forms of products sold by various subsidiaries of Johnson & Johnson prior to expiration of the applicable
patents covering those products. These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of
the applicable patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America
Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge
the applicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic
statutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic
companies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their
products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the
applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In
addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can
involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the
relevant patents.

certain of its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in
the United States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has been the basis of government
investigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by,
government agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil
penalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.

Average Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation

Johnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous
other pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts
involving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and
otherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average
Wholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider
reimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid
for any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made
Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions
removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United
States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were
ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.
Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled
after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc.
and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases
have been resolved.

Opioid Litigation

Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along
with other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,
including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active
pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries
were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits
have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following:
individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health
insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI,
have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota,
Texas, Washington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal
court by city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas,
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska,
Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington,
West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan.

Johnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies had also received subpoenas or requests for information
related to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New
Hampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were
contacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a
multi-state Attorney General investigation.

In 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson &
Johnson and JPI in the amount of $ 465million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November
2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and directed entry of judgment for Defendants.
In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with
two counties in Ohio. In April 2021, three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in
California state court against Johnson & Johnson and JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other
pharmaceutical manufacturers. The trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a final
trial judgment in favor of Defendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside and vacate
the judgment was denied. Plaintiffs appealed the judgment, but later filed a request to dismiss the appeal after
electing to participate in the national settlement agreement.

In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $
4billion as settlement of these matters that had not been tried or settled. In October 2020, the Company agreed to
contribute up to an additional $ 1billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed
and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $ 5billion which has been
accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement is not an admission of
liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state
and subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately half of the all-in settlement is expected to be paid by
the end of fiscal year 2022, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The
terms provided a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and,
                                                        40

thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. Based on expected participation,
the Company committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating states (New York,
Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments. By late February 2022, 45 states, five
territories, the District of Columbia, and the vast majority of eligible subdivisions had elected to participate in
the settlement, and the Company confirmed that the level of participation was sufficient to proceed with the
agreement as to all participants. The agreement was effective in April 2022. Also in April 2022, the Company
entered into settlement agreements with the states of Alabama and West Virginia and their participating
subdivisions. In September 2022, the Company also reached a settlement agreement with the State of New Hampshire
and its participating subdivisions. Consequently, by September 2022, the Company had settled the opioid claims
advanced by all states except Washington.

There are approximately 60cases remaining post-settlement in various state courts. There are approximately
860remaining federal cases against Johnson & Johnson and JPI coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation
(MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In addition, the Province of British
Columbia filed suit against Johnson & Johnson and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry
members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other
provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in
Canada against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who
used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust
complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These
actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair
competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust
enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the
plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these
lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive
damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.

In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the
Eastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and
distribution of its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into
manufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act.

From June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand
letters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent
counsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to
the Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or
appropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations
of the independent counsel’s report.

In November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson
as the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court
of New Jersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that
Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative
complaints making similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and
federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February
2022, the state court granted Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that
brought the second case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion
for reconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and
subsequently denied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court’s dismissal order.

In August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson
Services, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office for the
District of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for
the production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the
United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case
filed pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the
District Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied
the qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case
to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District
Court’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a
third amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators’ second amended
complaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for
reconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s
motion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in
December 2021. The relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion for
reconsideration, which the District Court
                                                        41

denied. Following the District Court’s order dismissing the case with prejudice, DePuy filed a December 2021 motion
seeking the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs, which the District Court denied except as to costs. The Relators
have appealed the District Court’s dismissal of the case to the First Circuit. The briefing on the appeal will be
complete by the end of October 2022.

In October 2012, Johnson & Johnson was contacted by the California Attorney General’s office regarding a multi-
state Attorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological
purposes by Johnson & Johnson’s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed
civil complaints against Johnson & Johnson, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer
protection statutes. Similar complaints were filed against the companies by the following states: Kentucky,
Mississippi, West Virginia and Oregon. In April 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the Washington case. In
October 2019, Johnson & Johnson and Ethicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the
District of Columbia. In April 2020, the Company settled the West Virginia case. In October 2020, the Company
settled with the Attorney General of Oregon. In November 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of
Mississippi. Trial in the Kentucky matter is scheduled for May 2023. The California case started trial in July 2019
and concluded in September 2019. In January 2020, the Court in California issued a statement of decision, finding
in favor of the State of California, and awarded civil penalties in the amount of $ 344million. In April 2020, the
Court in California denied the Company’s motion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with
respect to the penalties of $ 344million, but denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The
Company appealed the penalty judgment. In April 2022, the Court of Appeals reduced the judgment to $ 302million,
but otherwise denied the appeal. In July 2022, the Supreme Court of California denied the Company’s petition to
review the Court of Appeals decision, and the Company recorded a charge to reflect the judgment in the second
quarter of 2022. The Company plans to petition for review by the United States Supreme Court.

In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District
of Hinds County, Mississippi against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as
Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi
Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc
contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive
and monetary relief. Johnson & Johnson and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State’s claim
was barred by preemption, which the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted Johnson & Johnson and
JJCI’s request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019.
Briefing and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court rejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021
and remanded the matter to the trial court. In August 2021, JJCI filed a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the
United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Court’s ruling of April 2021. In December 2021 the United
States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari. After the Mississippi Supreme Court remanded the
matter to the trial court, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI objected to any trial setting as barred by the
stay arising from the LTL Bankruptcy Case, referenced above, while the State argued that the stay did not apply. In
January 2022, the Court granted the State’s motion for trial setting and directed the parties to consult with the
Court administrator to secure a trial date. In February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in
February 2023. However, given the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company
and the State agreed to a temporary stay of discovery until May 2022. The temporary stay expired in May 2022. LTL
thereafter moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy
court issued an order staying the case.

In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively
marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the
presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The State of New Mexico filed an Amended Complaint in March 2020. The
Company moved to dismiss certain of the claims in the Amended Complaint, which was granted. The Company then filed
a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in December 2020, which was denied. In March 2022, the New Mexico
court denied the Company’s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and
denied the Company’s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ
of Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New
Mexico’s discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL
Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ
before the New Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin
prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying
the case. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for a stay
pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations.

Forty-two states and the District of Columbia have commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of
its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company.
Five states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The Company has
produced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into confidentiality agreements.
The Company has not received any follow

up requests from those states. In March 2022, each of the forty-two states (including Mississippi and New Mexico)
agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case.

In July 2016, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Products, LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False
Claims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label
promotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA and INTELENCE, and anti-kickback violations in connection with the
promotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments
have declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. The Court denied summary judgment
on all claims in December 2021. Daubert motions were granted in part and denied in part in January 2022, and the
case is proceeding to trial.

In March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department
of Justice regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to
rheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE or SIMPONI ARIA. In August 2019, the United
States Department of Justice notified JBI that it was closing the investigation. Subsequently, the United States
District Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on
the Company. The Department of Justice had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company
filed a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is underway.

In April and September 2017, Johnson & Johnson received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District
of Massachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX,
OLYSIO, REMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA and ZYTIGA. The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer
Price and Best Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services related to those products, as well
as rebate payments to state Medicaid agencies. The Company has provided documents in response to the subpoenas.

In June 2017, Johnson & Johnson received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of
Massachusetts seeking information regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc.
(DePuy) spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of Company subsidiaries
with physicians at these hospitals. Johnson & Johnson and DePuy have produced documents in response to the subpoena
and are fully cooperating with the government’s investigation.

In July 2018, the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust
authority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e
Comércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-
competitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The Company continues to
respond to inquiries regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and
the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

From time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to
produce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate
with these inquiries by producing the requested information.

Agreement for the Company’s COVID-19 vaccine. In July 2022, Emergent filed its answering statement and
counterclaims.

Subsequent to the quarter, in October 2022, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed a Demand for Arbitration against
Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp. with the American Arbitration Association pursuant to the Parties’ agreements relating to
production of drug substance and drug product for Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine. Also in October 2022, Merck
filed its answer and counterclaims.

Beginning in May 2021, multiple putative class actions were filed in state and federal courts (California, Florida,
New York, and New Jersey) against various Johnson & Johnson entities alleging violations of state consumer fraud
statutes based on nondisclosure of alleged benzene contamination of certain Neutrogena and Aveeno sunscreen
products and the affirmative promotion of those products as “safe” ; and, in at least one case, alleging a strict
liability manufacturing defect and failure to warn claims, asserting that the named plaintiffs suffered unspecified
injuries as a result of alleged exposure to benzene. The Judicial Panel on Multi-District Litigation has
consolidated all pending actions, except one product liability case and one case pending in New Jersey state court,
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Fort Lauderdale Division. In October
2021, the Company reached an agreement in principle for the settlement of a nationwide class, encompassing the
claims of the consolidated actions, subject to approval by the Florida federal Court.

Johnson & Johnson (subsequently substituted by Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (JJCI)) along with more than 120
other companies, is a defendant in a cost recovery and contribution action brought by Occidental Chemical
Corporation in June 2018 in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, related to the clean-
up of a section of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey.

Johnson & Johnson or its subsidiaries are also parties to various proceedings brought under the Comprehensive
Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund, and comparable state, local
or foreign laws in which the primary relief sought is the cost of past and/or future remediation.

NOTE 12— RESTRUCTURING

In the fiscal second quarter of 2018 the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its Global
Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities,
technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive
growth. The Global Supply Chain actions will include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering
initiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain
network. In the fiscal third quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $ 123million, which is
included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $ 82million in restructuring, $
13million in cost of products sold and $ 28million in other (income) expense, net. In the fiscal nine months of
2022, the Company recorded a net pre-tax charge of $ 323million, which is included on the following lines of the
Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $ 237million in restructuring, $ 46million in cost of products sold and $
40million in other (income) expense, net. Total project costs of approximately $ 2.1billion have been recorded
since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the restructuring program.

In total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $ 0.7billion to $
0.8billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company
expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $ 2.2billion to $ 2.3billion by the completion of
the program in December 2022. These costs are associated with network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated
depreciation and amortization.
The following table summarizes the severance related reserves and the associated restructuring expenses through the
fiscal third quarter of 2022:

The Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due
to the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing
severance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions
will take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become
probable and estimable.

operational changes

The OTC franchise achieved operational growth of 7.2% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The
growth was driven by price actions and increased Cough/Cold/Flu and pediatric fever incidences as well as category
recovery. This was partially offset by U.S. supply constraints.

The Skin Health/Beauty franchise achieved operational growth of 5.0% as compared to the prior year fiscal third
quarter. The growth was driven by price actions, market growth and increased demand outside the U.S. for NEUTROGENA
and AVEENO due to strong new product introductions.

The Oral Care franchise experienced an operational decline of 0.7% as compared to the prior year fiscal third
quarter. The decline was driven by softer consumption in China, category deceleration in the EMEA and Latin America
regions, and suspension of personal care products in Russia. This was partially offset by price actions in the U.S.

The Baby Care franchise achieved operational growth of 1.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter. The
growth was driven by price actions, market growth and AVEENO Baby facial cream relaunch in the Asia Pacific region.
This was partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.

The Women’s Health franchise achieved operational growth of 7.9% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter
primarily driven by continued strong performance in India, price actions, and lapping prior year supply disruption
due to flooding in EMEA.

The Wound Care/Other franchise experienced an operational decline of 2.5% as compared to the prior year fiscal
third quarter primarily driven by timing of club sales in Canada, U.S. market declines and lapping prior year
strong COVID-19 related demand. This was partially offset by price actions primarily in the U.S.

In November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue as
the name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company.
The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in 18 to 24 months after the initial announcement.

Table of Content

Immunology products achieved operational growth of 5.6% as compared to the same period a year ago driven by market
growth and share gains of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis partially offset by a net
unfavorable adjustment to previous sales reserves. Additionally, strong growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to
market growth and share gains in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis. This was partially offset by lower sales of
REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.

Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United
States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will
result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.

The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September
2023. STELARA (ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product
patent or loss of market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales.

Infectious disease products achieved operational growth of 3.8% as compared to the same period a year ago. Growth
was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially offset by lower sales of
PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of
PREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S.

Neuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 5.9% as compared to the same period a year ago. Growth
of Paliperidone long-acting injectables INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA
was due to new patient starts and persistence of treatment as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA.

Oncology products achieved operational sales growth of 20.0% as compared to the same period a year ago.
Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by share gains in all regions,
continued strong market growth, and uptake of the subcutaneous formulation and the continued global launch uptake
of ERLEADA (apalutamide). IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) sales declined due to competitive pressures.

Pulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 3.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales
growth was due to demand and share gains from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT (macitentan) partially offset by
COVID-19 related market constraints and unfavorable patient mix in OPSUMIT (macitentan) as well as continued
declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.

Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products achieved operational growth of 1.4% as compared to the same period a
year ago. The growth of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) was primarily driven by volume growth and share gains. The decline in
sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) were due to continued share erosion.

Starting in the second quarter of fiscal 2022, the Company updated its policy so that no end customer will be
permitted direct delivery of product to a location other than the billing location. The updated policy impacts
contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject
to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee covered entities can maintain unlimited contract pharmacy
arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all
of its covered outpatient drugs, and it believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate
duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal
government program requiring drug manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to
covered entities. This policy update has discount and volume implications in the current year and going forward.

The Surgery franchise achieved operational sales growth of 7.1% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter.
The operational growth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the following: Endocutter market recovery and
new products partially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.; Biosurgery market recovery, market expansion
efforts and the success of new products partially offset by strong U.S. market demand in the prior year for
infection prevention products; and Energy products driven by new product penetration coupled with competitive
supply challenges partially offset by competitive pressures. The operational growth in General Surgery was
primarily driven by market recovery and technology penetration.

The Orthopaedics franchise achieved operational sales growth of 4.7% as compared to the prior year fiscal third
quarter. The operational growth in hips reflects procedure recovery, continued strength from the portfolio
including ACTIS Stem and PINNACLE Dual Mobility, driven by KINCISE and VELYS Hip Navigation and momentum in the
U.S. Ambulatory Surgery Center channel. This was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China
and the timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in knees was primarily driven by procedure
recovery, strength of the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution. This
was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and timing of tenders outside the U.S. The
operational growth in Trauma was driven by market recovery and the uptake of new products. The operational growth
in Spine, Sports & Other reflects procedure recovery and the benefit from new products in Spine, Sports, Shoulders
and VELYS Digital Solutions. This was partially offset by competitive pressures in Spine.

The Vision franchise achieved operational sales growth of 8.6% as compared to the prior year fiscal third quarter.
The Contact Lenses/Other operational growth was primarily driven by market recovery, price actions, commercial
execution and

new products as well as the benefit of stocking in the U.S. related to new product launches. The Surgical
operational growth was primarily driven by the success of new products mostly offset by global supply challenges, a
high prior year comparison in Refractive lenses and timing of stocking in ASPAC.

The Interventional Solutions franchise achieved operational sales growth of 17.7% as compared to the prior year
fiscal third quarter. The double digit growth in all regions was driven by continued market recovery, new product
performance

and commercial execution.

The Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal nine months of 2022 was 20.4%
versus 10.0% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in the
fiscal nine months of 2022 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:

• Lower litigation expense, primarily talc ($0.1 billion in 2022 vs. $1.5 billion in 2021)

• Supply chain benefits in 2022

partially offset by

• Commodity inflation in 2022

The Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal nine months of 2022 was 32.0%
versus 36.5% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the
fiscal nine months of 2022 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:

• An IPR&D charge of $0.6 billion in 2022 related to bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the
treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)

• Divestiture gains of $0.6 billion in 2021, primarily related to divestiture gains of two pharmaceutical brands
outside the U.S.

• Unfavorable changes in the fair value of securities ($0.7 billion loss in 2022 vs. $0.2 billion gain in 2021)

• COVID-19 Vaccine supply network related costs of $0.7 billion in 2022

• Increased Research & Development investment for general portfolio progression

• Unfavorable currency in Cost of Products Sold

partially offset by

• Litigation related expense of $0.7 billion in 2021, primarily related to Risperdal Gynecomastia

• Lower intangible asset amortization expense ($2.2 billion in 2022 vs. $2.5 billion in 2021)

The MedTech segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal nine months of 2022 was 18.1% versus
18.8% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal
nine months of 2022 was primarily driven by the following:

• Higher litigation related expense ($0.5 billion in 2022 vs. income of $0.1 billion in 2021)

• Commodity inflation in 2022

• Increased selling, marketing and administrative spending to support product launches

• Increased investment in Research & Development

The Consumer Health segment income (loss) before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal third quarter of 2022 was
21.3% versus (15.1)% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales in
the fiscal third quarter of 2022 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:

• Lower litigation expense primarily talc

• Supply chain benefits in 2022

partially offset by

• Commodity inflation in 2022

The Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal third quarter of 2022 was 32.2%
versus 32.6% for the same period a year ago. The decrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the
fiscal third quarter as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:

• Unfavorable changes in the fair value of securities ($0.2 billion loss in 2022 vs. $0.1 billion gain in 2021)

• COVID-19 Vaccine supply network related costs of $0.4 billion in 2022

• Unfavorable currency in Cost of Products Sold

• Increased Research & Development investment for general portfolio progression

growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations,
and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and
optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant
consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate

of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.2 to $2.3 billion by the
completion of the program in December 2022. In the first fiscal nine months of 2022, the Company recorded a net

The Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the Company
secured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which
expires on September 7, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either
Term Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rates as allowed under the
terms of the agreement, plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.

As of October 2, 2022, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately $34.1
billion and approximately $32.0 billion of notes payable and long-term debt for a net cash position of $2.1 billion
as compared to the prior year net debt position of $2.9 billion. Considering recent market conditions and the on-
going COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not
foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise
funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the
commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the
Company's approximate $0.5 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the
COVID-19 vaccine, the remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately
$2.8 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 11 to the
Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital
markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.

On September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program,
authorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock. Share repurchases may be made
at management’s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The
repurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares
acquired will be available for general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase
program through available cash. Through September 30, 2022, $2.0 billion has been repurchased under the program.

In the fiscal nine months of 2022, the Company paid approximately $2.1 billion to the U.S. Treasury which included
$0.8 billion related to the current installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge
(see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended January 2, 2022) and $1.3 billion primarily related to the normal estimated payments for the fiscal nine
months of 2022.

During the fiscal third quarter ended October 2, 2022, the Company sold all of its shares in argenx SE for proceeds
of $0.6 billion.

Dividends

On July 18, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.13 per share, payable on September

Economic and Market Factors

COVID-19 considerations and business continuity

The Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on
its business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:

• Operating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility
designed into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.

• Supply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities
while closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas
to ensure adequate and effective distribution.

• Business Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been
instrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and
consumer needs remains uninterrupted.
                                                        63

• Workforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing,
distribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been
established for other employees.

• Liquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital
markets for the foreseeable future.

• Domestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global
legislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently,
the recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations.

In fiscal 2021 and 2020, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine
production with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with
future supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such
production if capacity is not required. In the fiscal third quarter of 2022, amounts paid for services to be
delivered and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately
$0.5 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other and the accrued liabilities accounts in the Company's
consolidated balance sheet. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing
arrangements with government related organizations.

Based on the global progress on vaccine development and distribution as well as the amount of existing global
supply, the Company is modifying its COVID-19 vaccine research programs and manufacturing capacity to levels that
meet all customer contractual commitments which will result in incremental costs for the year. The Company
continues to evaluate the global demand for the COVID-19 vaccine and its related supply.

The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements. The Company has
established a global vaccine supply network, where, in addition to its internal manufacturing site in Leiden, the
Netherlands, ten other manufacturing sites have been involved in the production of the vaccine across different
countries and continents. The Company does not believe that a disruption relating to vaccine manufacturing, or the
resulting delay would have a material financial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or
results.

Russia-Ukraine War

Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the
financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal third quarter and nine months of 2022, including accounts receivable
or inventory reserves, was not material. As of both the 2021 fiscal year ending January 2, 2022, and the fiscal
third quarter ending October 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Ukraine subsidiaries represented less than 1%
of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the 2021 fiscal year ending January 2, 2022, and the
fiscal third quarter ending October 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less
than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues.

In early March, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any
additional investment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March, the Company made the decision to suspend supply
of personal care products in Russia. The Company continued to supply its other products throughout the third
quarter as patients rely on many of the products for healthcare purposes.

The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.
The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency
exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company
operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela and Argentina as highly inflationary, as the prior
three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company
accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate
surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact on the Company's results in the period. In the face of
increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity
improvements and periodic price increases.

Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing
or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are
required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater
audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in
the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the
period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the
countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or
benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.
                                                        64

The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that
include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of
health care products.

Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying
medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing
healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the
Company’s businesses.

The Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed
Abbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise
challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of
many of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those
products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting
lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in
the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-
cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could
launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or
more valid patents are in place.

Item 3 — QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

There has been no material change in the Company’s assessment of its sensitivity to market risk since its
presentation set forth in Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk,” in its Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022.

Item 4 — CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief
Executive Officer; Chairman, Executive Committee and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

Internal control. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not experienced any material impact to its
internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of its employees are working remotely due to
the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate and refine its financial reporting
process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance that the financial results are
reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and
operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.
