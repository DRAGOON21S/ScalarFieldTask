          "content": "BUSINESS\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. Johnson &\nJohnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world.\nThe Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated\nin the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Company's three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer), Pharmaceutical and\nMedical Devices. Within the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and\ninternational operating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations\nof those companies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents\nof the country where located.\nSegments of Business\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices.\nAdditional information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular\ndescriptions of segments and operating results under: “Item 7.

Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other\ncompanies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.\nMedical Devices\nThe Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics,\nSurgery, and Vision fields. Medical Devices in Interventional Solutions include Electrophysiology products\n(Biosense Webster) to treat cardiovascular diseases, Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that treats hemorrhagic and\nischemic stroke; the Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) is comprised of products in support of Hips, Knees,\nTrauma, and Spine, Sports & Other; the Surgery portfolios (Ethicon) include advanced and general surgery offerings,\nsolutions that focus on Breast Aesthetics (Mentor) and Ear, Nose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures; and Johnson &\nJohnson Vision products such as ACUVUE ® Brand disposable contact lenses and ophthalmic products related to\ncataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and\nused predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nGeographic Areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 134,500 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of\nBusiness – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products\nand methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold\nin international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other\nintellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n2\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.3% of the Company's\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the\nCompany. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related\nto STELARA ®. The latest expiring United States patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring European patent expires\nin 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO™ (daratumumab and\nhyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 5.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2020.\nAccordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns\npatents related to DARZALEX ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The latest\nexpiring licensed United States patent expires in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent expires in\n2031. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO™.\nSales of the Company’s third largest product, IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib), accounted for approximately 5.0% of the\nCompany's total revenues for fiscal 2020. Accordingly, patents related to this product are believed to be material\nto the Company. Pharmacyclics LLC (an AbbVie company) owns the patents related to IMBRUVICA ® , and Janssen\nBiotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patents. The Pharmacyclics patents and their expiration dates are\nlisted in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book). Pharmacyclics LLC and\nJanssen Biotech, Inc. have entered into confidential settlement agreements with certain generic companies granting\nlicenses to market their generic ibrutinib products in the United States before the expiration of certain patents.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the\nfourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for\nadvertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the\nCompany’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company\nbelieves that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company’s compliance with these requirements did not change during the past year, and is not expected to have a\nmaterial effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state\nagencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The\nexercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in\nincreases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a\ncorresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets\noutside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in\nother countries are examples of such increased regulation.\n3\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or\nmedical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain\nor seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products,\nrefuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for\nexports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks\nof substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our\nofficers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain\nconduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the US Department\nof Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing\nand selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result in a\nsubstantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in\ndifferent countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human health care have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write\nprescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and\nregulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in\nthe healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare\ncompanies and health care providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and\nother transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to\ncertain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require\nstrict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign\ngovernment official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being\npaid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs\nof health care generally.\nU.S. government agencies continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual\nmandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid\nexpansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not\noffering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being\nchallenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to\njudicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar , which challenges the\nconstitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to\nbuy health insurance remains in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the\nMedicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of\nthe benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the\nstate level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape\nhas both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how\nvarious provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry.\nIn addition, business practices in the health care industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nare subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit, that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the\nCompany's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\nThe global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and\nglobal economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many\nchallenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of\nregulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and\ndevices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.\n4\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, the number of employees were approximately:\n2020       2019\nEmployees1                               136,400    133,200\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2    134,500    132,200\n1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and\ninclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed\nboth professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and Employee Engagement\nAt Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to\npatients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees\nworldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements for business\nconduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide\nadditional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company c onducts global\nsurveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential\nhuman resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2020, 93% of global employees across 78 countries\nparticipated in Our Credo Survey which is offered in 36 languages.\nGrowth and Development\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and\nretain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and\nbe provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs\nand educational resources\n5\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each\nperson’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term\nstrategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for\neveryone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2020, 44.6% of employees in Manager and above\njob categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines\n(including upward promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development\norganizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 5.2%.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity\nand inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's\ncontinued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI strategy focuses\non three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the challenges\nand opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity:\nAccelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation\nBuild a diverse workforce for the future\nEnhance business results and reputation\nThe Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\nemployee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same\neverywhere.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and\nbenefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where\npossible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' financial,\nphysical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement\nsavings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee\nassistance programs.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors\nto the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs\nthroughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings\nbest-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal mind and body health goals. The programs and practices\nthe Company advances covers three core dimensions: Healthy Eating, Healthy Movement and Healthy Mind.\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com.

          "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company's control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development.\nFor the Company’s pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and\nenter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the\nCompany’s medical device businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are\nespecially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and\ntechnologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\nobsolete. The Company’s consumer health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and\nretailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name\nconsumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company's subsidiaries operate 90 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nhundreds of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other severe weather\nevents, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and\ndifficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact as well as\nsignificant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party\nmanufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third party\nmanufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce\nproducts of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a\ntimely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be\nable to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an\nadverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties, including the Company’s strategic partnership with Jabil\nin the Medical Devices segment, to manufacture these products include reliance on the third party for regulatory\ncompliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual property, limited ability to\nmanage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possible\ntermination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or\ninconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third party manufacturers suffer any damage to facilities, lose\nbenefits under material agreements, experience power outages, encounter financial difficulties, are unable to\nsecure necessary raw materials from their suppliers or suffer any other reduction in efficiency, the Company may\n7\nexperience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need to seek and\nsource other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased costs which\ncould affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry's failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions\nor future impact to the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises and pandemics, including the global outbreak of the\nnovel coronavirus and its mutations (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected to\ncontinue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of\nCOVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the\nCompany's employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as\nthe Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The\nCompany continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our\nglobal supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our\nbusiness from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19\nwill impact the Company's future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence,\nincluding the duration of the outbreak . Any resurgence in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of\nnew mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the disease. The\ncontinued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company's operations, including, among other things,\nour manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and clinical trial\noperations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company's business, financial results, and global\neconomic conditions generally.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our efforts to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate, including uncertainties\nrelated to the risk that our development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval or\nEmergency Use Authorization from regulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial data, including\nfurther analyses of existing preclinical or clinical trial data that may be inconsistent with the data used for\nselection of the JNJ-78436735 vaccine candidate and dose level for the Phase 3 (ENSEMBLE) trial; the risk that\nclinical trial data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer\nreview/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by regulatory authorities; disruptions in\nthe relationships between us, our third-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies\nmay produce superior or competitive products; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer\nexist; risks related to the availability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may\nnot be able to recoup costs associated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes\nin the way we approach or provide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19;\nthe risk that we may not be able to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may\nexperience manufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply\nchannels commensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would\nnegatively impact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine candidate within the\nprojected time periods indicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine\ndevelopment program; and pricing and access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also\nhave the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section and those\nincorporated by reference herein, i ncluding risks relating to the Company’s effective tax rate as a result of\nchanges in consumption as well as changes in\n8\nlaws relating to supply of the Company’s products . Given that developments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have\nbeen constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise, including litigation, that are not presently\nknown to the Company.\nRisk Related to the Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare\nreforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s pharmaceutical and medical device products are significantly affected by reimbursements by\nthird-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations.\nAs part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at\nwhich products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among health care\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in\nadditional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom and Japan,\nhave pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose\nprice controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its\nintellectual property protection.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as patent disputes, product liability and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company's more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSONS ® Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes\nit has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The\nCompany could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these\nmatters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally\nliable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any\nreporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for\nthat period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however the Company utilizes a\nwholly-owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\nwhether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other\ncountries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage.\nThese circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s\nproducts. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and\ninspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines,\nsignificant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and\nlegal action, by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which they\noperate. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable\nquality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to\nfines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product\napprovals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to\nregulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid\nRebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection\nlaws. Scrutiny of health care industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the\nU.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties\nincluding, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant\ncurrent investigations and\n9\nlitigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings-Government Proceedings”\nunder Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and\nresults of operations. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the\nCompany’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the\nnew tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it\noperates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may\nbe material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nSee Note 8 on income taxes for additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with the 2015 Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development Base\nErosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities\non operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. The\nCompany regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and disputes to determine the appropriateness of\nits tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on tax treatment that is contrary to the\nCompany’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of reserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company may not be able to successfully secure and defend intellectual property rights essential to the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights, relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of\nthird parties could result in the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely affect the\ncompetitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products\nmay challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA, process with the FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and\nInnovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the FDA of\nbiosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk”\nlaunch (despite pending patent infringement litigation) by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the\nCompany can lose a major portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current\nlegal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19,\n“Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8\nof this Report.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and\nindications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\n10\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving health care needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing\nproducts lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products\nintroduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2020 sales. The Company cannot be certain\nwhen or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies,\nwhether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products\nwill be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to discern patients’ and health care providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers\nor uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product\ncan be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\nmarket entry of competitive products.\nRisk Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally .\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity outside the U.S. are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2020, approximately 48% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 23% in Europe, 7% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina (beginning in\nthe fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative\ninflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost\nreduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as\na result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high\ninflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the health care providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;\n11\ntherefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the\nFCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company\noperates have laws and regulations, including the U.K Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt\nand anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional\nadministrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal\nsanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from health care programs.\nOther Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally include:\nprotective economic policies taken by governments such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing\nrequirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing\ncosts and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\nworkforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important\nto our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective\ntransfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal technology (IT) systems and networks, and those of\nthird parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research, business\nplans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal protection, and\nensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and cybersecurity threats,\nwhich affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks, and\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company continually assesses\nthese threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities, as well\nas ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this risk . To\ndate, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or operations resulting from information\nor cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased\nvolume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This\nimpact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and\n12\nregulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information security or cyber\nincident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or reputational\nlosses.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition",

The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer),\nPharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby\ncare, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These\nproducts are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors\nthroughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology,\ninfectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\nProducts in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care\nprofessionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the\northopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields. These\nproducts are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields\nby physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.\nIn all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the\nworld. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies\ninvolved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and\nprocesses, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the\nunderlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all\nareas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In\naddition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves\nsignificant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nManagement’s Objectives\nWith “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly\nchange the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to\nensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is\npoised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it\ncompetes.\nThe Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high\nquality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for\napproximately 25% of 2020 sales. In 2020, $12.2 billion was invested in research and development and $7.3 billion\nspent on acquisitions, reflecting management’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value\nthrough partnerships that will profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\nA critical driver of the Company’s success is the 134,500 diverse employees worldwide. Employees are empowered and\ninspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the\nCompany’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging\nthe extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence. This\nensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and invest for an\nenduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals, employees,\ncommunities and shareholders.\n19\nResults of Operations\nAnalysis of Consolidated Sales\nFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2019 and 2018 see\nthe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019, Item 7. Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIn 2020, worldwide sales increased 0.6% to $82.6 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2019. These sales\nchanges consisted of the following:\nSales increase/(decrease) due to:    2020       2019\nVolume                                3.5  %     3.7  %\nPrice                                -2.3       -0.9\nCurrency                             -0.6       -2.2\nTotal                                 0.6  %     0.6  %\nThe net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020\nand a negative impact of 1.7% in 2019.\nSales by U.S. companies were $43.1 billion in 2020 and $42.1 billion in 2019. This represents increases of 2.5% in\n2020 and 0.5% in 2019. Sales by international companies were $39.5 billion in 2020 and $40.0 billion in 2019. This\nrepresents a decrease of 1.3% in 2020 and an increase of 0.7% in 2019.\nThe five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.3%, 3.9% and 2.8%,\nrespectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.0%, 3.9%\nand 2.1%, respectively.\nIn 2020, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 2.8% as compared to the prior year, which included\noperational growth of 2.0% and a positive currency impact of 0.8%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere\n(excluding the U.S.) experienced a sales decline of 10.2% as compared to the prior year, which included operational\ngrowth of 0.4% offset by a negative currency impact of 10.6%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region\nexperienced a sales decline of 2.7% as compared to the prior year, including an operational decline of 3.1%\npartially offset by a positive currency impact of 0.4%.\nThe 2020 results benefited from the inclusion of a 53rd week. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nfor Annual Closing Date details). The Company estimated that the fiscal year 2020 sales growth rate was enhanced by\napproximately 1.0%. While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's worth of\noperating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.\nIn 2020, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented\napproximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2019, the Company had three wholesalers\ndistributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 15.0%, 12.0% and 11.0% of the total\nconsolidated revenues.\nNote: values may have been rounded\n20\nAnalysis of Sales by Business Segments\nConsumer Health Segment\nConsumer Health segment sales in 2020 were $14.1 billion, an increase of 1.1% from 2019, which included 3.0%\noperational growth and a negative currency impact of 1.9%. U.S. Consumer Health segment sales were $6.4 billion, an\nincrease of 9.0%. International sales were $7.7 billion, a decrease of 4.6%, which included an operational decline\nof 1.3% and a negative currency impact of 3.3%.

Growth was primarily\nattributable to sales from TYLENOL ® driven by COVID-19 stocking demand, ZYRTEC ® due to competitor product out of\nstock and PEPCID ® due to competitive product withdrawal both in the U.S., and increased consumption in anti-\nsmoking aids. International sales were negatively impacted by COVID-19 and low incidence of cough and flu.\nThe Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales were $4.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 3.1% as compared to the prior year.\nThe decline was primarily due to negative COVID-19 related impacts and SKU rationalization partially offset by\ngrowth in eCommerce and new product innovation.\nThe Oral Care franchise sales of $1.6 billion increased 7.4% as compared to the prior year primarily attributable\nto sales of LISTERINE ® mouthwash due to U.S. eCommerce and club channel growth, increased stocking demand related\nto COVID-19 and new product launches in Asia Pacific.\nThe Baby Care franchise sales were $1.5 billion in 2020, a decrease of 9.4% compared to the prior year. The decline\nwas primarily due to COVID-19 related impacts, SKU rationalization and the Baby Center divestiture in the U.S.\npartially offset by strength in AVEENO ® baby.\nThe Women’s Health franchise sales were $0.9 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.6% as compared to the prior year. The\ndecline was primarily driven by COVID-19 impacts.\nThe Wound Care/Other franchise sales were $0.7 billion in 2020, an increase of 7.2% as compared to the prior year.\nGrowth was due to strong performance of NEOSPORIN ® and BAND-AID ® Brand Adhesive Bandages and COVID-19 related\ndemand in the Asia Pacific region.\n21\nPharmaceutical Segment\nPharmaceutical segment sales in 2020 were $45.6 billion, an increase of 8.0% from 2019, which included operational\ngrowth of 8.2% and a negative currency impact of 0.2%.

This was partially offset by COVID-19 related demand and lower sales of\nREMICADE ® (infliximab) due to increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition.\nThe patents for REMICADE ® (infliximab) in certain countries in Europe expired in February 2015. Biosimilar\nversions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in certain markets outside the United States, resulting in a reduction\nin sales of REMICADE ® in those markets. Additional biosimilar competition will likely result in a further\nreduction in sales of REMICADE ® in markets outside the United States. In the United States, a biosimilar version\nof REMICADE ® was introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab\nbiosimilar competition in the U.S. market will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of REMICADE ® .\nInfectious disease products sales were $3.6 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 4.7% as compared to the\nprior year primarily due to strong sales of SYMTUZA ® and JULUCA ® . This was partially offset by lower sales of\nPREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in\ncertain countries outside the U.S.\nNeuroscience products sales were $6.5 billion, representing an increase of 3.5% as compared to the prior year.\nPaliperidone long-acting injectables growth driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone\npalmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® from new patient starts and persistence. The growth was partially offset\nby migration from RISPERDAL CONSTA ® (risperidone) and declines in CONCERTA ® (methylphenidate) due to competitive\nentrants.\nOncology products achieved sales of $12.4 billion in 2020, representing an increase of 15.7% as compared to the\nprior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) driven by patient uptake in\nall lines of therapy and the launch of a subcutaneous formulation in the U.S. and E.U.; IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) due\nto market growth globally and maintaining strong share and the continued global launch uptake and share gains of\nERLEADA ® (apalutamide). Additionally, the growth was negatively impacted by declining sales of ZYTIGA ®\n(abiraterone acetate) and VELCADE ® (bortezomib) due to generic competition.\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.1 billion, representing an increase of 20.0% as compared to\nthe prior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains\nand market growth. Additionally, sales of TRACLEER ® (bosentan) were negatively impacted by generics and migration\nto OPSUMIT ® .\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.9 billion, a decline of 6.0% as compared to the prior year.\nSales growth of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) were due to market growth and favorable channel mix\ndynamics in the U.S. and strength in the European region partially offset by U.S. share declines due to competitive\npressures. The growth of XARELTO ® (rivaroxaban) was due to demand growth partially offset by higher rebates.

The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of\nstrategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness,\nenhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and\nare subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects\nthese actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be\nsubstantially delivered by 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $1.9\nto $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash\noutlays. In 2020, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion, which is included on the following lines\nof the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.2 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense\nand $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.3 billion have been recorded\nsince the restructuring was announced.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 10.8% in 2020 and 12.7% in 2019. During\nthe fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the\nrequirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion\nin the fiscal year 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional\npre-tax $1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2020 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity & Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.0 billion at the end of 2020 as compared to $17.3 billion at the end of 2019.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $3.3 billion decrease were:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$                   17.3    Q4 2019 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n23.5    cash generated from operating activities\n-20.8    net cash used by investing activities\n-6.1    net cash used by financing activities\n0.1    effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$                   14.0    Q4 2020 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $11.2 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2020 and $2.0 billion\nat the end of fiscal year 2019.

As of January 3, 2021, the net debt position was $10.1 billion as compared to the prior year\nof $8.4 billion. There was an increase in the net debt position due to increased borrowings in the fiscal third\nquarter of 2020. The debt balance at the end of 2020 was $35.3 billion as compared to $27.7 billion in 2019.\nConsidering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19 crisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash\nflows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that\noperating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed\ncredit facilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund\noperating needs, including the talc litigation and agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation of which the\nmajority may be paid over the next two to three years. In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets\non an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. In the fiscal\n30\nthird quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0 billion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8\nbillion outstanding at year end. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for\na total of $7.5 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition which closed on\nOctober 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes . Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA),\nthe Company has access to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nJanuary 3, 2021: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\nTax Legislation                             Interest on\n(Dollars in Millions)                (TCJA)    Debt Obligations    Debt Obligations     Total\n2021                     $              812               1,799                 949     3,560\n2022                                    812               2,226                 908     3,946\n2023                                  1,522               1,552                 880     3,954\n2024                                  2,029               1,598                 842     4,469\n2025                                  2,536               1,744                 789     5,069\nAfter 2025                                —              25,515               9,503    35,018\nTotal                    $            7,711              34,434              13,871    56,016\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related\nto business combinations or the Company’s approximate $0.9 billion in contractual supply commitments associated\nwith its development of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $121 million. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 3,\n2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $148 million. In either\nscenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1,667 million. In either scenario,\nat maturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $36 million.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2020, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which\nexpires on September 9, 2021. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either\nbids provided by banks, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Swap Curve\nor other applicable market\nrate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\n31\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2020 and 2019 were $35.3 billion and $27.7 billion, respectively. The increase in\nborrowings was the issuance of notes in 2020 when market conditions were favorable. In 2020, net debt (cash and\ncurrent marketable securities, net of debt) was $10.1 billion compared to net debt of $8.4 billion in 2019. Total\ndebt represented 35.8% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2020 and 31.8% of total capital in\n2019. Shareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2020 was $24.04 compared to $22.59 at year-end 2019.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2020 for the 58th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $3.98 per share\nin 2020 and $3.75 per share in 2019.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.01 per share, payable on March 9,\n2021 to shareholders of record as of February 23, 2021.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving\nfactors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact\nworldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the\nspeed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed\ncertain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with\nthe information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3,\n2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the\nCompany’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and\nassociated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a\nmaterial impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 3, 2021,\nthe Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result\nin material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as\nvariable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily\nthrough the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as\ninternally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the\nfiscal years 2020 and 2019.\n32\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share\npayments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29,\n2019.\nConsumer Health Segment\n(Dollars in Millions)                        Balance at                                           Balance at\n2020                                Beginning of

Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation\nwould be approximately $0.7 billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange\nrates.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2021, the Internal Revenue Service published final regulations addressing the\nrequirements for tax deductibility of settlement payments. The Company recorded a pre-tax reserve for $4.0 billion\nin fiscal 2019 based on the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation and recorded an additional pre-tax\n$1.0 billion in the fiscal third quarter of 2020 upon which an effective rate of 21.4% has been applied.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealth care cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market\nvalue was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted\noperational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance\nshare units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted\noperational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share\ngoal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at\nthe time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the\nvesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was\nestimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 3, 2021.\n35\nEconomic and Market Factors\nCOVID-19 considerations and business continuity\nThe Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on\nits business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:\nOperating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility\ndesigned into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.\nSupply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities\nwhile closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas\nto ensure adequate and effective distribution.\nBusiness Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been\ninstrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and\nconsumer needs remains uninterrupted.\nWorkforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing,\ndistribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been\nestablished for other employees.\nLiquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital\nmarkets for the foreseeable future. In the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued approximately $5.0\nbillion of commercial paper, with approximately $0.8 billion outstanding at year end, for additional liquidity.\nAdditionally, in the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $7.5\nbillion. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. acquisition on\nOctober 1, 2020 and for general corporate purposes.\nDomestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global\nlegislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently,\nthe recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations.\nIn fiscal 2020, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine production\nwith third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with future\nsupplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if\ncapacity is not required. Amounts paid and contractually obligated to be paid to these contract manufacturing\norganizations of approximately $0.9 billion are reflected in the prepaid expenses and other, other assets, accrued\nliabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated balance sheet upon execution of each\nagreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine development cost sharing arrangements with\ngovernment related organizations.\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of health care. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2010 - 2020, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for health care\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina (beginning in the fiscal third quarter of 2018) and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as\nthe prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's\nresults in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through\ncost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nIn June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union\n(E.U.), commonly referred to as “Brexit”. The U.K. officially exited the E.U. on January 31, 2020, however, there\nwas a transition period to allow time to agree the terms of a new trade deal. On December 30, 2020, the U.K., E.U.\nand the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) signed the EU–UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Over the\nlast few years, Brexit has created global political and economic uncertainty and has led to volatility in exchange\nrates and interest rates, additional cost containment by third-party payors and changes in regulations. While the\nUK and EU have now agreed on a future trade and cooperation agreement, it is still unclear what the ultimate\nfinancial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the E.U. will have. However,\nthe Company currently does not believe that these and other related effects will have a material impact on the\nCompany’s consolidated financial position or operating results. As of January 3, 2021, the business of the\nCompany’s U.K. subsidiaries represented less than 6% of the Company’s consolidated assets and less than 3% of the\nCompany's fiscal twelve months revenues.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2020 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $384 million and net income by approximately $115\nmillion.\n36\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the\nrevaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealth care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of health care products and services, including\ndelaying medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and\nforegoing health care insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to\nimpact the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial and other matters; governmental investigations; and other legal\nproceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is\ndetermined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding legal proceedings.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 16, 2021,\nthere were 132,376 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.",

Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated.Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately 134,500employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the health care field. The Company conducts business in virtually all\ncountries of the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into threebusiness segments: Consumer Health (previously referred to as Consumer),\nPharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The Consumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the baby\ncare, oral care, skin health/beauty, over-the-counter pharmaceutical, women’s health and wound care markets. These\nproducts are marketed to the general public and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors\nthroughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including immunology,\ninfectious diseases, neuroscience, oncology, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiovascular and metabolic diseases.\nProducts in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, hospitals and health care\nprofessionals for prescription use. The Medical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the\northopaedic, surgery, interventional solutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and eye health fields, which are\ndistributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians,\nnurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nASU 2018-18: Collaborative Arrangements\nThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update clarifies the\ninteraction between ASC 808, Collaborative Arrangements and ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The\nupdate clarifies that certain transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement should be accounted\nfor under ASC 606 when the counterparty is a customer. In addition, the update precludes an entity from presenting\nconsideration from a transaction in a collaborative arrangement as revenue if the counterparty is not a customer\nfor that transaction. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated\nfinancial statements.\nASU 2016-13: Financial Instruments - Credit Losses\nThe Company adopted this standard as of the beginning of the fiscal year 2020. This update introduces the current\nexpected credit loss (CECL) model, which requires an entity to measure credit losses for certain financial\ninstruments and financial assets, including trade receivables. Under this update, on initial recognition and at\neach reporting period, an entity is required to recognize an allowance that reflects the entity’s current estimate\nof credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the financial instrument. The adoption of this standard\ndid not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\nASU 2018-14: Compensation - Defined Benefit Plans\nThe Company adopted this standard in the fiscal year ended 2020. This standard revised the financial statement note\ndisclosure requirements of ASC 715-20 for defined benefit plan sponsors. The adoption of this standard had no\nimpact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\ndefined benefit plan disclosures.\n45\nAccounting Standards adopted in the fiscal 2018 with a cumulative effect to the 2018 opening balance of Retained\nEarnings\nThe following table summarizes the cumulative effect adjustments made to the 2018 opening balance of retained\nearnings upon adoption of these accounting standards in 2018:\nCumulative Effect Adjustment Increase (Decrease) to\n(Dollars in Millions)                                                            Retained Earnings\nASU 2014-09 - Revenue from Contracts        $                                                  -47\nwith Customers\nASU 2016-01 - Financial Instruments                                                            232\nASU 2016-16 - Income Taxes: Intra-Entity                                                      -439\nTransfers\nTotal                                       $                                                 -254\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 3, 2021\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any,\nfrom the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2019. There were no new\nmaterial accounting standards issued in fiscal 2020 that impacted the Company.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAvailable-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are\nclassified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity\nsecurities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company\nreviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nBuilding and building equipment    20-30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between\n46\nthe asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the Company will estimate\nfair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as variable consideration and\nrecorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on\nthe consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the\nCompany's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nwhich amounted to $ 7.2billion and $ 7.0billion as of January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler\nand other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each\nof the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share\npayments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.0billion, $ 1.0billion and $ 1.1billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019\nand 2018, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2020 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\nPurchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the\nunderlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived\nintangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\n47\nFinancial Instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-\nbased measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,\nexclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 1.0billion and $ 1.0billion in 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The lease liability was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The operating\nlease costs were $ 0.3billion, $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Cash paid for\namounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion in 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when\nthose costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development.\n48\nAmounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of\nresearch and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the\nCompany’s operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n*    Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful\nlife.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO ® , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA ® , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX ® ,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses.Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and Internet\nadvertising, were $ 2.1billion, $ 2.2billion and $ 2.6billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings\nin the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate\nof 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will\ncontinue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2020 was approximately $ 7.7billion, of which $\n6.9billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet.\nThe balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next\n12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). In 2018, the Company elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company\n49\nintends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the Company decides at a later\ndate to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide for the net tax effects on\nthese amounts. The Company estimates that the total tax effect of this repatriation would be approximately $\n0.7billion under current enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving\nfactors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact\nworldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the\nspeed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed\ncertain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with\nthe information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 3,\n2021 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the\nCompany’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and\nassociated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a\nmaterial impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 3,\n2021, the Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could\nresult in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nAnnual Closing Date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n50\n2.

The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of January 3, 2021, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted\nto $ 1.1billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors\ncounter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company\nprimarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.\nRefer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 3, 2021, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, and cross currency interest rate swaps of $\n37.8billion and $ 30.6billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2019, the Company had notional amounts outstanding\nfor forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate swaps of $ 45.3billion and $ 20.1billion,\nrespectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. The effect of which\nare immaterial for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019. Gains and losses on net investment\nhedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive income. The\nportion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the spot method. On\nan ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in offsetting\nchanges of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge accounting is\ndiscontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a\nnet investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as\ntheir functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of January 3, 2021, the balance of deferred net gain on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 652million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts, net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings may\ndiffer as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange\nrates at maturity of the derivative.\n54\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, net of tax:\nJanua…                                             Decem…\n3,                                                29,\n2021                                               2019\n(Dol…                   Cost              Inter…      Other              Cost of              Intere…     Other\nin           Sales        of       R&D    (Inco…    (Incom…     Sales    Produc…       R&D    (Incom…    (Inco…\nMill…                 Produ…    Expen…    Expen…    Expense                 Sold    Expen…    Expense    Expen…\nSold\nThe\neffe…\nof\nfair\nvalu…\nnet\ninve…\nand\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nnet\ninve…\nhedg…\nrela…\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…\nreco…\nin\ninco…    $       —         —         —       153          —         —          —         —        159         —\non\nderi…\namou…\nexcl…\nfrom\neffe…\ntest…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor               —         —         —       153          —         —          —         —        159         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nGain\n(Los…\non\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nrela…\nForw…\nfore…\nexch…\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…           12      -329      -137         —        -16       -54       -321      -105          —        22\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor              44       298      -191         —        -52       -20       -606       -94          —        39\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…            —         —         —       370          —         —          —         —        292         —\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor       $       —         —         —       748          —         —          —         —        417         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nThe following table is the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instrument for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019:\nGain/(Loss)\n(Dollars in Millions)            Location of Gain /(Loss)                    Recognized In\nDerivatives Not Designated as    Recognized in Income                 Income on Derivative\nHedging Instruments              on Derivative                             January 3, 2021    December 29, 2019\nForeign Exchange Contracts       Other (income) expense            $                    24                 -144\n55\nThe following table is the effect of net investment hedges for the fiscal years ended January 3, 2021 and December\n29, 2019:\nLocation of\nGain or (Loss)\nReclassified\nfrom               Gain/(Loss)\nAccumulated        Reclassified\nGain/(Loss)                       Other              From\nRecognized In                       Comprehensive      Accumulated OCI\n(Dollars in          Accumulated OCI       December 29,    Income Into        Into Income        December 29,\nMillions)            January 3, 2021               2019    Income             January 3, 2021    2019\nInterest\nDebt              $             -473                121    (income)           —                  —\nexpense\nCross Currency                                             Interest\ninterest rate     $               65                488    (income)           —                  —\nswaps                                                      expense\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values.

There were $ 21million and $ 19million, respectively, of changes in fair\nvalue reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or\n56\nthat the changes in fair value will have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or\nfinancial position. The Company also holds equity investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities\nwhich are classified as Level 2. The Company holds acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain\nregulatory and commercial events, which are classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted\ncash flow methodologies or similar techniques for which the determination of fair value requires significant\njudgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:          2020                                        2019\nAssets:                                              Level 1    Level 2    Level 3     Total    Total(1)\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —        849          —       849         209\nInterest rate contracts(2)(3)                              —        240          —       240         693\nTotal                                             $        —      1,089          —     1,089         902\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —        702          —       702         426\nInterest rate contracts(3)                                 —      1,569          —     1,569         193\nTotal                                             $        —      2,271          —     2,271         619\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —         49          —        49          23\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —         38          —        38          33\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:\nEquity investments(4)                                  1,481          —          —     1,481       1,148\nDebt securities(5)                                         —     14,042          —    14,042       4,368\nOther Liabilities\nContingent Consideration(6)                                $                   633       633       1,715\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\n(Dollars in Millions)                          2020    2019\nTotal Gross Assets                        $   1,138     925\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -1,107    -841\nTotal Net Asset                                  31      84\nTotal Gross Liabilities                       2,309     652\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -2,172    -586\nTotal Net Liabilities                     $     137      66\n57\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)                      2020     2019    2018\nBeginning Balance                     $   1,715      397     600\nChanges in estimated fair value(7)       -1,089      151    -156\nAdditions                                   106    1,246     125\nPayments                                    -99      -79    -172\nEnding Balance                        $     633    1,715     397\n(1) 2019 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n1,148million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 1,715million, classified as Level\n3.\n(2) Includes $ 1million of non-current assets as of December 29, 2019.\n(3) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(4) Classified as non-current other assets.\n(5) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(6) Includes $ 594million, $ 1,631million (primarily related to Auris Health) and $ 397million, classified as non-\ncurrent other liabilities as of January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018, respectively.

Further information provided below.\n(4) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nThe fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate, which was primarily\ndriven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV\nFinancing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow\ncompanies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to\nbe depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations\nfor companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research\nand development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1)\ntax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not\nto exceed 5 years. The Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year\n2019, as described in further detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that\nperiod.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF\nlegislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the\nremaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its\nestimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded\nadditional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss\nTax Reform of approximately $ 0.4billion or 2.6% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 0.3billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this\nbenefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 450million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the\nCompany’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates\nrelated to the previously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by\napproximately 1.2% which is\n61\nreflected as a “Tax Benefits on Capital Loss” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition in the fiscal\nyear 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\nthe impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to Talc for $ 4.0billion which reduced the U.S. earnings\nbefore taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%;\nthe accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0billion associated with a revised agreement\nin principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4%\nThe Company also generated additional tax benefits from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or\nvested; reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note 18); and\nreversal of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in\ncertain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\nThe fiscal year 2019 tax rate decreased by 2.3% compared to the fiscal year 2018 tax rate. In addition to the\nimpact of TRAF discussed in more detail below, the primary drivers of the net decrease were as follows:\nThe Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries in the fiscal\nfourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local taxes that it had previously\nrecognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the fiscal year 2017 and finalized\nin the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval by the applicable local\nauthorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 0.6billion and a related deferred tax asset of $\n0.2billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 0.4billion decreasing the annual\neffective tax rate by 2.2%. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s\neffective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $ 4billion (see Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%\nand decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 2.1%.\nIn December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in\nthe Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part\nof the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to\nthese foreign tax credits of approximately $ 0.3billion or 1.7% to the annual effective tax rate. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its\nunrecognized tax benefit by $ 0.3billion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately\n1.5% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information). As these positions were related to\nuncertain tax regarding international transfer pricing, this expense has been classified as “International\nOperations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Subsequent to December 29, 2019, the Company\nreceived and agreed to Notices of Proposed Adjustments (NOPAs) from the IRS. The Company believes it is adequately\nreserved for potential exposures.\nThere were several one-time tax impacts that resulted in a cumulative net tax benefit to the 2018 annual\neffective tax rate of 1.2%. These items included the LifeScan divestiture, the adjustment to the 2017 provisional\nTCJA tax charge and the acceleration of certain tax deductions as part of the 2017 tax return.\nMore income in higher tax jurisdictions relative to lower tax jurisdictions as compared to 2018.\nAs described above for the Swiss tax legislation, in the fiscal year 2019, the Company recorded a net tax expense\nof $ 0.1billion which increased the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2019 by approximately 0.6%. This net tax\nexpense related to federal and certain cantonal enactments in the fiscal year 2019 consisting of the following\nprovisions:\napproximately $ 0.6billion tax expense relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred by December 29, 2019; this expense\nhas been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 0.9billion deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s\neffective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 450million of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities and the new deferred tax asset for the\nFederal step-up. This benefit has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective\ntax rate reconciliation.\n62\nIn the fiscal year 2018, the Company completed its full assessment and finalized the accounting for the impact of\nthe TCJA. The Company recorded net adjustments to the above components of the provisional charge of approximately $\n0.2billion. These revisions were based on updated estimates and additional analysis by management as well as\napplying interpretative guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Treasury to the facts and circumstances that\nexisted as of the TCJA enactment date. This charge was primarily related to additional deferred tax liabilities for\nforeign local and withholding taxes for the remaining balance of undistributed foreign earnings as of December 31,\n2017 that were not provided for in the 2017 provisional charge.\nAs described in Note 1, in the fiscal year 2018, the Company elected to treat GILTI as a period expense under the\ndeferred method and recorded a deferred tax cost of approximately $ 1.4billion in the fiscal year 2018 related to\nfacts and circumstances that existed on the date of TCJA enactment. During 2018, the Company reorganized the\nownership structure of certain foreign subsidiaries which resulted in a reduction of certain foreign withholding\ntaxes that it had recognized as part of the provisional TCJA tax charge in the fourth quarter of 2017. Following\nthe completion of this restructuring and as a result of clarification by Swiss tax authorities regarding the\napplicability of withholding tax to repatriation of certain earnings, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability\nof $ 2.8billion and a related deferred tax asset of $ 0.9billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred\ntax benefit of $ 1.9billion. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s\neffective tax rate reconciliation.\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n2020 Deferred Tax                 2019 Deferred Tax*\n(Dollars in Millions)                                   Asset    Liability                 Asset    Liability\nEmployee related obligations             $              2,434                              2,473\nStock based compensation                                  627                                595\nDepreciation & amortization                               721                              1,122\nNon-deductible intangibles                                          -6,567                             -5,835\nInternational R&D capitalized for tax                   1,517                              1,189\nReserves & liabilities                                  3,466                              2,337\nIncome reported for tax purposes                        1,705                              1,605\nNet operating loss carryforward                           990                                838\ninternational\nUndistributed foreign earnings                            812       -1,435                   765       -1,289\nGlobal intangible low-taxed income                                  -3,606                             -2,965\nMiscellaneous international                               854         -211                   696          -81\nMiscellaneous U.S.                                         12                                411\nTotal deferred income taxes              $             13,138      -11,819                12,031      -10,170\n* Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that\nit is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these\ndeferred tax assets.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits:\n(Dollars in Millions)                        2020     2019     2018\nBeginning of year                        $  3,853    3,326    3,151\nIncreases related to current year tax         265      249      242\npositions\nIncreases related to prior period tax         668      408      145\npositions\nDecreases related to prior period tax        -551     -105     -137\npositions\nSettlements                                  -839       -9      -40\nLapse of statute of limitations               -23      -16      -35\nEnd of year                              $  3,373    3,853    3,326\nThe unrecognized tax benefits of $ 3.4billion at January 3, 2021, if recognized, would affect the Company’s annual\neffective tax rate. The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax\naudits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) has completed its audit for the tax years through 2012. As of December 29, 2019, the Company\nclassified unrecognized tax benefits and related interest\n63\nof approximately $ 0.9billion as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of the Consolidated\nBalance Sheet. In the fiscal year 2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately $ 0.7billion to the\nU.S. Treasury related to the final settlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2006. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to\nprovide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax\npositions.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized\nafter tax interest expense of $ 32million, $ 50million and $ 53million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018,\nrespectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 468million and $ 559million in fiscal years 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n9.\nEmployee Related Obligations\nAt the end of fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2019, employee related obligations recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets\nwere:\n(Dollars in Millions)                  2020      2019\nPension benefits                  $   5,761     5,538\nPostretirement benefits               2,229     2,297\nPostemployment benefits               3,078     3,004\nDeferred compensation                   250       338\nTotal employee obligations           11,318    11,177\nLess current benefits payable           547       514\nEmployee related obligations —    $  10,771    10,663\nnon-current\nPrepaid employee related obligations of $ 656million and $ 551million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, are included\nin Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n64\n10.\nPensions and Other Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily health care, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits\naccrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases\nthe\nPBO as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $ 1.8billion and is included in the “Amendments” line in the Change in\nBenefit Obligation.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree health care benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2020 and 2019 the Company used December 31, 2020and December 31, 2019, respectively, as the measurement date for\nall U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2020,\n2019 and 2018 include the following components:\nRetirement Plans                        Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in Millions)                           2020      2019      2018                   2020    2019    2018\nService cost                     $             1,380     1,163     1,283                    287     274     269\nInterest cost                                    955     1,096       996                    133     185     148\nExpected return on plan                       -2,461    -2,322    -2,212                     -7      -6      -7\nassets\nAmortization of prior service                      2         4         3                    -31     -31     -31\ncost\nRecognized actuarial losses                      891       579       852                    142     129     123\n(gains)\nCurtailments and settlements                      23        73         1                      —       —       —\nNet periodic benefit cost        $               790       593       923                    524     551     502\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is\namortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan\namendment.\n65\nThe following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:\nRetirement Plans                       Other Benefit Plans\nWorldwide Benefit Plans                          2020       2019    2018                   2020    2019    2018\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nService cost discount rate                       2.82  %    3.63    3.20                   3.04    4.45    3.85\nInterest cost discount rate                      3.13  %    4.13    3.60                   3.08    4.25    3.62\nRate of increase in compensation                 4.00  %    3.99    3.98                   4.25    4.29    4.29\nlevels\nExpected long-term rate of return\non                                               8.12  %    8.31    8.46\nplan assets\nBenefit Obligation\nDiscount rate                                    2.14  %    2.91    3.76                   2.23    3.39    4.40\nRate of increase in compensation                 4.00  %    4.01    3.97                   4.27    4.29    4.29\nlevels\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-\nterm fixed income instruments.

In determining investment policies, strategies and goals, each committee or board\nconsiders factors including, local pension rules and regulations; local tax regulations; availability of investment\nvehicles (separate accounts, commingled accounts, insurance funds, etc.); funded status of the plans; ratio of\nactives to retirees; duration of liabilities; and other relevant factors including: diversification, liquidity of\nlocal markets and liquidity of base currency. A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants\nand are expected to be on-going plans.

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator.

The other current and non current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance\nsheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 for foreign currency translation adjustments\nis included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 209million, $\n267million and $ 265million in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\n15.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation of basic net earnings per share to diluted net earnings per share for the fiscal\nyears ended January 3, 2021, December 29, 2019 and December 30, 2018:\n(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts)            2020       2019       2018\nBasic net earnings per share                $     5.59       5.72       5.70\nAverage shares outstanding — basic             2,632.8    2,645.1    2,681.5\nPotential shares exercisable under stock         118.3      136.3      139.0\noption plans\nLess: shares repurchased under treasury          -80.4      -97.8      -92.5\nstock method\nConvertible debt shares                              —        0.7        0.7\nAdjusted average shares outstanding —          2,670.7    2,684.3    2,728.7\ndiluted\nDiluted net earnings per share              $     5.51       5.63       5.61\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2020 excluded 18million shares related to stock\noptions, as the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value. As of January 3, 2021,\nthe Company did not have convertible debt.\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 excluded an insignificant number of shares\nrelated to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average market value of the\nCompany’s stock. The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect\nof convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1million after-tax.\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included all shares related to stock options,\nas the exercise price of all options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock. The diluted net\nearnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2018 included the dilutive effect of convertible debt that was\noffset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1million after-tax.\n16. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\nAt January 3, 2021, the Company had 2stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under\nthe Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive\nPlan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012\nLong-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650million shares of\ncommon stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nsubsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were\n277million at the end of fiscal year 2020.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,005million, $ 977million and $\n978million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 210million, $ 227million and $ 192million for fiscal\nyears 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n248million, $ 209million and $ 264million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, for which options\nwere exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total\n72\nunrecognized compensation cost was $ 804million, $ 823million and $ 827million for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and\n2018, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.76years, 1.71years and\n1.73years for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part\nof inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\nStock Options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New\nYork Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2020, 2019 and 2018 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option.

The\nCompany also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the\nend of a three-yearperformance period. Whether any performance share units vest, and the amount that does vest, is\ntied to the completion of service periods that range from 6months to 3years and the achievement, over a three-\nyearperiod, of three equally-weighted goals that directly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder\nreturn: operational sales, adjusted operational earnings per share, and relative total shareholder return.\nBeginning in fiscal 2020, performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that directly align with\nor help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total\nshareholder return. The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-yearperiod will vary, based only\non actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted .\nA summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 3, 2021\nis presented below:\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding Restricted Share Units    Outstanding Performance Share Units\nShares at December 29, 2019                                16,769                                  2,174\nGranted                                                     5,051                                    816\nIssued                                                     -6,042                                   -702\nCanceled/forfeited/adjusted                                  -780                                    -52\nShares at January 3, 2021                                  14,998                                  2,236\nThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 139.58, $ 121.31and $ 119.67in fiscal years\n2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant.

For additional details on the global supply\nchain restructuring see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n19.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; supplier indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nDue to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company\ncontinues to monitor its legal proceedings as the situation evolves.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 3, 2021, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is\ndetermined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits\nin compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The\nCompany accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as\nestimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent\nprojected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and\nwith different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information\nbecomes available.\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing\nSystem; the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL ® ; XARELTO ® ; body powders containing\ntalc, primarily JOHNSONS ® Baby Powder; INVOKANA ® ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of\nJanuary 3, 2021, in the United States there were approximately 560plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits\nregarding\n84\ninjuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System; 7,800with\nrespect to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; 14,900with respect to pelvic meshes; 9,300with respect to\nRISPERDAL ® ; 12,600with respect to XARELTO ® ; 25,000with respect to body powders containing talc; 300with respect\nto INVOKANA ® ; and 4,200with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh.\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR ™ XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR ™ Hip Resurfacing System used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury have been\nmade against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain\nlawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed. Cases filed in federal courts in the United\nStates have been organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern\nDistrict of Ohio. Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United\nKingdom, Canada, Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a\nCourt-appointed committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip System plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims\nwith eligible ASR Hip patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision\nsurgery, as of August 31, 2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further\nextended the settlement program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 31, 2013 and\nprior to February 15, 2017. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, therefore bringing to\nresolution significant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States\nremain, and the settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class\naction settlement was reached that resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In\nCanada, the Company has reached agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country . The Company\ncontinues to receive information with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a\nworldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement\nprogram and DePuy ASR ™ Hip-related product liability litigation.\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson\n(collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product\nliability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential\ncosts and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized\nas a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation\nhas also been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts\nhave been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first\nquarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the\nsettlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product\nliability litigation associated with the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of\nEthicon's pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company\ncontinues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal\ncourts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia. The MDL Court is remanding cases for trial to the jurisdictions\nwhere the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the\nMDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved a majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs\nassociated with these settlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company's accruals. In addition,\nclass actions and individual personal injury cases or claims have been commenced in various countries outside of\nthe United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and class actions in Israel,\nAustralia and Canada, seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon's pelvic mesh devices. In November\n2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation\nto the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments\nand testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and\npelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company is\nappealing the decision. With respect to other group members, there will be an individual case assessment process\nwhich will require proof of use and causally related loss. The form of the individual case assessment process has\nnot yet been determined by the Court. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a\nsettlement of a group of cases. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation\nassociated with Ethicon's pelvic mesh product s.\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, claims for\npersonal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injury arising out of\nthe use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-\ncounty litigation (MCL) has also been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases\npending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the\nUnited States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh\ndevices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending outside the United States. Discovery is proceeding in\nthese cases and certain of the cases are in preparation for trials.\n85\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the\nPROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court\nentered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court.\nAdditional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the US, and in jurisdictions outside the\nUS. Discovery is underway in these cases.\nIn September 2019, plaintiffs’ attorney filed an application with the New Jersey Supreme Court seeking centralized\nmanagement of 107 PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia System (“PHS”) cases. The New Jersey Supreme Court granted\nplaintiffs application in January 2020 and those cases have also been transferred to an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court. Discovery is underway in these cases.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON\nPHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia\nSystem products.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out\nof the use of RISPERDAL ® , and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or\nmixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits have been\nprimarily filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various\ncourts in the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues\nto receive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has\nsuccessfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict\nin October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one single plaintiff which was subsequently reduced\nin January 2020 to $ 6.8million by the trial judge. The Company and plaintiff are each appealing this judgment. The\nCompany has settled or otherwise resolved many of the United States cases and the costs associated with these\nsettlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO ® , an oral anticoagulant, have been made against\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson (J&J); and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO ® , Bayer\nAG and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition,\ncases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state\nmass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California.\nClass action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and J&J announced an agreement in\nprinciple to the settle the XARELTO ® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May\n2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved\nthe majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated\nwith the United States settlement program and XARELTO ® related product liability litigation.\nPersonal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been made against Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. and\nJohnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. The\nnumber of pending personal injury lawsuits continues to increase, and the Company continues to receive information\nwith respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. Lawsuits have been primarily filed in state\ncourts in Missouri, New Jersey and California, and suits have also been filed outside the United States. The\nmajority of cases are pending in federal court, organized into a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United\nStates District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, the parties sought to exclude experts through\nDaubert motions. In April 2020, the Court issued rulings that limit the scope of testimony, including some theories\nand testing methods, for certain plaintiff expert witnesses and denied plaintiffs’ attempt to limit the scope of\ntestimony of certain of the Company’s witnesses. With this ruling made, case-specific discovery has begun per the\nCourt’s directive.\nIn talc cases that have previously gone to trial, the Company has obtained defense verdicts in a number of them,\nbut there have also been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020,\nthe Missouri Court of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham\nv. Johnson & Johnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion and, with\nadditional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently $ 2.5billion (the\nIngham decision). An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied,\nand the Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. The Company continues to believe\nthat it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts that it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company\nhas and may settle cases. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for the resolution\nof certain cases and claims, including the Ingham decision currently on appeal , in connection with product\nliability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary chapter 11 petition commencing\na reorganization under\n86\nthe United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (Imerys\nBankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’ potential liability for personal injury from exposure to\ntalcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy filing, Imerys noted certain claims it alleges it has\nagainst the Company for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. The Company previously proposed to\nresolve Imerys' (and the Company’s) obligations arising out of the Talc Claims by agreeing to assume the defense of\nlitigation of all Talc Claims involving the Company's products, waiving the Company’s indemnification claims\nagainst Imerys, and lifting the automatic stay to enable the Talc Claims to proceed outside the bankruptcy forum\nwith the Company agreeing to settle or pay any judgment against Imerys. In May 2020, Imerys and the asbestos\nclaimants’ committee (Plan Proponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement\nrelated thereto agreeing to put its North American operations up for auction which was subsequently amended. The\nCompany has objected to the Disclosure Statement and intends to object to the Plan of Reorganization as currently\nstructured. Additionally, in June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (Cyprus) filed an adversary\nproceeding against the Company as well as Imerys seeking a declaration of indemnity under certain contractual\nagreements. The Company denies such indemnification is owed and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint\narguing, among other things, that the Court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over Cyprus’s claims against\nthe Company. The Plan Proponents filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement to which the\nCompany objected. A hearing on the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court\nentered an order approving the Disclosure Statement for the Ninth Amended Joint Chapter 11 Plan of Reorganization\nof Imerys Talc America, Inc. and its Debtor Affiliates allowing Debtors to proceed with soliciting votes on the\nPlan. The Company intends to continue to object to the Plan. A hearing to consider confirmation of the Plan has\nbeen scheduled for June 2021.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers\nin the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the\nfederal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc,\nprimarily JOHNSON'S® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.\nPlaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion\nwas complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020,\nDefendants answered the complaint. Discovery is underway.\nIn June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books\nand records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a\ncross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. The Court has not\nyet ruled in the books and records action. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020, four shareholders\nfiled four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and its current\ndirectors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey,\nalleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing\ntalc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of those\nalleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption In re\nJohnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation .\nIn July 2020, a report was delivered to the Company’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the\nBoard to investigate the allegations in the derivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the\nBoard received raising similar issues. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs in th e In re\nJohnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . The independent counsel recommended that the Company\nreject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of the\nderivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report. In\nOctober 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to\ndismiss the consolidated complaint.\nIn January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan\nagainst Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by\noffering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do\nso because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed\na motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020,\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint.

In that lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide\nrequired Proposition 65 warnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter.\nIn October 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which\nrelief may be granted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019,\nthe Company moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. In April 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs\nfiled a Fourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended\ncomplaint. Plaintiffs filed a Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth\nAmended Complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued\nan Order and opinion ruling in the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice.\n87\nIn January 2020, the Abtahi Law Group filed an action under Proposition 65 against Johnson & Johnson and Johnson &\nJohnson Consumer Inc. as well as a number of other alleged talcum powder manufacturers and distributors, including\none California company. In that action, the plaintiff alleges contamination of talcum powder products with unsafe\nlevels of arsenic, hexavalent chromium and lead. The plaintiff seeks civil penalties and injunctive relief.\nDefendants filed a motion for summary judgment in January 2021, and a hearing has been scheduled for April 2021.\nLimited informal discovery is continuing.\nIn addition, the Company has received preliminary inquiries and subpoenas to produce documents regarding these\nmatters from Senator Murray, a member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, the\nDepartment of Justice, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the U.S. Congressional Subcommittee on\nEconomic and Consumer Policy. The Company produced documents as required in response and will continue to cooperate\nwith government inquiries. In November 2020, the SEC terminated its investigation.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson, arising out of the use of INVOKANA ® , a prescription medication\nindicated to improve glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal\ncourts in the United States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for\nthe District of New Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in\nCanada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases.

Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain\nof the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the\npayment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated\nintangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\nMedical Devices\nIn November 2016, MedIdea, L.L.C. (MedIdea) filed a patent infringement lawsuit against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. in\nthe United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging infringement by the ATTUNE ® Knee\nSystem.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the applicable patents.\nIn the event the subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic statutory stay of the ANDAs expires\nbefore the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the third-party companies involved would have the\nability, upon approval of the FDA, to introduce generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the\npotential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a\nnon-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, subsidiaries may\nsettle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products\nat issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant patents.

Such regulation has been the basis of government\ninvestigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by,\ngovernment agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil\npenalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\nJohnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous\nother pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts\ninvolving allegations\n93\nthat the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise actionable\nconduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale Price (AWP) for\nthe drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement levels. The\nplaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any portion of the\npurchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the\ndrugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court,\nwere consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP\nDefendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved\nthrough court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative\nclass action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen\nBiotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been resolved.\nOpioid Litigation\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along\nwith other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in more than 3,100lawsuits related to the marketing of\nopioids, including DURAGESIC ® , NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ® ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously\nowned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both\nsubsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments.\nSimilar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the\nfollowing: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and\nhealth insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical companies, including Johnson & Johnson and JPI,\nhave been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,\nMississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas,\nWashington and West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court\nby city, county and local government agencies in the following states: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California,\nConnecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mississippi,\nMissouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina; Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West\nVirginia and Wisconsin. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in Superior Court of San Juan. There are more than\n370 cases pending in various state courts. There are over 2,800 federal cases coordinated in a federal Multi-\nDistrict Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio (MDL No. 2804). In\naddition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit in Canada. In October 2019, an anti-trust complaint was filed\nby private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a\nvariety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public\nnuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits\ngenerally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are\nseeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result\nin the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of\nabatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nThe trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson & Johnson and\nJPI in the amount of $ 572million, subject to a final order to be issued by the Court. The Court issued a final\njudgment reducing the amount to $ 465million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI have appealed the judgment. The Company\nbelieves that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI announced\na settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio.\nJohnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information\nrelated to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New\nHampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, Johnson & Johnson and JPI were\ncontacted by the Texas and Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a\nmulti-state Attorney General investigation. In October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in\nprinciple that would include the Company paying $ 4billion as settlement of these matters. In October 2020, the\nCompany agreed to contribute up to an additional $ 1billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve\nopioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $\n5billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in\nprinciple is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims\nby states, cities and counties. The Company cannot predict if or when the agreement will be finalized and\nindividual cases are ongoing.\nIn August 2019, Johnson & Johnson received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the\nEastern District of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and\ndistribution of its\n94\nopioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into manufacturers’ and\ndistributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act. In September 2019, Johnson &\nJohnson received subpoenas from the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) as part of an industry-\nwide inquiry into the effect of opioid prescriptions on New York health insurance premiums.

A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n101\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.2 billion as of January\n3, 2021. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate\nprograms, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience,\npatient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related\nto contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in\nthe U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing\nan independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend\nanalysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating\nthose claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and\n(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments\nabout future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. There have been\nverdicts against the Company for this matter, including a verdict in July 2018 of $4.7 billion, which was reversed\nin part and affirmed in part by the Missouri Court of Appeals in June 2020, reducing the overall award to $2.1\nbillion and, with additional interest as of January 3, 2021, as the Company pursues further appeal, is currently\n$2.5 billion. An application for transfer of the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and\nthe Company is currently seeking review by the United States Supreme Court. As described by management, the Company\ncontinues to believe that it has strong legal grounds for the appeal of this verdict, as well as other verdicts it\nhas appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances\nthe Company has and may settle cases. The Company has established an accrual for defense costs and reserves for\nsettlement of certain cases and claims, as well as one case currently on appeal, in connection with product\nliability litigation associated with body powders containing talc.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred and when\n102\ndetermining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for each claim can be made, which in turn\nled to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating\nmanagement’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual\nand potential litigation with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external counsel when deemed\nnecessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and external legal counsel for\nsignificant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment regarding whether an\nunfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (v) evaluating the sufficiency\nof the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\nLitigation – Opioids\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered\nagainst the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond\nthe amounts already accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; matters present\nlegal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty\nand unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. The Company has\nbeen named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local governments related to opioids matters. The\ntrial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company in the amount\nof $572 million which was subsequently reduced to $465 million. The Company has appealed the judgment and, as\ndescribed by management, believes that it has strong grounds to overturn this judgment. Separately in October 2019,\nthe Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as\nsettlement of the lawsuits. In October 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an\nall-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and\ntribal governments, for a total of $5 billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an\nagreement being finalized. As described by management, this agreement in principle is not an admission of liability\nor wrong-doing and would resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities and counties.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is\na critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred for the judgment against the Company in Oklahoma and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the\nrange of loss for the proposed agreement in principle to settle opioids litigation can be made, which in turn led\nto a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s\nassessment of the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether\na loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known\nactual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as\nwell as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with\ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 22, 2021\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n103\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of January 3, 2021. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January\n3, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 3, 2021 has been audited\nby PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which\nappears herein.\n/s/ Alex Gorsky                 /s/ Joseph J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Alex Gorsky, Chairman and Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated\nin this evaluation.

Gorsky and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective\nReports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated\nherein by reference to \"Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\", and the attestation\nregarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the \"Report of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm\" included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 3, 2021, there were\nno changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not\nexperienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of its\nemployees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate\nand refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance\nthat the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.",
