          "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 138,100 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson &\nJohnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world.\nThe Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated\nin the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) is the Company's Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer).\nThe Executive Committee is Johnson & Johnson’s senior leadership team responsible for setting the strategy and\npriorities of the Company and driving accountability at all levels. Within the strategic parameters provided by the\nExecutive Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international operating companies are each responsible\nfor their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those companies.\nSegments of business\nThe Company is organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. Additional information\nrequired by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and\noperating results under: Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial\ncondition of this Report; and Note 17 Segments of business and geographic areas of the notes to consolidated\nfinancial statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nInnovative Medicine\nThe Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid\narthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), Infectious Diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS),\nNeuroscience (e.g., mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate\ncancer, hematologic malignancies, lung cancer and bladder cancer), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis,\ndiabetes and macular degeneration) and Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension).

Key products in the Innovative Medicine segment include: REMICADE (infliximab),\na treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment\nfor adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis\nand moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for\nadults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis\nand active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older; STELARA\n(ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active\npsoriatic arthritis, for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and treatment of moderately to\nseverely active ulcerative colitis; TREMFYA (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque\npsoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis and ulcerative colitis; EDURANT (rilpivirine), PREZISTA (darunavir) and\nPREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency\nvirus (HIV) in combination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA\n(darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of\nHIV; CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) extended-release tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity\ndisorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective\ndisorder in adults; INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients\nafter they have been adequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA for at least four months; SPRAVATO (Esketamine), a\nnasal spray, used along with an oral antidepressant, to treat adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and\ndepressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal thoughts or actions; CARVYKTI\n(ciltacabtagene autoleucel), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for the treatment of patients with\nrelapsed/refractory multiple\n2024 Annual Report1\nmyeloma; ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEADA (apalutamide), a\nnext-generation androgen receptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA\n(ibrutinib), a treatment for certain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease;\nDARZALEX (daratumumab), a treatment for multiple myeloma; DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a\ntreatment for multiple myeloma and light chain (AL) Amyloidosis; TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), a ready-to-use\nbispecific antibody for adults with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least four prior\nlines of therapy; XARELTO (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep vein thrombosis (DVT),\nwhich may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery, to reduce the\nrisk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and for the treatment and\nreduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients with\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), for the treatment and secondary prevention of\nthromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients following the Fontan\nprocedure; OPSUMIT (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term treatment of\npulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous, selective IP\nreceptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in collaboration\nwith strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle development programs.\nMedTech\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the cardiovascular, orthopaedics, surgery, and\nvision categories. The Cardiovascular (previously referred to as Interventional solutions) portfolio includes\nelectrophysiology products to treat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes\ntechnologies to treat severe coronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock, circulatory\nrestoration products (Shockwave) for the treatment of calcified coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery\ndisease (PAD), and neurovascular care that treats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio\nincludes products and enabling technologies that support hips, knees, trauma, spine, sports, and others. The\nSurgery portfolios include advanced and general surgery technologies, as well as solutions that focus on breast\naesthetics and reconstruction (Mentor). Vision products include ACUVUE brand contact lenses and TECNIS intraocular\nlenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals, and retailers and are used\npredominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals, and clinics.\nGeographic areas\nThe Company conducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to\nhuman health and well-being. The products made and sold in the international business include many of those\ndescribed above under Segments of Business – Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, the principal markets,\nproducts and methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The\nproducts sold in the international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. Significant legal proceedings\n2\nand claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19 Legal\nproceedings—Intellectual property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and\nhyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 13.1% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2024.\nAccordingly, the patents related to these products are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two\npatent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families.\nThe two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound/use patent protection in\nselect countries extends to 2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX\nFASPRO.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately 11.7% of the\nCompany's total revenues for fiscal 2024. According to patent settlement and license agreements, the Company\nexpects continued launches of biosimilar versions of STELARA in Europe and the United States in 2025 which will\nimpact the Company’s sales of STELARA.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier\nin the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally\nfor advertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and other\njurisdictions. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable\nenvironmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a\nmaterial effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations, and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the pharmaceutical product and medical technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various\nfederal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and\nsafety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA)\ncontinues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new\ndrugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also\nevident in major markets outside of the U.S.\n2024 Annual Report3\nThe medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber security\nlaws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Within the U.S., an increasing\nnumber of U.S. States have enacted comprehensive privacy laws, and federal regulators (e.g., the U.S. FDA, FTC and\nHHS) continue to stress the intersection of health and privacy as a compliance and enforcement priority. In the EU,\nmultiple directives and laws (including NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act, and the AI Act) are\nrapidly changing privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new enforcement risks. In\naddition, China has introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations, with more\nanticipated, thereby increasing China’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer practices. With other\njurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater accountability on\nthe collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry. These laws can also restrict transfers\nof data across borders, potentially impacting how data-driven health care solutions are developed and deployed\nglobally in a compliant manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and availability of Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more comprehensive and nuanced\nregulation to ensure the ethical use, privacy, and security of AI is underway that includes standards for\ntransparency, accountability, and fairness, which will require compliance developments or enhancements.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has\nbeen required or directed to.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our\npharmaceutical products or medical technologies are ineffective or pose an unreasonable safety risk, the U.S. FDA\ncould ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement,\nor refund of such products, withdraw approval for such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing\nauthorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health\nprofessionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The\nU.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating\nrestrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of\napplicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse\nregulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products\nand limit our ability to obtain future clearances, classifications or approvals, and could result in a substantial\nmodification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different\ncountries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare\ngenerally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent\nfraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships\nbetween healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various state and federal transparency laws and regulations\nrequire disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to certain healthcare practitioners, including\nphysicians, teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing\ninternational business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions\nwith respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payors and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are a\npotent force in the marketplace, and increased attention is being paid to the impact of PBM practices on healthcare\ncost and access in the U.S.\nOur business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing,\ncoverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the\nInflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish\nprices for certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in\n2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (“CMS”) published the first “Selected Drug” list, which includes XARELTO and STELARA as well as\nIMBRUVICA, which is developed in collaboration and co-commercialized in the U.S. with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie\ncompany. The Selected Drug list also included other medicines targeting disease states that are prevalent in the\nMedicare population. Although CMS published an explanation for how it determined prices for selected drugs in\nDecember 2024, uncertainty remains as to the methodology used to determine these prices. The IRA specifies a\nceiling price but not a minimum price for selected drugs and does not require CMS to use a specific framework for\ndetermining selected drug prices. In any event, we anticipate that the selected products will be subjected to a\ngovernment-established price for the Medicare population beginning in 2026.\n4\nThe IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of\ninflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs.\nSeparate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater\nportion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount\nprogram with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject\nmanufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties.\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nIRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates\nJanssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen\nis not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader\npharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies\nremains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs,\nimplementation of the program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of\nits summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies,\nand other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to\nincrease pricing transparency and controls.\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that\nwould affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both\npositive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various\nprovisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions\nfor our products.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection\nauthorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied\non companies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In\nthe U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant\nsettlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use and disclosure\nof personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection\nand use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nand subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in\nthe Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\n2024 Annual Report5\nEmployees and human capital management\nAs of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 the number of employees was approximately:\n2024             2023\nEmployees(1)                               139,800          134,400\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions(2)    138,100          131,900\n(1) “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded. Shockwave has been included in the fiscal 2024 headcount in the above table.\n(2) FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nEmployees by region (in percentages)\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting top talent\nDeveloping and retaining top talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on innovation, health,\nwell-being and safety, inclusion and belonging where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed both\nprofessionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and employee engagement\nAt Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo, which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to\npatients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees\nworldwide must adhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct, which sets fundamental requirements and serves as\na foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on\nexpected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its\nemployees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and\nidentify opportunities to improve. In 2024, 94% of global employees across 73 countries participated in Our Credo\nSurvey which was offered in 36 languages.\n6\nGrowth and development\nTo lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top\ntalent. In 2024, the Company's voluntary turnover rate was 6.3%. The Company believes that its employees must be\nequipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their\ncareers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources are available to all employees.\nThe Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while\ncreating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this\nobjective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they\nare on their career journey. To prioritize learning, the Company recently held Johnson & Johnson's second Global\nLearning Day. Employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill-building courses on J&J Learn, the\nnew state-of-the-art learning platform.\nOur workforce\nAs stated in Our Credo, we are responsible to our employees who work with us throughout the world. The Company is\ncommitted to cultivating, fostering and advancing an inclusive, credo-based work environment for employees that\nrecognizes and rewards based on merit. The Company is dedicated to the values in Our Credo and strives to meet the\nneeds of its employees and stakeholders through compliance with law and the following evidence based strategies:\nSustain a global workforce of individuals with many different backgrounds, abilities, cultures and perspectives\nMaintain a work environment where each person’s dignity is respected and they have an opportunity to advance\nbased on their merit\nDrive innovation and growth with our business to serve markets around the world\nOur approach with respect to our workforce is guided by applicable laws, internal and external insights, global\nbest practices and employee feedback.\nCompensation and benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fair treatment in its compensation and benefits for\nemployees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where possible. The\nCompany's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being, including\nannual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare benefits,\npaid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs.\nHealth, wellness and safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company works to ensure that all its employees around the world, as well as contingent workers,\ncontractors and visitors to the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and\nwell-being programs throughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to\nkeep its offerings best-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and\npractices the Company provides—physical, mental, emotional and financial—help promote holistic employee health. The\nCompany continues to address our employees needs through J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers the Company’s\noffice-based employees to find a balance of in-person and remote work, while preserving the Company's culture and\nneed for face-to-face engagement and leadership.\n2024 Annual Report7\nAvailable information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com .

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks related to our business, industry and operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in its two operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development. The Company may also experience\noperational and financial risk in connection with acquisitions if we are unable to fully identify potential risks\nand liabilities associated with acquired businesses or products, successfully integrate operations and employees,\nand successfully identify and realize synergies with existing businesses while containing acquisition-related\nstrain on our management, operations and financial resources.\nFor the Company’s Innovative Medicine businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic, biosimilar and other competing\nproducts and enter the market. For the Company’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality,\nreputation and customer service are especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new\nor improved products, processes and technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less\ndesirable, less economical or obsolete. The Company’s business and operations will be negatively impacted if we are\nunable to introduce new products or technological advances that are safe, more effective, more effectively marketed\nor otherwise outperform those of our competitors.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacturing of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 64 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other\nsevere weather events, raw material shortages, lack of available inspectors, political unrest, terrorist attacks\nand epidemics or pandemics. Such delays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines\nin sales and reputational impact as well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing\nthe shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a\nthird-party manufacturer or supplier could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our raw materials, component parts and\nproducts. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity\nsufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and\nto deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these\nthird-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could\nresult in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.\n2024 Annual Report9\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the\nthird party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual\nproperty, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third\nparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that\nis costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to\nfacilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties,\nis unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the\nCompany may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need\nto seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased\ncosts which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nGlobal health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such\nincident(s), a health crisis or health crises). The spread of health crises have caused and may cause the Company\nto modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the\nCompany determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners under such\ncircumstances. Impacts to the Company have included and may include adverse impacts to results of operations and\nfinancial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. While\nthe Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network designed to help\nmitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely\naffected in the event of a health crisis. Health crises could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including,\namong other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-party suppliers, sales and marketing, and\nclinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results,\nand global economic conditions generally.\nRisks related to government regulation and legal proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare\nreforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by\nthird-party payors such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations.\nAs part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors are putting downward pressure on prices at\nwhich products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political\nscrutiny on pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) has changed Medicare Part D benefit design and has subjected certain of the\nCompany's products to government-established pricing beginning in 2026 and may subject additional products in the\nfuture. Failure to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law pending ongoing litigation may expose the\nCompany to penalties. In addition, change to Medicare Part D could have a negative impact on U.S. Innovative\nMedicine sales. Further, increased third-party utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program from expanded\ninterpretations of the statute and program abuse may have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance.\nOutside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive\ngovernment involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls,\nlimit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property\nprotection.\n10\nWe are subject to an increasing number of costly and complex governmental regulations in the countries in which\noperations are conducted which may materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and business\noperations.\nAs described in Item 1. Business, the Company is subject to an increasing number of extensive government laws and\nregulations, investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other\ncountries in which it operates. For example, changes to the U.S. FDA’s timing or requirements for approval or\nclearance of our products may have a negative impact on our ability to bring new products to market. New and\nchanging laws, regulations, executive orders and other directives may also impose deadlines on the Company, or its\nthird-party suppliers, manufacturers or other partners and providers, for which there may be insufficient time to\nimplement changes to comply with such new regulations and may result in manufacturing delays or other supply chain\nconstraints. If the Company is unable to identify ways to mitigate these delays or constraints, there may be an\nadverse effect on sales and access to our products.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible\nto predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The Company has been and could in the future be required to pay\nsignificant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these matters, potentially in excess of accruals,\nincluding matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally liable among other defendants. The\nresolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period. The Company does not\npurchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a wholly owned captive insurance\ncompany subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nProduct concerns, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not\nbased on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental investigations, regulatory\naction on the part of the U.S. FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of\nfines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to\nbrand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product recalls have in the past, and could\nin the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities,\ncontinued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs, reputational damage,\npossible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nThe rapid increase in new government laws and regulations imposes significant compliance costs to the Company and a\nfailure of the Company to timely implement changes to comply with these new laws may expose the Company to\ninvestigations, legal actions or penalties. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing\nPractices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs and devices\ncan lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new\nproduct approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are\nsubject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\nthe Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer\nprotection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys\ngeneral in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and\ncriminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs.\nAny such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The\nmost significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19\nLegal proceedings—Government proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n2024 Annual Report11\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, such as the enactment by certain EU and non-EU countries, and the anticipated\nenactment by additional countries, of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax\nrate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any\ncountry would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that\nparticular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense\nor benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these\nproposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any\ntime, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law\nchange is enacted.\nSee Note 8 Income taxes under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for\nadditional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose\nmore information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\nprofits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on\ntax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\nreserves.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and the inability of the\nCompany to secure and maintain these rights may have a detrimental impact on the Company’s financial results.\nPublic policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly unfavorable toward intellectual property\nrights. The Company cannot be certain that it will secure and maintain adequate patent protection for new products\nand technologies in the United States and other important markets.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, others may claim the Company has infringed their intellectual\nproperty rights, including copyrights, patents, or trademarks, and/or has misappropriated their trade secrets, any\nof which could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely\naffect the competitive position and sales of our products.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such\nchallenges, or upon the “at-risk” launch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a\nmajor portion of revenues for the referenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings\ninvolving the Company’s patents and other intellectual property rights are described in Note 19 Legal\nproceedings—Intellectual property under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport.\n12\nRisks related to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation, development and implementation of new products,\ntechnologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing\nproducts lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products\nintroduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2024 sales. The Company cannot be certain\nwhen or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies,\nwhether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products\nwill be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. Moreover, the development and\nregulatory approval of new products may be delayed due to limits on federal agency budgets or personnel, including\nreductions to the U.S. FDA’s budget, employees, and operations, which may lead to slower response times and longer\nreview periods. After approval, new products or enhancements to existing products may not be accepted quickly or\nsignificantly in the marketplace due to product and price competition, changes in customer preferences or\nhealthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement.\nEven following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product can be adversely impacted by safety and\nefficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as market entry of competitive products.\nThe Company leverages the use of data science, machine learning and other forms of AI and emerging technologies\nacross varying parts of its business and operations, and the introduction and incorporation of AI may result in\nunintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities. AI technology is continuously evolving, and\nthe AI technologies we develop and adopt may become obsolete earlier than planned. Our investments in these\ntechnologies may not result in the benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive\nadvantage. The application of AI in our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws and regulations that\nmay entail significant costs or ultimately limit our ability to continue the use of these technologies. These\ntechnologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security further described below.\nRisks related to financial and economic market conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting\nbusiness internationally.\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign currency exchange : In fiscal 2024, approximately 43% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 23% in Europe, 5% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 15% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and currency devaluation risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in\nArgentina, Turkey, Venezuela and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as\nthe prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins\nin these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might\nexperience operating losses as a result of continued inflation.\n2024 Annual Report13\nIn addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant\ncurrency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.\nIllegal importation of pharmaceutical products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-bribery and other regulations : The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and\nenforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including\nthe U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement\nactivities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and\nactions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including\nexclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther financial, economic, legal, social and political risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\ninclude:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates,\nmonetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other\nlimitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures, increased antitrust\nreporting requirements and enforcement activity, and import/export licensing requirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nDue to the international nature of the Company's business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, including\nglobal tensions and war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAs described above, the Company has extensive operations and business activity throughout the world. Global\ntensions, conflict and/or war among any of the countries in which we conduct business or distribute our products\nmay result in foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in affected countries, and challenges\nto our global supply chain related to increased costs of materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers.\nMost recently, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, impacts to the Company's business\nresulting from the Russia-Ukraine war, rising conflict in the Middle East as well as increasing tensions between\nthe U.S. and China. In response to heightened conflict, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, governments may impose\nexport controls and broad financial and economic sanctions. Our business and operations may be further impacted by\nthe imposition of tariffs, trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any country that favor domestic\ncompanies and technologies over foreign competitors. Additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the\nglobal community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents,\ntrademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, in some countries, such as in Russia, action may be\ntaken that allows companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States\nand many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from\npracticing the Company's inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into Russia. In\naddition, the U.S. government recently announced tariffs on products manufactured in several jurisdictions,\nincluding China, Mexico and Canada, and has\n14\nmade announcements regarding the potential imposition of tariffs on other jurisdictions. While certain of the\nannounced tariffs have been delayed, the U.S. government may in the future pause, reimpose or increase tariffs, and\ncountries subject to such tariffs have and in the future may impose reciprocal tariffs or other restrictive trade\nmeasures in response. Any of these actions could increase uncertainties and associated risks relating to the\nCompany’s global operations.\nWeak financial performance, failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating or disruptions in the financial\nmarkets could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nOther risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented and highly skilled employees.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing many different backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a credo-based work\nenvironment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we cannot\nretain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services\nmay be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important to our long-term success. Any\nunsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth\ntransitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an\ninfluence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in\nloss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact on the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks,\nand those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data (including confidential research,\nbusiness plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\nprotection) to ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain and operations, and as part of many of the\nproducts we deliver to customers. The extensive range of information security and cybersecurity threats, which\naffect companies globally, pose a persistent risk to the security and availability of these systems and networks,\nincluding to customer products that are connected to or rely on such systems and networks, and the confidentiality,\nintegrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company assesses these threats, responds to\nattacks and breaches that it has experienced, and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and\nresponse capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and\n2024 Annual Report15\ncontrols, to address this risk. Because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased\nvolume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This\nimpact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and\nregulatory action. Also, increasing use of AI could increase these risks. The Company maintains cybersecurity\ninsurance in the event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to\ncover all financial, legal, business or reputational losses.\nAs a result of increased global tensions, the Company expects there will continue to be, an increased risk of\ninformation security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by adversaries of countries\nwhere the Company maintains operations. Given the potential sophistication of these attacks, the Company may not be\nable to address the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate\npreventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly,\nor at all, which could adversely affect customers that use our products, our business, results of operations or\nfinancial condition. Moreover, these threats could also impact our third-party partners resulting in compromise of\nthe Company's IT systems, networks and data which could negatively affect the Company.\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact on\nthe Company’s business or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws and regulations across the globe that impose broad\ncompliance obligations on the collection, possession, use, storage, access, disclosure, transfer, deletion and\nprotection of personal data. Breach of the requirements of these laws and regulations could result in substantial\nfines, penalties, governmental actions, private right of actions, including class actions, and damage to our\nreputation and business. New privacy laws are expected globally, together with greater privacy enforcement by\ngovernmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and data transfers including\ninternational data flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls with which our\nbusinesses worldwide are required to comply. However, with many technology and data-driven initiatives evolving\nacross the Company, involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are threats that could impact our business\noperations and research activities, including potential risks of unauthorized access and loss of personal data as\nwell as legislative actions imposing limitations and controls on the use and sharing of personal data as well as on\ncross border data flows.\n16",

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nThe Company has documented cybersecurity policies and standards, assesses risks from cybersecurity threats, and\nmonitors information systems for potential cybersecurity issues. To protect the Company’s information systems from\ncybersecurity threats, the Company uses various security tools supporting protection, detection, and response\ncapabilities. The Company maintains a cybersecurity incident response plan to help ensure a timely, consistent\nresponse to actual or attempted cybersecurity incidents impacting the Company.\nThe Company also identifies and assesses third-party risks within the enterprise, and through the Company's use of\nthird-party service providers, across a range of areas including data security and supply chain through a\nstructured third-party risk management program.\nThe Company maintains a formal information security training program for all employees that includes training on\nmatters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required to complete mandatory\ntraining on data privacy.\nTo evaluate and enhance its cybersecurity program, the Company periodically utilizes third-party experts to\nundertake maturity assessments of the Company’s information security program.\nTo date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business or operations; however, because of the frequently changing attack\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\nCompany to be adversely impacted.This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other\nbusiness harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. Refer to the risk factor captioned An information\nsecurity incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or\nreputation in Part I, Item 1A. Risk factors for additional description of cybersecurity risks and potential related\nimpacts on the Company.\nGovernance - management’s responsibility\nThe Company takes a risk-based approach to cybersecurity and has implemented cybersecurity controls designed to\naddress cybersecurity threats and risks. The Chief Information Officer (CIO), who is a member of the Company’s\nExecutive Committee, and the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)are responsible for assessing and managing\ncybersecurity risks, including security incident detection, response, and recovery.\nThe Company’s CISO, in coordination with the CIO, is responsible for leading the Company’s cybersecurity program\nand management of cybersecurity risk. The current CISO has over twenty-five years of experience in information\nsecurity, and his background includes technical experience, strategy and architecture focused roles, cyber and\nthreat experience, and various leadership roles.\nGovernance - board oversight\nThe Company’s Board of Directorsoversees the overall risk management process, including cybersecurity risks,\ndirectly and through its committees. The Regulatory Compliance & Sustainability Committee (RCSC) of the board is\nprimarily responsible for oversight of risk from cybersecurity threats and oversees compliance with applicable\nlaws, regulations and Company policies related to, among others, privacy and cybersecurity.\nRCSC meetings include discussions of specific risk areas throughout the year including, among others, those\nrelating to cybersecurity. The CISO provides quarterly updates each year to RCSC on cybersecurity matters. These\nreports include an overview of the cybersecurity threat landscape, key cybersecurity initiatives to improve the\nCompany’s risk posture, changes in the legal and regulatory landscape relative to cybersecurity, and overviews of\ncertain cybersecurity incidents that have occurred within the Company and within the industry.\n2024 Annual Report17",

The decline of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales was driven by share loss primarily due to European biosimilar\nentrants. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) was due to continued biosimilar competition. The growth of TREMFYA\n(guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains.\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $6.7 billion in fiscal 2024. Third parties have filed\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA.\nThe Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.\nAccording to patent settlement and license agreements, the Company expects continued launches of biosimilar\nversions of STELARA in Europe and the United States in 2025 which will impact the Company’s sales of STELARA.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nInfectious disease products sales were $3.4 billion in 2024, a decline of 23.1% as compared to the prior year\nprimarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue.\nNeuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2024, representing a decrease of 0.4% as compared to the prior\nyear primarily driven by a decline in Other Neuroscience. The decline was partially offset by the growth of\nSPRAVATO (esketamine) driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and patient demand.\nOncology products achieved sales of $20.8 billion in 2024, representing an increase of 17.7% as compared to the\nprior year. Strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains and market growth. Growth\nof ERLEADA (apalutamide) was primarily due to continued share gains and market growth. Sales of CARVYKTI\n(ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing\nefficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launches of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), TALVEY (talquetamab-\ntgvs) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab), included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially\noffset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global\ncompetitive pressures.\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $4.3 billion, representing an increase of 12.3% as compared to the prior\nyear. Sales growth of both OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) was driven by market growth and share\ngains. Growth in Other Pulmonary Hypertension was driven by OPSYNVI (macitentan/tadalafil).\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.6 billion, a decline of 3.0% as compared to the prior year\ndriven by declines in Other.\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B\ncovered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee\ncovered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been\nand will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it\nbelieves its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited\nby the 340B statute.

For discussion related to the fiscal year 2024 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which\ngenerally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. Several\nEU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with\nother aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. In the fiscal year 2024, the net impact of Pillar Two\nlegislation was less than 1.0% to the Company’s effective tax rate. While countries continue to enact new\nprovisions or issue new regulations, based on current guidance, the Company expects the net impact of Pillar Two in\nfiscal year 2025 to be up to 1.0% to the Company’s effective tax rate.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nLiquidity & cash flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $24.1 billion at the end of 2024 as compared to $21.9 billion at the end of 2023.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $2.2 billion increase were:\n(Dollars in billions)\n$21.9    Q4 2023 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n24.3    cash generated from operating activities\n-18.6    net cash used by investing activities\n-3.1    net cash used by financing activities\n-0.4    effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$24.1    Q4 2024 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $0.4 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2024 and $1.1 billion\nat the end of fiscal year 2023.

The debt balance at the end of 2024 was $36.6 billion as compared to $29.3 billion in 2023.\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $6.7 billion. For\nadditional details on borrowings, see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this\noffering were used to fund the Shockwave acquisition which closed on May 31, 2024, and for general corporate\npurposes. Considering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity\nprofile and does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows,\nthe ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and\naccess to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs,\nincluding the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately\n$1.5 billion and the approximately $11.6 billion ($13.5 billion nominal) reserve for talc matters (See Note 19 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital\nmarkets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444\nshares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an initial public offering of\n$22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book\nvalue of the Johnson & Johnson\n34\ndivested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital. As of the closing of the IPO,\nJohnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2,\n2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to\nnon-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common\nStock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson\ncommon stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the\nCompany owned 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within\ncontinuing operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nJohnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the\ndate of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the\ndeconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net\nearnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third\nquarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson\n& Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOn May 15, 2024, the Company issued $3.6 billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $3.6\nbillion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17, 2024, the Company completed a\nDebt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550 shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial\nPaper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged and the\nCompany no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock.

For the proposed talc settlement payments,\nsee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2024 Annual Report35\nFinancing and market risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 29, 2024 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December\n29, 2024 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.2 billion. In\neither scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.5 billion. In either scenario, at\nmaturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $8.0 million.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In June 2024, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on June 25, 2025. Interest charged on\nborrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference\nRate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are\nnot material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2024 and 2023 were $36.6 billion and $29.3 billion, respectively. The increase in\nthe borrowings was due to the issuance of new debt in 2024. In 2024, net debt (cash and current marketable\nsecurities, net of debt) was $12.1 billion compared to net debt of $6.4 billion in 2023. Total debt represented\n34.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2024 and 30.0% of total capital in 2023.\nShareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2024 was $29.70 compared to $28.57 at year-end 2023.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2024 for the 62 nd consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.91 per share\nin 2024 and $4.70 per share in 2023.\nOn January 2, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on March 4,\n2025 to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2025.\n36\nOther information\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback\nprovisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates and discounts\nare estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected\nmarket conditions in the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of\nproducts primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data,\nas well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that have lost\npatent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other\nmarketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company\ngenerally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in\naccordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves\nare recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segment are almost exclusively not\nresalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not\nmaterial. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2024,\n2023 and 2022.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and\ninclude volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales\nvolumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to\ndetermine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns\nprofit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to\ncustomers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2024 and 2023,\nrespectively, and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to\ncustomers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n2024 Annual Report37\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 29, 2024 and December 31,\n2023.\nInnovative Medicine segment\nBalance at                         Payments/              Balance at\n(Dollars in Millions)            Beginning              Accruals    Credits(2)             End of\nof Period                                                 Period\n2024\nAccrued rebates(1)                           $14,661      52,786                -51,667                15,780\nAccrued returns                                  634         845                   -355                 1,124\nAccrued promotions                                 6           3                     -6                     3\nSubtotal                                     $15,301      53,634                -52,028                16,907\nReserve for doubtful accounts                     33          14                     -6                    41\nReserve for cash discounts                       111       1,493                 -1,495                   109\nTotal                                        $15,445      55,141                -53,529                17,057\n2023\nAccrued rebates(1)                           $12,289      47,523                -45,151                14,661\nAccrued returns                                  649         332                   -347                   634\nAccrued promotions                                 1          12                     -7                     6\nSubtotal                                     $12,939      47,867                -45,505                15,301\nReserve for doubtful accounts                     44           0                    -11                    33\nReserve for cash discounts                       110       1,386                 -1,385                   111\nTotal                                        $13,093      49,253                -46,901                15,445\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $187 million at December 29, 2024 and $165 million at December 31,\n2023, recorded as a contra asset.\n(2) Includes prior period adjustments\n38\nMedTech segment\nBalance at                Payments/    Balance at\n(Dollars in Millions)            Beginning of    Accruals      Credits        End of\nPeriod                                 Period\n2024\nAccrued rebates(1)                     $1,455       5,955       -5,986         1,424\nAccrued returns                           125         543         -550           118\nAccrued promotions                         25          62          -65            22\nSubtotal                               $1,605       6,560       -6,601         1,564\nReserve for doubtful accounts             133          31          -38           126\nReserve for cash discounts                  5          92          -91             6\nTotal                                  $1,743       6,683       -6,730         1,696\n2023\nAccrued rebates(1)                     $1,470       6,241       -6,256         1,455\nAccrued returns                           134         555         -564           125\nAccrued promotions                         43          74          -92            25\nSubtotal                               $1,647       6,870       -6,912         1,605\nReserve for doubtful accounts             125          33          -25           133\nReserve for cash discounts                  9          96         -100             5\nTotal                                  $1,781       6,999       -7,037         1,743\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $704 million at December 29, 2024 and $740 million at December 31,\n2023, recorded as a contra asset.\nIncome Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n2024 Annual Report39\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for\nthe two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total\nshareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on\nthe date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends,\nwhich are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total\nshareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 29, 2024.\n40\nEconomic and market factors\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2014 - 2024, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina, Venezuela, Turkey and Egypt (beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly\ninflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact\nto the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit\nmargins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nIRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates\nJanssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen\nis not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader\npharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies\nremains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs,\nimplementation of the program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of\nits summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\nRussia-Ukraine War\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was\nnot material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the business\nof the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues.\nThe Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation.\nIn March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare\npurposes.\nConflict in the Middle East\nAlthough the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was\nnot material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the business\nof the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented less than\n1% of revenues.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2024 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4 billion and net income by approximately $0.1\nbillion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and\nreimbursement of healthcare products.\n2024 Annual Report41\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2024, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which\na loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss\nbeyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments\nabout future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\nregarding legal proceedings.\nCommon stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 6, 2025,\nthere were 114,147 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.",

Consolidated Financial Statements\nAmounts presented for 2023 and 2022 have not been recast to exclude discontinued operations.\n2024 Annual Report49\nNotes to consolidated financial statements\n1. Summary of significant accounting policies\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the company\nThe Company has approximately 138,100employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries\nof the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nKenvue IPO/separation and discontinued operations\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of\n198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an initial public\noffering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the\nnet book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $ 2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in\ncapital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares\nof Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the\nnon-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was reflected in equity attributable to non-\ncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal second quarter of 2023.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of the shares of\nKenvue through an exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, the Company owned 9.5% of the shares of Kenvue\nwhich were accounted for as an equity investment carried at fair value within continuing operations. The historical\nresults of the Consumer Health business (which previously represented the Consumer Health business segment) are\nreflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of the\nexchange offer (see Note 21 for additional details). Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements refer only to Johnson & Johnson’s continuing operations.\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2024 the Company completed a debt for equity exchange of the retained stake in\nKenvue. Upon completion of the debt for equity exchange, the Company no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common\nStock.\nBusiness segments\nThe Company is organized into twobusiness segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. The Innovative Medicine\nsegment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology, Infectious Diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic. Products in this segment are distributed directly to\nretailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech\nsegment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Cardiovascular (previously\nreferred to as Interventional Solutions) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers,\nhospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care\nprofessionals and clinics.\nNew accounting standards\nRecently adopted accounting standards\nASU 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThe Company adopted the standard in the fiscal year 2024, which requires expanded annual and interim disclosures\nfor significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and included\nwithin each reported measure of segment profit or loss. The standard was applied retrospectively to all periods\npresented in the financial statements. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it did not have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. See Note 17 for the required disclosures.\n50\nRecently issued accounting standards\nNot adopted as of December 29, 2024\nASU 2024-03: Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic\n220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\nThis update requires disclosure of disaggregated information about certain income statement expense line items on\nan annual and interim basis. This update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and\ninterim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. As this\naccounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThis update standardizes categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, requires disaggregation of income\ntaxes and additional income tax-related disclosures. This update is required to be effective for the Company for\nfiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not\nhave a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAvailable-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets; otherwise, they\nare classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and\nequity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The\nCompany reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as\nrequired.\nProperty, plant and equipment and depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nBuilding and building equipment    30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\n2024 Annual Report51\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are\nnot available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30to 90days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for\nas variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued rebates,\nreturns, and promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates and discounts\nare estimated based on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected\nmarket conditions in the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from\nthe sale of the Company's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and\nMedicaid programs, which amounted to $ 12.3billion and $ 11.5billion as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023,\nrespectively. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the\nanalysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated\ninformation.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that have lost\npatent exclusivity, or that otherwise exhibit unusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other\nmarketing matters are specifically investigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the Company\ngenerally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted for in\naccordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns reserves\nare recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segment are almost exclusively not\nresalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not\nmaterial. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years\n2024, 2023 and 2022.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and\ninclude\nvolume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for\nthe incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the\nappropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share\npayments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-\nshare payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in the fiscal year 2024 and 2023, respectively, and less\nthan 3.0% of total revenues in the fiscal year 2022 and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 0.9billion, $ 0.9billion and $ 0.8billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023\nand 2022, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\n52\nIntangible assets and goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2024 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\nIn-process research and development purchased as part of a business combination is accounted for as an indefinite\nlived intangible asset until the underlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be\naccounted for as a definite lived intangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development\ncould be written off or partially impaired depending on the underlying program.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\nFinancial instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-\nbased measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,\nexclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to leases from continuing operations was $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion in\nfiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The lease liability from continuing operations was $ 1.2billion and $\n1.1billion in fiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively. The operating lease costs from continuing operations were $\n0.2billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease\nliabilities from continuing operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n2024 Annual Report53\nProduct liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when\nthose costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners\nrelated to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense\nbecause the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general,\nthe income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense other than the acquired in-process research & development expense of\n$ 1.25billion to secure the global rights to the NM26 bispecific antibody (Yellow Jersey acquisition) in fiscal\nyear 2024.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG, IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company and CARVYKTI, licensed and developed in collaboration with Legend Biotech USA\nInc. and Legend Biotech Ireland Limited.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\n54\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, were $ 0.6billion, $ 0.5billion and $ 0.7billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings\nin the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate\nof 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in fiscal year 2018 and\nwill continue through 2025. The final payment of $ 2.5billion will be made in fiscal year 2025.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to affect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $ 0.5billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\n2024 Annual Report55\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nSupplier finance program obligations\nThe Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions. These programs\nprovide participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment\ndates (which have general payment terms of 90days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to\nparticipate in the program.\nConfirmed obligations under the program as of December 29, 2024, and December 31, 2023, were $ 0.8billion and $\n0.7billion, respectively.

Fair value measurements\nThe Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows,\nprimarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of\nmaterials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company\nunder the CSA amounted to $ 2.2billion and $ 4.0billion net respectively, related to net investment and cash flow\nhedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-\nperformance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that\nhave at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions.\nAs of December 29, 2024, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross\ncurrency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 45.1billion, $ 40.5billion and $ 9.0billion,\nrespectively. As of December 31, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange\ncontracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $\n10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction. Cash exchanged\nfor derivatives is primarily in cash flows from operating activities.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the\nspot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in\noffsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge\naccounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2024 to 2044 as a net investment\nhedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of December 29, 2024, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income was $ 1.7billion after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward\nforeign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions\nthat are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging\ntransaction exposure is 18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount\nultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are\nultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\n60\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for

A debt-for-equity exchange was\ncompleted in the fiscal second quarter of 2024.\nOn May 15, 2024, the Company issued $ 3.6billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $\n3.6billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17, 2024, the Company completed a\nDebt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial\nPaper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged, and the\nCompany no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $\n0.4billion recorded in Other (income) expense.\nFor the fiscal years ended December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 for equity investments without readily\ndeterminable market values, $ 171million and $ 1million, respectively, of the changes in fair value reflected in\nnet income were the result of impairments. There were impacts of $ 26million and $ 27million, respectively, of\nchanges in the fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of\ninvestments.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\n2024 Annual Report63\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended\nDecember 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023 were as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts(2)\nTotal\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts\nInterest rate contracts(2)\nTotal                                                 Level 1    Level 2    Level 3    Total\nDerivatives not designated as hedging                 $—         660              —      660                539\ninstruments:                                          —          1,484            —    1,484                988\nAssets:                                               $—         2,144            —    2,144              1,527\nForward foreign exchange contracts                    —          794              —      794                624\nLiabilities:                                          —          3,753            —    3,753              5,338\nForward foreign exchange contracts                    $—         4,547            —    4,547              5,962\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:                 $—         50               —       50                 64\nEquity investments(3)                                 —          17               —       17                 75\nDebt securities(4)                                    451        —                —      451    2023      4,473\nOther Liabilities                               2024  —          7,216            —    7,216    Total(1)  8,874\nContingent Consideration(5)                           $                       1,217    1,217              1,092\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation      2024      2023\n(Dollars in Millions)\nTotal Gross Assets                        $2,194     1,591\nCredit Support Agreements (CSA)           -2,172    -1,575\nTotal Net Asset                               22        16\nTotal Gross Liabilities                    4,564     6,037\nCredit Support Agreements (CSA)           -4,412    -5,604\nTotal Net Liabilities                       $152       433\n64\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n2024     2023     2022\n(Dollars in Millions)\nBeginning Balance                  $1,092    1,120      533\nChanges in estimated fair value        88       29     -194\nAdditions(6)                          112        —      792\nPayments/Other                        -75      -57      -11\nEnding Balance(5)                  $1,217    1,092    1,120\n(1) 2023 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n4,473million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 1,092million, classified as Level\n3.\n(2) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(3) Classified as non-current other assets.\n(4) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(5) Includes $ 1,217million, $ 1,092million and $ 1,116million, classified as non-current other liabilities as of\nDecember 29, 2024,\nDecember 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively.

The\nprimary drivers of this change are discussed below.\nIn fiscal year 2024, The Company had more income in higher tax jurisdictions compared to fiscal year 2023,\nprimarily in the U.S. where the Company recorded a charge of approximately $ 5.1billion in the fiscal year of 2024\nversus approximately $ 7.0billion in the fiscal year of 2023, both for the talc matters in the United States. Both\ncharges were recorded at an effective U.S. tax rate of approximately 21% (for further information see Note 19 to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements).\nAdditionally in the fiscal year 2024, the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by legislative changes that\nwent into effect for Pillar Two in some of the Company's foreign jurisdictions which are reflected in International\noperations on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. Also in fiscal year 2024, the Company generated\nincremental U.S. foreign tax credits related to income sourced and taxed outside the United States and is reflected\nin U.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. In 2024, the Company\nfinalized multi-year transfer pricing agreements with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and certain other\nforeign jurisdictions. The U.S portion of the agreements were partially offset by the related tax adjustments in\nthe foreign jurisdictions which are reflected in U.S tax settlements and International operations, respectively, on\nthe Company’s effective rate reconciliation.\nThe fiscal year 2023 effective tax rate decreased 3.9% as compared to the fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate as\nthe Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2023 when compared to the prior\nfiscal year.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company settled the U.S. Internal Revenue Service audit for tax years\n2013 through 2016 which resulted in a favorable impact to the rate of 3.0%. This settlement was partially offset by\nthe Company recording a $ 0.4billion decrease in expected U.S. foreign tax credits, an unfavorable effective rate\nimpact of 2.6%, which has been reflected as a current tax expense in U.S. taxes on international income on the\nCompany’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Company had certain non-recurring impacts as a result of legislative tax elections\nmade in certain international subsidiaries which resulted in a change in the Company’s tax basis in certain assets\nresulting in deferred tax re-measurements. The net impact of these non-recurring items is a net benefit of 3.4% to\nthe Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following items:\napproximately $ 0.3billion of tax benefit on local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the\nincreased tax basis, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on the Company’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation. This benefit was offset by approximately $ 0.1billion of U.S. deferred tax expense on the\nGILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This has been reflected\nin the “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\n68\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax benefit on the GILTI deferred tax related to an election made by\nan international subsidiary resulting in a decrease in local deferred tax assets.

In certain jurisdictions, valuation allowances have been recorded against\ndeferred tax assets for loss carryforwards that are not more likely than not to be realized. The net operating loss\ncarryforwards for these international subsidiaries that do not have an indefinite carryforward period will begin to\nexpire in 2025 for various amounts.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to valuation allowances for continuing operations:\n(Dollars in Millions)             2024      2023\nBeginning of year               $1,149       775\nProvision                          451       355\nUtilization                          —      -116\nForeign currency translation       -46        25\nNet acquisitions /                  84       110\n(dispositions/liquidations)\nEnd of year                     $1,638    $1,149\n2024 Annual Report69\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to unrecognized tax benefits for continuing operations:\n(Dollars in Millions)                      2024     2023     2022\nBeginning of year                        $2,485    3,716    3,210\nIncreases related to current year tax       176      239      523\npositions\nIncreases related to prior period tax       129      244      143\npositions\nDecreases related to prior period tax      -147     -781     -148\npositions\nSettlements                                -583     -880       -1\nLapse of statute of limitations             -40      -53      -11\nEnd of year                              $2,020    2,485    3,716\nAs of December 29, 2024 the Company had approximately $ 2.0billion of unrecognized tax benefits. The Company\nconducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a\nnumber of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its\naudit for the tax years through 2016 and has commenced the audit for tax years 2017 through 2020. The Company\nrecently finalized multi-year transfer pricing agreements with the IRS and certain other foreign jurisdictions in\nthe fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audits go back\nto the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve\nmonths by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions. The Company anticipates a change in uncertain tax positions of\napproximately $ 200million in certain jurisdictions in the next twelve months due to the expected expiration of the\nstatute of limitations. However, generally the Company is not able to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the\ntiming of any other future tax payments, audit settlements, or changes in uncertain tax positions.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax\nexpense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 217million, $ 99million and $ 136million in fiscal\nyears 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 274million and $ 264million in\nfiscal years 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n9.

Pensions and other benefit plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S., non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2024 and 2023 the Company used December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively, as the measurement date\nfor all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2024,\n2023 and 2022 include the following components:\nRetirement Plans                                Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in                               2024      2023      2022                         2024    2023    2022\nMillions)\nService cost                              $948       893     1,319                          277     264     320\nInterest cost                            1,402     1,437       908                          209     214     104\nExpected return on                      -2,560    -2,716    -2,756                           -7      -7      -8\nplan assets\nAmortization of                           -184      -184      -184                           -2      -2      -5\nprior service cost\nRecognized\nactuarial losses                           174      -199       650                           53      23     122\n(gains)\nCurtailments and                            -2        93         1                            —      -5       —\nsettlements\nNet periodic\nbenefit cost                            $(222)      -676       -62                          530     487     533\n(credit)\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and Net earnings from\ndiscontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue. All other components of net periodic\nbenefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with\nthe exception of certain amounts for curtailments and settlements, which are reported in Net earnings from\ndiscontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue (as noted above).\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is\namortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan\namendment.\n2024 Annual Report71\nThe following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:\nRetirement                                             Other\nPlans                                           Benefit\nPlans\nWorldwide\nBenefit                      2024          2023          2022                  2024          2023          2022\nPlans\nNet\nPeriodic\nBenefit\nCost\nService\ncost                   4.39     %    4.85          2.46                  5.09          5.40          2.59\ndiscount\nrate\nInterest\ncost                   4.95     %    5.25          2.80                  5.12          5.43          2.64\ndiscount\nrate\nRate of\nincrease in            3.70     %    3.71          4.02                  4.22          4.22          4.21\ncompensati…\nlevels\nExpected\nlong-term\nrate of                7.25     %    7.21          7.25\nreturn on\nplan assets\nBenefit\nObligation\nDiscount               4.95     %    4.58          5.01                  5.54          5.11          5.42\nrate\nRate of\nincrease in            3.70     %    3.69          4.00                  4.22          4.22          4.21\ncompensati…\nlevels\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-\nterm fixed income instruments.

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets\nin the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\nOther assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are\nvalued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded\nare classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\n2024 Annual Report75\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2024 and\nDecember 31, 2023:\nQuo…\nPri…                                                              Inv…\nin                  Sig…                  Sig…                  Mea…\nAct…                  Oth…                  Uno…                  at\nMar…                  Obs…                  Inp…                  Net\nfor                  Inp…                                        Ass…\nIde…                                                              Val…\nAss…\n-Le…                  -Le…                  -Le…                                        To…\n1                  2                     3                                           As…\n(D…\nin           2024    2023          2024    2023          2024    2023          2024    2023         2024    20…\nMi…\nSh…\nin…      $—            12           511     829             —       —             —       —          511    841\nfu…\nGo…\nand             —       —          7,8…    5,9…             —       —             —       —         7,8…    5,…\nag…\nse…\nDe…             —       —          2,3…    3,8…             —       —             —       —         2,3…    3,…\nin…\nEq…          7,1…    7,7…             —       —             —       —             —       —         7,1…    7,…\nse…\nCo…             —       —          5,0…    4,9…            37      43          6,1…    6,6…         11,…    11…\nfu…\nOt…             —       —            88      49           128      92          4,0…    3,2…         4,3…    3,…\nas…\nIn…\nat     $7,…          7,7…          15,…    15,…           165     135          10,…    9,9…         33,…    33…\nfa…\nva…\n(1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\nThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 93million and $\n86million at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively.\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 13million at December 31, 2024\nand $ 14million at December 31, 2023.\n11.

International currency translation\nFor translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the\nlocal currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly\ninflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or\nmore during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency.\nFor the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.\nIn consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies (Argentina, Turkey and Venezuela). Beginning in the\nfiscal fourth quarter of 2024, the Company also accounted for operations in Egypt as highly inflationary. The\ntranslation of balance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 for foreign currency translation adjustments\nis included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 214million, $\n366million and $ 286million in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n78\n15.

Common stock, stock option plans and stock compensation agreements\nAt December 29, 2024, the Company had oneactive stock-based compensation plan, the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\nThe shares outstanding are for contracts under the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and 2022 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted\nshares units and performance share units) granted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive\nPlan. Under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 150million shares of common stock, of\nwhich up to 110million shares of common stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights\nand up to 40million shares of common stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be\ncounted on a 1-for-1 basis against the share reserve, provided that if more than 40million full value awards are\ngranted, each full value award in excess of 40million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve.\nShares available for future grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 111million at the end of fiscal\nyear 2024.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,176million, $ 1,087million and $\n1,028million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 251million, $ 221million and $ 177million for fiscal\nyears 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $ 94million,\n$ 126million and $ 267million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, for which options were exercised\nor restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 1,002million, $ 907million and $\n866million for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be\nrecognized was 1.81years, 1.80years and 1.80years for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. Share-based\ncompensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\n2024 Annual Report79\nStock options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years. Options granted under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted at the average of the high and low\nprices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Options granted under the\n2022 Long-Term incentive Plan were granted at the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock\nExchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2024, 2023, and 2022 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe average fair value of options granted was $ 27.67, $ 27.85and $ 23.23, in fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:\n2024           2023           2022\nRisk-free rate               4.15     %     3.74     %     1.98     %\nExpected volatility         17.85     %    17.69     %    18.00     %\nExpected life (in years)            7.0            7.0            7.0\nExpected dividend yield      3.10     %     2.90     %     2.70     %\nA summary of option activity under the Plan as of December 29, 2024, is presented below:\nWeighted                Aggregate\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding    Average Exercise                Intrinsic\nShares               Price                    Value\n(Dollars in Millions)\nShares at December 31, 2023        112,238             $139.88                   $2,239\nOptions granted                     13,917              157.92\nOptions exercised                  -10,771              107.06\nOptions canceled/forfeited          -2,755              162.45\nShares at December 29, 2024        112,629             $144.69                   $1,129\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 560million, $ 729million and $ 1,228million in fiscal years\n2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n80\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 29, 2024:\n(Shares in     Outstanding                                                  Exercisable\nThousands)\nWeighted                               Weighted\nExercise                    Options    Average                   Average                 Options        Average\nPrice Range                            Life(1)                  Exercise                               Exercise\nPrice                                  Price\n$100.06-                     13,016                  0.8         $101.29                  13,016        $101.29\n$101.87\n$115.67-                     18,252                  2.6          122.49                  18,252         122.49\n$129.51\n$131.94-                     25,624                  4.6          142.87                  25,624         142.87\n$151.41\n$157.92-                     26,391                  8.6          160.33                   4,269         162.75\n$162.75\n$164.62-                     29,346                  6.6          165.29                  13,522         164.64\n$165.89\n112,629                  5.3         $144.69                  74,683        $135.72\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023 were 112,238and an average life of 5.5years and\n118,672and an average life of 5.8years, respectively.

The\nCompany also grants performance share units, which are paid in shares of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock after the\nend of a three-yearperformance period. Performance shares were granted with two equally-weighted goals that\ndirectly align with or help drive long-term total shareholder return: adjusted operational earnings per share and\nrelative total shareholder return.

(Nasdaq: ITCI), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and\ncommercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system (CNS) disorders, for $ 132.00per share in cash for a\ntotal equity value of approximately $ 14.6billion. The Company expects to fund the transaction through a\ncombination of cash on hand and debt. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur later this year subject\nto applicable regulatory approvals, approval by Intra-Cellular Therapies’ stockholders and other customary closing\nconditions for a transaction of this type. The results of operations will be included in the Innovative Medicine\nsegment beginning on the acquisition date.\nBusiness combinations\nAcquisitions of a business are accounted for as business combinations applying the acquisition method of\naccounting. Under this method, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair\nvalues as of the acquisition date in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the fair value of the acquired net assets, where applicable, is recorded as goodwill. The results of\noperations of these acquisitions have been included in the Company’s financial statements from their respective\ndates of acquisition.\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, certain businesses were acquired for $ 15.1billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal\nyear 2024 acquisitions primarily included; Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., Shockwave Medical Inc., and Proteologix, Inc. The\nremaining acquisitions were not material.\nOn June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix, Inc., a privately held biotechnology\ncompany focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, for approximately $ 0.8billion net of cash\nacquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment. The results of operations are included in the\nInnovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets\nacquired of $ 1.2billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $\n0.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion, and $ 0.3billion of liabilities assumed which included $ 0.1billion related\nto a contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation\nadjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 30% to 45% was used in the\nfair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied\nwas approximately 16%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business\nacquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the\nfiscal 2024 were notmaterial.\nOn May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Shockwave Medical Inc. (SWAV)(Shockwave), a leading,\nfirst-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the treatment of calcified\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in an all-cash merger transaction.

The\namortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market CAD and PAD IVL products with the\naverage weighted lives of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products.\nThe value of the IPR&D was calculated using a probability-adjusted cash flow projection discounted for the risk\ninherent in such projects with the weighted average probability of success factors of approximately 50%. The\ndiscount rate applied was 9.0%.\nOn March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a clinical-stage\nbiopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-\ngeneration antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of\napproximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.8billion net of cash acquired.

A probability of success factor ranging from 40% to\n2024 Annual Report91\n70% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The\ndiscount rate applied was approximately 17%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise\nfrom the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs\nbefore tax for the fiscal year 2024 were not material.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business combination.\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $ 17.7billion, net of cash acquired. The fiscal\nyear 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not material.\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of\ncardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and\nheart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens\nthe Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and\nrecovery, one of healthcare’s largest areas of unmet need. The results of operations were included in the MedTech\nsegment as of the date of the acquisition. The acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding\nshares. The consideration paid in the acquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00per share in cash,\namounting to $ 17.1billion, net of cash acquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”)\nentitling the holder to receive up to $ 35.00per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately\n$ 1.6billion in the aggregate) if certain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding\nenterprise value (without taking into account the CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5billion includes cash, cash\nequivalents and marketable securities acquired.\nThe milestones of the CVR consist of:\na. $ 17.50per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7billion during Johnson & Johnson’s\nfiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this\nperiod and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal\nfirst quarter of 2029, $ 8.75per share;\nb. $ 7.50per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella® products in ST-elevated\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\nc. $ 10.00per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella® products\nin high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical\nendpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In fiscal 2023,\nthere were purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $ 0.2billion with an offsetting increase\nto goodwill.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio\nand is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other\nLiabilities and adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2024 on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella® platform\nwith an average weighted life of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved\nproducts. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the\nrisk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied\nwas 9.5%.\nIn the fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately\n$ 0.3billion, $ 0.2billion and $ 0.3billion, which was primarily recorded in Other (income)/expense.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022 is not provided, as the impact of the\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.\n92\nAsset acquisitions\nAcquired In-process research and development (IPR&D) in an asset acquisition is immediately expensed as research\nand development expense in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Milestone payments incurred prior to\nregulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense when the milestone event occurs.\nThe fiscal year 2024 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included V-Wave Ltd. and the global\nrights to the NM26 bispecific antibody (Yellow Jersey acquisition). The remaining activity was not material.\nOn October 8, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of V-Wave Ltd, a privately-held company focused on\ndeveloping innovative treatment options for patients with heart failure, for an upfront payment of $ 0.6billion,\nwith the potential for additional regulatory and commercial milestone payments up to approximately $ 1.1billion.\nThe Company recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $ 0.5billion, net of a gain recorded on the Company's\nexisting investment in V-Wave and the results of operations are included in the MedTech segment as of the\nacquisition date.\nOn July 11, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Yellow Jersey, a demerged subsidiary of Numab\nTherapeutics AG, to secure the global rights to NM26, a novel, investigational first-in-class bispecific antibody\ntargeting two clinically proven pathways in atopic dermatitis (AD), in an all-cash transaction for approximately $\n1.25billion. The Company recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $ 1.25billion, and the results of operations are\nincluded in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date.\nThe fiscal year 2023 asset acquisitions expensed as research and development included Laminar Inc. The remaining\nactivity was not material.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of Laminar Inc., a privately-held medical device\ncompany focused on eliminating the left atrial appendage (LAA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation\n(AFib), for an upfront payment of $ 0.4billion. The Company recorded an IPR&D charge of approximately $ 0.4billion\nand the results of operations are included in the MedTech segment as of the acquisition date.\nThere were no significant asset acquisitions in 2022.\nDivestitures\nDuring the fiscal year 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Acclarent resulting in approximately $\n0.3billion in proceeds and the divestiture of Ponvory outside of the U.S. resulting in approximately $ 0.2billion\nin proceeds. All other divestitures were not material.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds\nresulting in gains or losses that were not material. At fiscal year end 2023, the Company held assets, primarily\nintangibles, on its Consolidated Balance Sheet of approximately $ 0.3billion, primarily related to Acclarent and\nPonvory, that were subsequently divested in fiscal 2024.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did notmake any material divestitures.\n19. Legal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 29, 2024, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of\n2024 Annual Report93\npotential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and\ncounterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the\nCompany and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have\nbeen verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson,\net al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the\ncase to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a\nreview of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the\naward, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the\nterms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the\nCompany. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that\nit has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain\ncircumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the\nMississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’\nuse of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The\nCompany has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its\ntalcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group\nof state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements\nwere finalized.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against\nLTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance\ncompanies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to\nthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL\nBankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in\nMarch 2022.\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\nBankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\n94\nIn April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy\nCase). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to\nsection 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining\norder staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other\nparties (the New Protected Parties).\nAlso in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the\nCompany and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained\nin force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary\nInjunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for those cases filed in the federal court\novarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted\nto proceed.\nFurthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed\nby similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023,\nthe court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the\ndecision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October\n2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. In July 2024, the Third Circuit issued a non-\nprecedential opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy case.\nIn October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to\nachieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision;\n(ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its\ndismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative\nclaims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products. In\nDecember 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC (\"LLT\").\nFollowing the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were\nreactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a\nmulti-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL,\ncase-specific discovery proceeded. The MDL proceedings have been stayed by order of the bankruptcy court in the Red\nRiver Bankruptcy case discussed below. In March 2024, the court granted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert\nhearing prior to the trial. The briefing on the renewed Daubert issues was completed in August 2024.\nIn May 2024, the Company commenced a three-monthsolicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged”\nChapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the “Proposed Plan”) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and\nfuture claims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State\nconsumer protection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $\n6.475billion payable over 25years (nominal value of approximately $ 8.0billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The\nclaims encompassed by the Proposed Plan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its\ntalc powder products.\nIn August 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited liability\ncompanies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (\"Red River\"); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (\"Pecos River\"); and (3) New Holdco\n(Texas) LLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were\nseparated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated\nto Pecos River.\nIn September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red\nRiver filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas,\nseeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the\nCompany's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Red River also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,\nseeking to extend the automatic stay to additional non-debtor entities. Prior to filing, the initial proposed plan\nwas amended to, among other things, increase the proposed resolution by $ 1.75billion.\n2024 Annual Report95\nShortly after Red River filed its Chapter 11 petition, the U.S. Trustee's office filed a motion to transfer venue\nin the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter, a motion to transfer venue and a motion to dismiss in the Texas\nBankruptcy Court. A coalition of six plaintiff law firms also filed a motion to transfer venue and a motion to\ndismiss in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. In September 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary order\nenjoining the commencement or prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities,\nincluding the Company, until October 11, 2024. The temporary order was extended in October 2024 and again in\nDecember 2024. The commencement and prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities are\ncurrently enjoined until March 15, 2025. Also in September 2024, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied the U.S.\nTrustee's motion to transfer venue without prejudice. In October 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court denied the motion\nto transfer venue from Texas to New Jersey Bankruptcy Court. A consolidated hearing to address, among other things,\nthe motions to dismiss and plan confirmation is currently scheduled to begin on February 18, 2025.\nMesothelioma and State consumer protection claims are being addressed outside the Proposed Plan. The Company\nseparately has resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date and has resolved the State claims.\nTo account for these settlements and the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the\nCompany recorded a cumulative incremental charge of approximately $ 5.0billion, through the fourth fiscal quarter\n2024. As of December 29, 2024, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $ 11.6billion (or nominal\nvalue of approximately $ 13.5billion), net of payments made in fiscal 2024. Approximately ten percent of the\nreserve is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable\nloss.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nChapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury\nfrom exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company\nfor indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a Chapter 11 plan\n(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its\nalleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust\nwould pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification\nfrom the Company.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus\nPlan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary\ncontribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims\nasserted against it and certain affiliated parties. Cyprus also asserts it has claims for indemnity against the\nCompany arising out of talc personal injury claims. Under the Cyprus Plan, Cyprus would also contribute its alleged\nindemnification rights to the trust.\nIn September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar\nconstruct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain\nother protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights\nagainst the Company. The Company opposed both plans on the basis that the plans inflated Imerys’s and Cyprus’s\nliability for talc claims and had the potential effect of imposing those inflated liabilities on the Company\nthrough the Company’s alleged indemnification obligations.\nIn July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent entities),\nand the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in their respective Chapter 11\ncases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement Agreement) to resolve their ongoing\ndisputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus bankruptcies. In August 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed\namended Chapter 11 plans and disclosure statements incorporating the terms of the settlement with the Company. In\nOctober 2024, the Imerys Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Imerys Settlement Agreement (the\nSettlement Order). The effectiveness of certain provisions of the settlement, including mutual releases, are\nsubject to certain conditions, including the Imerys and Cyprus Plans being accepted by a sufficient number and\namount of voting creditors to be confirmed under the Bankruptcy Code. Certain insurers have appealed the Settlement\nOrder and sought a stay of the order pending appeal, which the Court denied on January 13, 2025. The briefing of\nthe appeal in the District Court is scheduled to be completed in April 2025. On January 5, 2025, Imerys and Cyprus\neach filed a certification of voting results, indicating that their respective plan had been accepted by each\nvoting class of creditors. A joint confirmation hearing for the plans is scheduled for April 2025.\n96\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. The\ncase was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the\nCourt granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the\nThird Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class\ncertification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In February 2024, fact\ndiscovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending mediation. In May 2024, the\nparties participated in an unsuccessful mediation. In June 2024, at the parties' request, the Court lifted the stay\nfor certain limited discovery, but otherwise kept the stay in place pending a decision from the Third Circuit on\nthe 23(f) petition. Briefing on the 23(f) petition was completed in September 2024. In January 2025, the Third\nCircuit listed the appeal for oral argument in March 2025.\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and\norganizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims for up\nto $ 5.0billion. Approximately 70% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal fourth quarter 2024. A\nfew government entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve\nthe hospital cases.\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants. In total, there are approximately 35 remaining opioid cases against the\nCompany and JPI in various state courts, 390 remaining cases in the Ohio multi-district litigation (MDL), and 4\nadditional cases in other federal courts.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada. That action was certified as an opt in class action on behalf of\nother provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada in January 2025. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on\nbehalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed\nclass action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against\nJanssen Inc. and other industry members in April 2024; and leave to appeal was denied in October 2024.\nStarting in November 2019, a series of shareholder derivative complaints were filed against the Company as the\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\nCompany has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. As of September 2024, all the complaints had\nbeen dismissed, and all appeals exhausted.\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each\nrelated legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to\ndefend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the\nCompany has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other\nlosses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the\nworld, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be\nrequired in the future as additional information becomes available.\n2024 Annual Report97\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of December 29, 2024:\nProduct or product category                                  Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S    62,830\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip         60\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                          910\nPelvic meshes                                         5,990\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh              130\nRISPERDAL                                                 7\nELMIRON                                               2,170\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland,\nIndia and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers\nrepresenting ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the\nUnited States. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution\nsignificant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and\nthe settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The Company continues to receive\ninformation with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The\nCompany has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-\nrelated product liability litigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established\na United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have\nbeen settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\nAcetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\n98\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nand Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The vast majority of these actions\nare now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with\nEthicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed\nfor Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In\nMay 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately\n3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master\nsettlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other\nthan a small number of cases still pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been\nresolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed\npending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject\nto docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon\nPhysiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nInnovative Medicine\nRISPERDAL\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the\nuse of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. The Company continues to defend RISPERDAL product liability lawsuits, and continues to\nevaluate potential costs related to those claims. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but\nthere have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive\ndamages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021,\nthe Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in\nsubstantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other\nsettlements are reflected in the Company's accruals.\nELMIRON\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New\n2024 Annual Report99\nJersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated\nin a multi-county litigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have\nbeen coordinated and granted mass tort designation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in\nCanada. The Company continues to defend ELMIRON product liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential\ncosts related to those claims. All U.S. based ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are undergoing formal review\nfor purposes of settlement. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with\nELMIRON related product liability litigation.\nIntellectual property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that\ncertain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these\nsubsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all\nsignificant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases\ncould adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to\nloss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash\nimpairment charge for any associated intangible asset.\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication\n“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of\nthese lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic\nversion of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court\nrulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce\ngeneric versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and\nrevenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\nintangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and\nsuch settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to\nthe expiration of the relevant patents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents.

Subsequent changes are\nreflected in other income/expense and amounted to $ 0.4billion expense through December 31, 2023.\nJohnson & Johnson divested net assets of $ 11.6billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $ 4.3billion. Additionally, at the\ndate of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $ 1.2billion to record the\ndeconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a non-cash gain on the exchange offer of $ 21.0billion that was\nrecorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for\nthe fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $ 2.8billion on the Kenvue Common Stock\nretained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the exchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal\nincome tax purposes.\nAlso in connection with the separation, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into a separation agreement and also\nentered into various other agreements that provide for certain transactions to effect the transfer of the assets\nand liabilities of the Consumer Health business to Kenvue and to govern various interim and ongoing relationships\nbetween Kenvue and Johnson & Johnson following the completion of the Kenvue IPO, including transition services\nagreements (TSAs), transition manufacturing agreements (TMAs), trademark agreements, intellectual property\nagreements, an employee matters agreement, and a tax matters agreement. Under the TSAs, Johnson & Johnson will\nprovide Kenvue various services and, similarly, Kenvue will provide Johnson & Johnson various services. The\nprovision of services under the TSAs generally will terminate within 24months following the Kenvue IPO.\nAdditionally, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into TMAs pursuant to which Johnson & Johnson will manufacture\nand supply to Kenvue certain products and, similarly, Kenvue will manufacture and supply to Johnson & Johnson\ncertain products. The terms of the TMAs range in initial duration from 3months to 5years.\nAmounts related to the TSAs and TMAs included in the consolidated statements of earnings were immaterial for both\nfiscal years 2024 and 2023. Additionally, the amounts due to and from Kenvue for the above agreements was not\nmaterial as of December 31, 2023.\nThe results of the Consumer Health business (previously reported as a separate business segment), as well as the\nassociated gain, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of\nearnings as Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. As a result of the separation of Kenvue,\nJohnson & Johnson incurred separation costs of $ 145million in the fiscal year 2024, which was included in Net\nEarnings and incurred separation costs of $ 986million and $ 1,089million in the fiscal years 2023 and 2022,\nrespectively, which were included in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. These costs were\nprimarily related to external advisory, legal, accounting, contractor and other\n2024 Annual Report105\nincremental costs directly related to separation activities. In the fiscal 2022, as part of the planned separation\nof the Company’s Consumer Health business, the Company recognized approximately $ 0.5billion in net incremental tax\ncosts.\nDetails of Net Earnings from Discontinued Operations, net of taxes are as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)                    2023(1)               2022\nSales to customers                                $10,036    14,953\nCost of products sold                               4,369     6,494\nGross profit                                        5,667     8,459\nSelling, marketing and administrative               3,085     4,519\nexpenses\nResearch and development expense                      258       468\nInterest Income                                      -117         —\nInterest expense, net of portion                      199         —\ncapitalized\nOther (income) expense, net                         1,092     1,060\n(Gain) on separation of Kenvue                    -20,984         —\nRestructuring                                           —        46\nEarnings from Discontinued Operations              22,134     2,366\nBefore Provision for Taxes on Income\nProvision for taxes on income                         307       795\nNet earnings from Discontinued                    $21,827     1,571\nOperations\n(1) The Company ceased consolidating the results of the Consumer Health business on August 23, 2023, the date of\nthe exchange offer, but continued to reflect any separation costs incurred as part of discontinued operations\nthrough the end of the fiscal fourth quarter.\nThe following table presents depreciation, amortization and capital expenditures of the discontinued operations\nrelated to Kenvue:\n(Dollars in Millions)            2023(1)          2022\nDepreciation and Amortization             $383     641\nCapital expenditures                      $162     303\n106\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of\ncomprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December\n29, 2024, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We\nalso have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 29, 2024 and December 31, 2023, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 29, 2024 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s report on internal control over financial reporting, management has excluded Shockwave\nMedical, Inc., (“Shockwave”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 29,\n2024 because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2024. We have also excluded\nShockwave from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Shockwave is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose\ntotal assets and total sales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial\nreporting represent less than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the\nfiscal year ended December 29, 2024.\n2024 Annual Report107\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Innovative Medicine Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued rebates, returns, and promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical products within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $12.3 billion as of\nDecember 29, 2024. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nrebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical\nexperience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the various markets served.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. Innovative Medicine\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment\nby management due to the significant measurement uncertainty when developing the estimate of these reserves and\n(ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating the\nassumptions related to contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected\nmarket conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s estimate of the U.S. Innovative Medicine rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare\nand Medicaid, including controls over the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also\nincluded, among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information\non price and market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and\nthe historical experience and trend analysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing, on a sample basis, rebate\nclaims processed by the Company, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual and\nmandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and (iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s\nestimates to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates.\n108\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the\nCompany has settled cases. In May 2024, the Company proposed a consensual “prepackaged” Chapter 11 bankruptcy plan\n(the “Proposed Plan”) for the final resolution of all current and future claims related to cosmetic talc in the\nUnited States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims. In September 2024, the\nCompany’s subsidiary Red River Talc, LLC filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the\nBankruptcy Code, in furtherance of the Company’s consensual “prepackaged” Proposed Plan. As of December 29, 2024,\nthe total present value of the reserve to resolve the talc claims is approximately $11.6 billion, of which\napproximately ten percent is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best\nestimate of probable loss. The Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts\naccrued.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the litigation\ncontingencies - talc is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when assessing the\nlikelihood of a loss being incurred for the remaining unresolved talc claims, when determining whether a reasonable\nestimate of the loss or range of loss for the remaining unresolved talc claims can be made, and when determining\nthe timing of settlement payments for the remaining unresolved talc claims, and (ii) a high degree of auditor\njudgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s\nassessment of the loss contingencies associated with the talc litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s assessment of the litigation contingencies – talc, including controls over\ndetermining whether a loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as\nfinancial statement disclosures. These procedures also included, among others (i) gaining an understanding of the\nCompany’s process around the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) obtaining and evaluating\ncertain executed settlement agreements related to the talc litigation; (iii) discussing the status of significant\nknown actual and potential litigation and settlements activity with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well\nas external counsel when deemed necessary; (iv) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal\nand external legal counsel related to the talc litigation; (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (vi) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 13, 2025\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n2024 Annual Report109\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 29, 2024. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Company acquired Shockwave Medical, Inc. (Shockwave), in a business combination in May 2024. Shockwave’s total\nassets, excluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less than 1% of each of the related\nconsolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2024. As the acquisition\noccurred in the fiscal year 2024, the scope of the Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2024 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion\nis in accordance with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted\nfrom the scope in the year of acquisition.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December\n29, 2024, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2024 has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report,\nwhich appears herein.\n/s/J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and\nparticipated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nReports on internal control over financial reporting.

The Company continues to\nmonitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting.
