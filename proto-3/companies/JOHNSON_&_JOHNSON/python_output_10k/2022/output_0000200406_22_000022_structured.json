          "content": "BUSINESS\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field.

These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and\nused predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nBeginning in the fiscal first quarter of 2022, the Medical Devices segment will be referred to as the MedTech\nsegment.\nGeographic Areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 141,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of\nBusiness – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– Medical Devices.” However, the principal markets, products\nand methods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold\nin international business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. Significant legal proceedings and\n2\nclaims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—\nIntellectual Property” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA ® (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 9.7% of the Company's\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the\nCompany. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related\nto STELARA ® . The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring\nEuropean composition of matter patent expires in 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO ®\n(daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 6.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal\n2021. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns\ntwo patent families related to DARZALEX ® , and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent\nfamilies. The two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European\npatent expires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO ® .\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has been heavier in the\nfourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally for\nadvertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the\nCompany’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company\nbelieves that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital\nexpenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state\nagencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The\nexercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in\nincreases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a\ncorresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets\noutside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the new privacy regulations in Europe and in\nother countries are examples of such increased regulation.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or\nmedical\n3\ndevices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize\nadulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to\ngrant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports,\nand/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of\nsubstantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our\nofficers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain\nconduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively\nmarketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result\nin a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in\ndifferent countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and congress on drug prices and profits and programs that encourage doctors to write\nprescriptions for particular drugs, or to recommend, use or purchase particular medical devices. Laws and\nregulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent fraud and abuse in\nthe healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships between healthcare\ncompanies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require disclosures of payments and\nother transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with disclosures in 2022, to\ncertain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international business practices require\nstrict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to payments to any foreign\ngovernment official. Payers have become a more potent force in the market place and increased attention is being\npaid to drug and medical device pricing, appropriate drug and medical device utilization and the quality and costs\nof healthcare generally.\nU.S. government actors continue efforts to repeal, modify, or invalidate provisions of the Patient Protection and\nAffordable Care Act (the ACA) which passed in 2010. For example, federal legislation repealed the ACA’s individual\nmandate tax penalty as well as the tax on generous employer-sponsored healthcare plans; the Center for Medicare &\nMedicaid Services (CMS) began permitting states to impose work requirements on persons covered by Medicaid\nexpansion plans; certain federal subsidies to insurers have ended; and certain short-term insurance plans not\noffering the full array of ACA benefits have been allowed to extend in duration. Some of these changes are being\nchallenged in U.S. courts and so their long-term impact remains uncertain. The ACA has also been subject to\njudicial challenge. In November 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court heard argument in Texas v. Azar , which challenges the\nconstitutionality of the ACA. Pending resolution of the litigation, all of the ACA but the individual mandate to\nbuy health insurance remains in effect. The U.S. government also continues to propose and implement changes to the\nMedicare Part D benefit including the size of manufacturer discounts in the coverage gap and catastrophic phases of\nthe benefit. There are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the\nstate level that would affect drug pricing in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing federal landscape\nhas both positive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how\nvarious provisions of federal law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nare subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the\nCompany's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\nThe global regulatory landscape is also subject to change as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect the U.S. and\nglobal economies. The U.S. FDA and other health authorities have shifted resources and priorities to meet the many\nchallenges presented by the pandemic. Pandemic-related disruptions could negatively impact the processing of\nregulatory submissions and slow agency review times necessary for the approval or clearance of new drugs and\ndevices. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic is unpredictable and difficult to assess.\n4\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the number of employees were approximately:\n2021       2020\nEmployees1                               144,300    136,400\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2    141,700    134,500\n1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and\ninclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed\nboth professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and Employee Engagement\nAt Johnson & Johnson, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to\npatients, consumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees\nworldwide are further guided by the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements for business\nconduct and serves as a foundation for the Company policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide\nadditional guidance on expected employee behaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global\nsurveys that offer its employees the ability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential\nhuman resources risks and identify opportunities to improve. In 2021, 91% of global employees across 77 countries\nparticipated in Our Voice Survey which was offered in 36 languages.\nGrowth and Development\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and\nretain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and\nbe provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs\nand educational resources\n5\n5\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each\nperson’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term\nstrategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for\neveryone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2021, 45.8% of employees in Manager and above\njob categories took advantage of career opportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines\n(including upward promotion or lateral transfer and excluding employees in the research and development\norganizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 8%.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity\nand inclusion. Enabling employees to perform at their best while being themselves is fundamental to the Company's\ncontinued success. The Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI strategy focuses\non three pillars that reflect the strategic priorities identified to enable the Company to address the challenges\nand opportunities presented by this evolving understanding of diversity:\nAccelerate the Company’s efforts to advance a culture of inclusion and innovation\nBuild a diverse workforce for the future\nEnhance business results and reputation\nThe Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\nemployee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same\neverywhere.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and\nbenefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where\npossible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' financial,\nphysical, and mental well-being, including annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement\nsavings programs, health and welfare benefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee\nassistance programs.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors\nto the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs\nthroughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings\nbest-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company\nadvances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—help ensure employee health protection from\nemerging health risks.\nSafety and COVID-19 Pandemic Response\nProtecting and supporting our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a top priority and our\napproach includes: keeping employees informed of local COVID-19 transmission rates and corresponding risk levels;\npromoting the health and safety of our employees in the workplace through robust layers of protection; enhanced\ncleaning and access to cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment; supporting employees with pay\ncontinuity, benefits and well-being tools; and recognizing extraordinary employee contributions at work and in our\ncommunities. In 2021, in recognition of the new way of working, we initiated J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers\nour office-based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in-person and remote work. This model\nallows for work to happen seamlessly across a variety of workplaces and is enabled by an array of enhanced\ncollaboration tools and technology to optimize productivity and connection. J&J Flex rolled out in fourth quarter\n2021 globally, and will continue deployment through 2022 as protocol and requirements related to the COVID-19\npandemic allow. The Company is evaluating flexible work strategies for its on-site workforce, such as virtual on-\nboarding and training, to help our employees balance their personal and professional lives. Also, we continued to\nenhance our benefits offerings with access to wellness tools, on-site vaccine clinics, mental health support\nresources and delivery of at-home testing kits. In addition, as COVID-19 vaccines were broadly distributed and\nadministered in 2021, including the one developed by Johnson & Johnson, we adopted policies in the U.S., Puerto\nRico, and certain other countries to require proof of vaccination from Johnson & Johnson employees and contingent\nworkers, in order to return to our sites, where permitted by local law and regulation. In the U.S. and Puerto Rico,\nthis requirement took effect on October 4, 2021, with processes established for granting accommodations to those\nwith medical or religious needs. Select manufacturing and distribution employees and contractors in the U.S. and\nPuerto Rico, as well as certain additional countries, are adopting similar policies through early 2022.\n6\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com .

          "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development.\nFor the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and\nenter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the\nCompany’s Medical Devices businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service\nare especially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes\nand technologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\nobsolete. The Company’s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and\nretailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name\nconsumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 85 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other\nsevere weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such\ndelays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact\nas well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party\nmanufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party\nmanufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce\nproducts of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a\ntimely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be\nable to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an\nadverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the\nthird party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual\nproperty, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third\nparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that\nis costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to\nfacilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties,\nis unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the\nCompany may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the\n8\nCompany would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays\nand increased costs which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted certain aspects of the Company’s business and could cause disruptions\nor future impact to the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics and pandemics, including the global\noutbreak of coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and is expected\nto continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial\ncondition, including lower sales and reduced customer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of\nCOVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including instituting remote work for many of the\nCompany’s employees), and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as\nthe Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners. The\nCompany continues to monitor the situation and while we have robust business continuity plans in place across our\nglobal supply chain network to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19, these efforts may not completely prevent our\nbusiness from being adversely affected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have begun or will begin to reopen their economies, the extent to which COVID-19\nwill impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be predicted with confidence,\nincluding the duration of the outbreak and impact of variants. Any resurgence in COVID-19 could result in the\nimposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented in order to control the spread of the\ndisease. The continued global spread of COVID-19 could adversely impact the Company’s operations, including, among\nother things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, including third-party suppliers, sales and marketing and\nclinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial results,\nand global economic conditions generally.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our COVID-19 vaccine, including uncertainties related to the risk that our\ncontinued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from regulatory\nauthorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its efficacy,\nsafety and durability; the risk that data are subject to differing interpretations and assessments, including\nduring the peer review/publication process, in the scientific community generally, and by national immunization\ntechnical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory authorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our\nthird-party suppliers and external manufacturers; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive\nproducts; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the\navailability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs\nassociated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or\nprovide additional research funding for potential drug development related to COVID-19; the risk that we may not be\nable to create or scale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience\nmanufacturing delays once a manufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels\ncommensurate with global demand for any potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively\nimpact our ability to supply the estimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods\nindicated, and other challenges and risks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing\nand access challenges for such products, including in the U.S.\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also\nhave the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section and those\nincorporated by reference herein, i ncluding risks relating to the Company’s effective tax rate as a result of\nchanges in consumption as well as changes in laws relating to supply of the Company’s products . Given that\ndevelopments concerning the COVID-19 pandemic have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may\narise, including litigation, that are not presently known to the Company.\n9\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare\nreforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices products are significantly affected by reimbursements by\nthird-party payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations.\nAs part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at\nwhich products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, increased political scrutiny could result in\nadditional pricing pressures. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and\nChina, have pervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly\nimpose price controls, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its\nintellectual property protection.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes\nit has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The\nCompany could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these\nmatters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally\nliable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any\nreporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for\nthat period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a\nwholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\nwhether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other\ncountries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage.\nThese circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s\nproducts. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and\ninspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines,\nsignificant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and\nlegal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates.\nRegulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality\nregulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and\npenalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and\nlitigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation,\ninvestigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate\nProgram, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws.\nScrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S.,\nand any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties\nincluding, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant\ncurrent investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal\nProceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport.\n10\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and results of\noperations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nSee Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report\nfor additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose\nmore information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\nprofits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on\ntax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\nreserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of\nthird parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely\naffect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products\nmay challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and\nInnovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of\nbiosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk”\nlaunch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the\nreferenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and\nother intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and\nindications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful\n11\nproducts and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing products lose\nmarket share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products introduced\nwithin the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2021 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or\nwhether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether\nparticular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be\ncommercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers\nor uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product\ncan be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\nmarket entry of competitive products.\nRisks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting\nbusiness internationally .\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2021, approximately 50% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 19% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. The Company has accounted for operations in Argentina and Venezuela\nas highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. While the Company strives\nto maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic\nprice increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of continued inflation. In addition, the impact\nof currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange\nfluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities;\n12\ntherefore, the Company’s interactions with these prescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the\nFCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and enforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company\noperates have laws and regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt\nand anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional\nadministrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal\nsanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\ninclude:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates,\nmonetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other\nlimitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing\nrequirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing\ncosts and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business\nThe planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline\ncurrently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the\nintention to create a new, publicly traded company. The planned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free\ntransaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation in\n18 to 24 months after initial announcement. Completion of the planned separation will be subject to the\nsatisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and other employee\nrepresentative bodies, as required, final approval of the Company’s Board of Directors, receipt of a favorable\nopinion and Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) ruling with respect to the tax-free nature of the transaction, and the\nreceipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of the planned\nseparation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise\nadversely affect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general or financial market\nconditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or clearances.\nThe costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve\nsome or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the\nCompany’s Consumer Health business.\nThe Company will incur significant expenses in connection with the planned separation. In addition, the Company may\nnot be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from the planned\nseparation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which\nmay prove incorrect.\n13\nFollowing the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock,\nand the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of\nshares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company’s common stock\nmay be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.\nThe planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe Company intends to obtain an opinion from its U.S. tax advisors and a ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free\nnature of the planned separation under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The opinion and ruling\nwill be based on, among other things, various factual assumptions and representations that the Company and the New\nConsumer Health Company will make regarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and\nother matters. If any of these assumptions or representations are, or become, inaccurate or incomplete, reliance on\nthe opinion and ruling may be jeopardized. If subsequent to the planned separation it is determined that the\ntransaction does not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax\nliability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify for\ntax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability to\nthe Company.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\nworkforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important\nto our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective\ntransfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an\ninfluence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in\nloss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks,\nand those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research,\nbusiness plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\nprotection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and\ncybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these\nsystems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The\nCompany continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and\nresponse capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and\ncontrols, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or\noperations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\nCompany to be adversely\n14\nimpacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as\nfinancial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event of an information\nsecurity or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial, legal, business or\nreputational losses.\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact to\nthe Company’s business or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance\nobligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such\nrequirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our\nreputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy\nenforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international\ndata flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are\nrequired to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company\nand involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border\ndata flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact\nour business operations and research activities.",

The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into three business segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The\nConsumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty,\nOver-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general\npublic and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical\nsegment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed\ndirectly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The\nMedical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional\nSolutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers,\nhospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care\nprofessionals and clinics.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices business segments.\nIn all of its product lines, the Company competes with other companies both locally and globally, throughout the\nworld. Competition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies\ninvolved. Competition in research, involving the development and the improvement of new and existing products and\nprocesses, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative products, as well as protecting the\nunderlying intellectual property of the Company's product portfolio, is important to the Company’s success in all\nareas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research. In\naddition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the Company’s consumer products involves\nsignificant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nManagement’s Objectives\nWith “Our Credo” as the foundation, the Company’s purpose is to blend heart, science and ingenuity to profoundly\nchange the trajectory of health for humanity. The Company is committed to bringing its full breadth and depth to\nensure health for people today and for future generations. United around this common ambition, the Company is\npoised to fulfill its purpose and successfully meet the demands of the rapidly evolving markets in which it\ncompetes.\nThe Company is broadly based in human healthcare, and is committed to creating value by developing accessible, high\nquality, innovative products and services. New products introduced within the past five years accounted for\napproximately 25% of 2021 sales. In 2021, $14.7 billion was invested in research and development reflecting\nmanagement’s commitment to create life-enhancing innovations and to create value through partnerships that will\nprofoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\nA critical driver of the Company’s success is the diversity of its 141,700 employees worldwide. Employees are\nempowered and inspired to lead with the Company’s Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to\nuse the Company’s reach and size to advance the Company's purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency.\nLeveraging the extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with\nexcellence. This ensures the Company can remain focused on addressing the unmet needs of society every day and\ninvest for an enduring impact, ultimately delivering value to its patients, consumers and healthcare professionals,\nemployees, communities and shareholders.\n21\nResults of Operations\nAnalysis of Consolidated Sales\nFor discussion on results of operations and financial condition pertaining to the fiscal years 2020 and 2019 see\nthe Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021, Item 7. Management's Discussion\nand Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition.\nIn 2021, worldwide sales increased 13.6% to $93.8 billion as compared to an increase of 0.6% in 2020. These sales\nchanges consisted of the following:\nSales increase/(decrease) due to:    2021       2020\nVolume                               12.9  %     3.5  %\nPrice                                -0.7       -2.3\nCurrency                              1.4       -0.6\nTotal                                13.6  %     0.6  %\nThe net impact of acquisitions and divestitures on the worldwide sales growth was a negative impact of 0.6% in 2021\nand a negative impact of 0.3% in 2020.\nSales by U.S. companies were $47.2 billion in 2021 and $43.1 billion in 2020. This represents increases of 9.3% in\n2021 and 2.5% in 2020. Sales by international companies were $46.6 billion in 2021 and $39.5 billion in 2020. This\nrepresents an increase of 18.2% in 2021 and a decrease of 1.3% in 2020.\nThe five-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 5.5%, 4.5% and 6.5%,\nrespectively. The ten-year compound annual growth rates for worldwide, U.S. and international sales were 3.7%, 5.0%\nand 2.6%, respectively.\nIn 2021, sales by companies in Europe achieved growth of 24.3% as compared to the prior year, which included\noperational growth of 20.7% and a positive currency impact of 3.6%. Sales by companies in the Western Hemisphere\n(excluding the U.S.) achieved growth of 7.8% as compared to the prior year, which included operational growth of\n7.3% and a positive currency impact of 0.5%. Sales by companies in the Asia-Pacific, Africa region achieved growth\nof 14.1% as compared to the prior year, including operational growth of 11.4% and a positive currency impact of\n2.7%.\nThe Company estimated that the inclusion of a 53rd week in the fiscal year 2020 results negatively impacted the\n2021 comparative sales growth by approximately 1.0%. (See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nAnnual Closing Date details). While the additional week added a few days to sales, it also added a full week's\nworth of operating costs; therefore, the net earnings impact was negligible.\nIn 2021, the Company utilized three wholesalers distributing products for all three segments that represented\napproximately 14.0%, 11.0% and 11.0% of the total consolidated revenues. In 2020, the Company had three wholesalers\ndistributing products for all three segments that represented approximately 16.0%, 12.0% and 12.0% of the total\nconsolidated revenues.\nNote: values may have been rounded\n22\nAnalysis of Sales by Business Segments\nConsumer Health Segment\nConsumer Health segment sales in 2021 were $14.6 billion, an increase of 4.1% from 2020, which included 2.8%\noperational growth and a positive currency impact of 1.3%.

This was partially offset by\nlower sales of REMICADE ® (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE ® have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE ® .\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA ® (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA ®\n(ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2021 were approximately $5.9 billion. The expiration of a product patent or loss\nof market exclusivity is likely to result in a reduction in sales.\nInfectious disease products achieved sales of $5.9 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 64.0% as compared\nto the prior year. Growth was primarily driven by the contribution of the COVID-19 vaccine. This was partially\noffset by lower sales of PREZISTA ® and PREZCOBIX ® /REZOLSTA ® (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition\nand loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA ® in certain countries outside the U.S.\nNeuroscience products achieved sales of $7.0 billion, representing an increase of 7.1% as compared to the prior\nyear. Paliperidone long-acting injectables growth was driven by sales of INVEGA SUSTENNA ® /XEPLION ® (paliperidone\npalmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA ® /TREVICTA ® from new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA\nHAFYERA™.\nOncology products achieved sales of $14.5 billion in 2021, representing an increase of 17.6% as compared to the\nprior year. Contributors to the growth were strong sales of DARZALEX ® (daratumumab) driven by continued strong\nmarket growth, share gains in all regions and solid uptake of the subcutaneous formulation launched in 2020; the\ncontinued global launch uptake of ERLEADA ® (apalutamide) and IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) growth primarily driven by\nmarket and continued share leadership. The growth of IMBRUVICA ® (ibrutinib) was partially offset by competitive\npressures from novel oral agents and COVID-19 related market dynamics including delays in new patient starts.\nPulmonary Hypertension products achieved sales of $3.5 billion, representing an increase of 9.6% as compared to the\nprior year. Sales growth of OPSUMIT ® (macitentan) and UPTRAVI ® (selexipag) were due to continued share gains and\nmarket growth.\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $4.5 billion, a decline of 8.6% as compared to the prior year.\nThe decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA ® /INVOKAMET ® (canagliflozin) due to share\nerosion and PROCRIT ® / EPREX ® (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition.\n25\nDuring 2021, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and\nadditional indications for existing drugs as follows:\nProduct Name                Indication                   US  Approval    EU  Approval    US Filing    EU Filing\n(Chemical Name)\nBYANNLI®                    Maintenance Treatment of\nSchizophrenia in Adults\nCABENUVA (rilpivirine       HIV treatment for use\nand cabotegravir)           every two months\nCOVID-19 Vaccine            COVID-19 Emergency Use\nCOVID-19 Vaccine Booster    COVID-19 Emergency Use\nShot\nSubcutaneous (SC)\nformulation Treatment for\nNewly Diagnosed Systemic\nDARZALEX®(daratumumab)      Light Chain Amyloidosis\nand Gains an Additional\nApproval in Pre-Treated\nMultiple Myeloma\nCombination with\nDARZALEX                    Carfilzomib and\nFASPRO®(daratumumab and     Dexamethasone for\nhyaluronidase-fihj)         Patients with Multiple\nMyeloma After First or\nSubsequent Relapse\nFirst and Only\nINVEGA HAFYERA              Twice-Yearly Treatment\n(paliperidone palmitate)    for Adults with\nSchizophrenia\nTreatment of Adults with\nRelapsing Forms of\nPONVORY (Ponesimod)         Multiple Sclerosis with\nActive Disease Defined by\nClinical or Imaging\nFeatures\nOral Treatment for Adults\nPONVORY (Ponesimod)         with Relapsing Multiple\nSclerosis\nTreatment for Patients\nRYBREVANT                   with Non-Small Cell Lung\n(amivantamab-vmjw)          Cancer with EGFR Exon 20\nInsertion Mutations\nRapid reduction of\ndepressive symptoms in a\nSPRAVATO®(esketamine)       psychiatric emergency for\npatients with major\ndepressive disorder\nTreatment of Pediatric\nSTELARA®(ustekinumab)       Patients with Juvenille\nPsoriatic Arthritis\nTreatment of Patients\nTeclistamab                 with Relapsed or\nRefractory Multiple\nMyeloma\nIntravenous Use in Adult\nUPTRAVI®                    Patients with Pulmonary\n(selexipag)                 Arterial Hypertension\n(PAH)\nHelp Prevent and Treat\nXARELTO®(rivaroxaban)       Blood Clots in Pediatric\nPatients\nExpanded Peripheral\nArtery Disease (PAD)\nXARELTO®(rivaroxaban)       Indication to Include\nPatients After\nLower-Extremity\nRevascularization (LER)\n26\nMedical Devices Segment\nThe Medical Devices segment sales in 2021 were $27.1 billion, an increase of 17.9% from 2020, which included\noperational growth of 16.2% and a positive currency impact of 1.7%.

This was primarily due to lower rates of interest earned on\ncash balances and a higher average debt balance, partially offset by the benefit from net investment hedging. Cash,\ncash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $31.6 billion at the end of 2021, and averaged $28.4 billion as\ncompared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $25.2 billion and $22.2 billion average\ncash balance in 2020. The total debt balance at the end of 2021 was $33.8 billion with an average debt balance of\n$34.5 billion as compared to $35.3 billion at the end of 2020 and an average debt balance of $31.5 billion.\nIncome Before Tax by Segment\nIncome (loss) before tax by segment of business were as follows:\nPercent of Segment\n(Dollars in             Income Before Tax              Segment Sales                           Sales\nMillions)                            2021      2020             2021      2020                  2021       2020\nConsumer Health      $              1,294    -1,064           14,635    14,053                   8.8  %    -7.6\nPharmaceutical                     18,181    15,462           52,080    45,572                  34.9       33.9\nMedical Devices                     4,373     3,044           27,060    22,959                  16.2       13.3\nTotal(1)                           23,848    17,442           93,775    82,584                  25.4       21.1\nLess: Net expense\nnot allocated to                    1,072       945\nsegments(2)\nEarnings before\nprovision for        $             22,776    16,497           93,775    82,584                  24.3  %    20.0\ntaxes on\nincome\n(1) See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense.\nConsumer Health Segment:\nIn 2021, the Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales was 8.8% versus a loss before tax of\n7.6% in 2020.

The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of\nstrategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness,\nenhancing capabilities and optimizing its network. Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and\nare subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects\nthese actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be\nsubstantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of\napproximately $2.1 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs\nwill result in cash outlays. In 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on\nthe following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other\n(income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have\nbeen recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 8.3% in 2021 and 10.8% in 2020.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2021 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity & Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.5 billion at the end of 2021 as compared to $14.0 billion at the end of 2020.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.5 billion increase were:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$                   14.0    Q4 2020 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n23.4    cash generated from operating activities\n-8.7    net cash used by investing activities\n-14.0    net cash used by financing activities\n-0.2    effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$                   14.5    Q4 2021 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $17.1 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2021 and $11.2\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2020.

As of January 2, 2022, the net debt position was $2.1 billion as compared to the prior year\nof $10.1 billion. There was a decrease in the net debt position due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash,\ncash equivalents, and marketable securities generating from operations. The debt balance at the end of 2021 was\n$33.8 billion as compared to $35.3 billion in 2020. Considering recent market conditions and the on-going COVID-19\ncrisis, the Company has evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any\nsignificant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from\nexternal sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper\nmarkets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's approximate\n$1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated with its development of the COVID-19 vaccine, the opioid\nlitigation settlement for $5.0 billion and the establishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities\n(See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors\nthe global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are\nfavorable. Effective beginning in fiscal 2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 currently requires the Company\nto deduct U.S. and international research and development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead\nof in the current fiscal year. As a result, the Company is expecting an increase in annual cash tax payments to the\nU.S Treasury of an incremental $1.0 to 1.5 billion beginning in fiscal 2022. The Company will concurrently record a\ndeferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes and\ntherefore, the Company is not expecting a significant impact to its effective tax rate related to this change. The\nrequirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is\nnot affected by this provision. Additionally, as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), the Company has\naccess to its cash outside the U.S. at a significantly reduced cost. During the fiscal third quarter of\n32\n2021, in accordance with the terms of the agreement associated with the acquisition of Actelion, the Company's\nundrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nJanuary 2, 2022: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\nTax Legislation                             Interest on\n(Dollars in Millions)                (TCJA)    Debt Obligations    Debt Obligations     Total\n2022                     $              812               2,131                 909     3,852\n2023                                  1,522               1,551                 893     3,966\n2024                                  2,029               1,518                 843     4,390\n2025                                  2,536               1,732                 789     5,057\n2026                                      —               1,995                 744     2,739\nAfter 2026                                —              23,189               8,786    31,975\nTotal                    $            6,899              32,116              12,964    51,979\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The table does not include activity related\nto business combinations or the Company’s approximate $1.1 billion in contractual supply commitments associated\nwith its development of a COVID-19 vaccine.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2, 2022 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 2,\n2022 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either\nscenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $2.2 billion. In either scenario, at\nmaturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by approximately $0.1 billion.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2021, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility. Total credit available to the Company approximates $10 billion, which\nexpires on September 8, 2022. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either\nSecured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable\nmargins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2021 and 2020 were $33.8 billion and $35.3 billion, respectively. The decrease in\nborrowings was due to the repayment of debt. In 2021, net debt (cash and current marketable securities, net of\ndebt) was $2.1 billion compared to net debt of $10.1 billion in 2020. Total debt represented 31.3% of total capital\n(shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2021 and 35.8% of total capital in 2020. Shareholders’ equity per share at\nthe end of 2021 was $28.16 compared to $24.04 at year-end 2020.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n33\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2021 for the 59th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.19 per share\nin 2021 and $3.98 per share in 2020.\nOn January 4, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.06 per share, payable on March 8,\n2022 to shareholders of record as of February 22, 2022.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving\nfactors including, but not limited to, the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact\nworldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the\nspeed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed\ncertain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with\nthe information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2,\n2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the\nCompany’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and\nassociated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a\nmaterial impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022,\nthe Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result\nin material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback\nprovisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily\nthrough the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as\ninternally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the Medical Devices segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the\nfiscal years 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements of certain products, which are included in\n34\nsales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share payments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and\nare included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and January 3,\n2021.\nConsumer Health Segment\n(Dollars in Millions)                        Balance at                                           Balance at\n2021                                Beginning of

Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $0.7 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. Prior to fiscal 2020, for performance share units, the fair market\nvalue was calculated for each of the three component goals at the date of grant: operational sales, adjusted\noperational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. Beginning in fiscal 2020, for performance\nshare units, the fair market value is calculated for the two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted\noperational earnings per share and relative total shareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share\ngoal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at\nthe time of the award, discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the performance share units during the\nvesting period. The fair value for the relative total shareholder return goal of each performance share unit was\nestimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo valuation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 2, 2022.\n37\nEconomic and Market Factors\nCOVID-19 considerations and business continuity\nThe Company has considered various internal and external factors in assessing the potential impact of COVID-19 on\nits business and financial results based upon information available at this time, as follows:\nOperating Model: The Company has a diversified business model across the healthcare industry with flexibility\ndesigned into its manufacturing, research and development clinical operations and commercial capabilities.\nSupply Chain: The Company continues to leverage its global manufacturing footprint and dual-source capabilities\nwhile closely monitoring and maintaining critical inventory at major distribution centers away from high-risk areas\nto help ensure adequate and effective distribution.\nBusiness Continuity: The robust, active business continuity plans across the Company's network have been\ninstrumental in preparing the Company for events like COVID-19 and the ability to meet the majority of patient and\nconsumer needs remains uninterrupted.\nWorkforce: The Company has put procedures in place to protect its essential workforce in manufacturing,\ndistribution, commercial and research operations while ensuring appropriate remote working protocols have been\nestablished for other employees.\nLiquidity: The Company's high-quality credit rating allows the Company superior access to the financial capital\nmarkets for the foreseeable future.\nDomestic and Foreign Legislation: The Company will continue to assess and evaluate the on-going global\nlegislative efforts to combat the COVID-19 impact on economies and the sectors in which it participates. Currently,\nthe recent legislative acts put in place are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s operations.\nIn fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine\nproduction with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provide the Company with\nfuture supplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such\nproduction if capacity is not required. Amounts paid for services to be delivered and contractually obligated to be\npaid to these contract manufacturing organizations of approximately $1.1 billion are reflected in the prepaid\nexpenses and other, other assets, accrued liabilities and other liabilities accounts in the Company's consolidated\nbalance sheet upon execution of each agreement. Additionally, the Company has entered into certain vaccine\ndevelopment cost sharing arrangements with government related organizations.\nThe Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply arrangements, including its\ncontract with Emergent BioSolutions and related production activities at its Bayview, Maryland facility. The\nCompany has established a global vaccine supply network, where, in addition to its internal manufacturing site in\nLeiden, the Netherlands, ten other manufacturing sites will be involved in the production of vaccine across\ndifferent countries and continents. The Company does not believe that a disruption at a vaccine manufacturing site,\nor the resulting delay would have a material financial impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements or\nresults.\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2011 - 2021, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate\nsurpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of\nincreasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity\nimprovements and periodic price increases.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2021 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.2\nbillion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealthcare products.\n38\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\nregarding legal proceedings.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 10, 2022,\nthere were 127,899 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.",

include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately 141,700employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries\nof the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into threebusiness segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices. The\nConsumer Health segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty,\nOver-the-Counter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general\npublic and sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical\nsegment is focused on six therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed\ndirectly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The\nMedical Devices segment includes a broad range of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional\nSolutions (cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers,\nhospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care\nprofessionals and clinics.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the\nintention to create a new, publicly traded company. The Company is targeting completion of the planned separation\nin 18 to 24 months after initial announcement.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2021.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 2, 2022\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any,\nfrom the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021. There were no new material\naccounting standards issued in fiscal 2021 that impacted the Company.\nASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform\nIn mid- 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates\nfor the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) after 2021 hence market participants should work to transition to\nalternative reference rates (Reference Rate Reform) and should not rely on LIBOR being available after the end of\n2021. Reference rate reform is the term used to refer to the efforts that have been undertaken by regulators and\nother market participants to introduce new reference rates that are based on a larger and more liquid population of\nobservable transactions. The Company evaluated the implications of reference rate reform and applicable financial\nreporting guidance in ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate\nReform on Financial Reporting on its key financial and commercial contracts that referenced LIBOR including any\nhedging relationships. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to\napply a new reference rate (primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate “SOFR” where applicable). The company\nalso applied available practical expedients under ASC 848 to in scope financial and commercial contracts that\npreviously referenced LIBOR when applicable. As a result, the Company's implementation of any reference rate reform\nprovisions to commercial and financial contracts did not result in any material change for the Company.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have\n47\nat least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash primarily in government securities and\nobligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse repurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAvailable-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are\nclassified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity\nsecurities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company\nreviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nBuilding and building equipment    20-30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are\nnot available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for\nas variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates,\nReturns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the\nCompany's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nwhich amounted to $ 7.7billion and $ 7.2billion as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler\nand other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the\n48\nMedical Devices segment are typically resalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products\nfrom inventory for returned products. The sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0%\nof annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. For all years presented, profit-share\npayments were less than 3.0% of the total revenues and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.1billion, $ 1.0billion and $ 1.0billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020\nand 2019, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 0.5% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2021 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\nPurchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the\nunderlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived\nintangible asset, or abandoned, at which point the intangible asset will be written off or partially impaired.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\nFinancial Instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-\nbased measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach\n49\non leases of assets under master service agreements, exclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not\nseparating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 0.9billion and $ 1.0billion in 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively. The lease liability was $ 1.0billion and $ 1.1billion in 2021and 2020, respectively. The operating\nlease costs were $ 0.3billion, $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for\namounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3billion, $ 0.3billion and $ 0.3billion in 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when\nthose costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners\nrelated to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense\nbecause the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general,\nthe income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n*    Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful\nlife.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO ® , co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA ® , developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX ® ,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, were $ 2.7billion, $ 2.1billion and $ 2.2billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\n50\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings\nin the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate\nof 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will\ncontinue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2021 was approximately $ 6.9billion, of which $\n6.1billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet.\nThe balance of this account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next\n12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $ 0.7billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business and financial results will depend on numerous evolving\nfactors including, but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, the extent to which it will impact\nworldwide macroeconomic conditions including interest rates, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the\nspeed of the anticipated recovery, and governmental and business reactions to the pandemic. The Company assessed\ncertain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with\nthe information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of January 2,\n2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the\nCompany’s allowance for doubtful accounts and credit losses, inventory and related reserves, accrued rebates and\nassociated reserves, and the carrying value of the goodwill and other long-lived assets along with the Company’s\non-going vaccine development and distribution efforts. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, the Company’s future\nassessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors, could result in material impacts to\nthe Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\n51\nAnnual Closing Date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n52\n2.

The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of January 2, 2022, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted\nto $ 570million net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors\ncounter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company\nprimarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.\nRefer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 45.8billion, $ 37.4billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively. As of January 3, 2021, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts and cross currency interest rate\nswaps of $ 37.8billion and $ 30.6billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedge are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the\nspot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in\noffsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge\naccounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a\nnet investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as\ntheir functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of January 2, 2022, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 336million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings\nmay differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange\nrates at maturity of the derivative.\n56\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, net of tax:\nJanua…                                             Janua…\n2,                                                 3,\n2022                                               2021\n(Dol…                   Cost              Inter…      Other              Cost of              Intere…     Other\nin           Sales        of       R&D    (Inco…    (Incom…     Sales    Produc…       R&D    (Incom…    (Inco…\nMill…                 Produ…    Expen…    Expen…    Expense                 Sold    Expen…    Expense    Expen…\nSold\nThe\neffe…\nof\nfair\nvalu…\nnet\ninve…\nand\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nfair\nvalue\nhedg…\nrela…\nInte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nHedg…    $       —         —         —      -109          —         —          —         —          —         —\nitems\nDeri…\ndesi…\nas               —         —         —       109          —         —          —         —          —         —\nhedg…\ninst…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nnet\ninve…\nhedg…\nrela…\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…\nreco…\nin\ninco…    $       —         —         —       174          —         —          —         —        153         —\non\nderi…\namou…\nexcl…\nfrom\neffe…\ntest…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor               —         —         —       174          —         —          —         —        153         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nGain\n(Los…\non\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nrela…\nForw…\nfore…\nexch…\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…           17       119        30         —         47        12       -329      -137          —       -16\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor             -94      -557       123         —        146        44        298       -91          —       -52\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…            —         —         —       402          —         —          —         —        370         —\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor       $       —         —         —         9          —         —          —         —        748         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nAs of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet\nrelated to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges\nLine item\nin the                                                              Cumulative\nConsolida…                                                           Amount of\nBalance                                                             Fair Value\nSheet in                                                               Hedging\nwhich the                                                           Adjustment\nhedged                                                                Included\nitem is                                                                 in the\nincluded            Carrying                                          Carrying\n(Dollars           Amount of                                         Amount of\nin                the Hedged  January 2,          January 3,        the Hedged  January 2,           January 3,\nMillions)          Liability  2022                2021               Liability  2022                 2021\nLong-term     $        9,793                $  —                 $        -142                 $  —\nDebt\n57\nGain/(Loss)\n(Dollars in Millions)             Location of Gain /(Loss)                     Recognized In\nDerivatives Not Designated as     Recognized in Income                  Income on Derivative\nHedging Instruments               on Derivative                              January 2, 2022    January 3, 2021\nForeign Exchange Contracts        Other (income) expense             $                   -70                 24\nLocation of\nGain or (Loss)\nReclassified\nfrom               Gain/(Loss)\nAccumulated        Reclassified\nGain/(Loss)                       Other              From\nRecognized In                       Comprehensive      Accumulated OCI\n(Dollars in          Accumulated OCI                       Income Into        Into Income        January 3,\nMillions)            January 2, 2022    January 3, 2021    Income             January 2, 2022    2021\nInterest\nDebt              $              387               -473    (income)           —                  —\nexpense\nCross Currency                                             Interest\ninterest rate     $              548                 65    (income)           —                  —\nswaps                                                      expense\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values.

There were offsetting impacts of $ 422million and $ 21million, respectively, of changes\nin fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of investments.\nThe impact in fiscal 2021 was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:          2021                                        2020\nAssets:                                              Level 1    Level 2    Level 3     Total    Total(1)\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —        540          —       540         849\nInterest rate contracts(2)                                 —        796          —       796         240\nTotal                                             $        —      1,336          —     1,336       1,089\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —        881          —       881         702\nInterest rate contracts(2)                                 —        979          —       979       1,569\nTotal                                             $        —      1,860          —     1,860       2,271\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —         24          —        24          49\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —         28          —        28          38\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:\nEquity investments(3)                                  1,884          —          —     1,884       1,481\nDebt securities(4)                                         —     19,727          —    19,727      14,042\nOther Liabilities\nContingent Consideration(5)                                $                   533       533         633\n59\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\n(Dollars in Millions)                          2021      2020\nTotal Gross Assets                        $   1,360     1,138\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -1,285    -1,107\nTotal Net Asset                                  75        31\nTotal Gross Liabilities                       1,888     2,309\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -1,855    -2,172\nTotal Net Liabilities                     $      33       137\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)                    2021      2020     2019\nBeginning Balance                     $   633     1,715      397\nChanges in estimated fair value(6)        -52    -1,089      151\nAdditions                                   —       106    1,246\nPayments                                  -48       -99      -79\nEnding Balance                        $   533       633    1,715\n(1) 2020 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n1,481million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 633million, classified as Level 3.\n(2) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(3) Classified as non-current other assets.\n(4) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(5) Includes $ 520million, $ 594million and $ 1,631million, classified as non-current other liabilities as of\nJanuary 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019, respectively.

Further information provided below.\nThe fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5% compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily\ndriven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain\nwholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of\ncertain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring\nwas approximately $ 0.6billion net benefit or 2.7% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 2.3billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these\nassets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 1.7billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international\nincome” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which\nis reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally\nother fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:\nthe Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6billion for talc at an effective tax rate of\n23.5% and $ 0.8billion for Risperdal settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements for more details).\nthe Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the\nAuris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4% (See Notes 5 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for more details).\nThe fiscal year 2020 tax rate decreased by 1.9% compared to the fiscal year 2019 tax rate. which was primarily\ndriven by the following items. In fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV\nFinancing (TRAF) which became effective on January 1, 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow\ncompanies, under certain conditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to\nbe depreciated and amortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations\nfor companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research\nand development\n63\ntax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1) tax basis step-up\nsimilar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not to exceed 5 years.\nThe Company currently has operations located in various Swiss cantons. During the fiscal year 2019, as described in\nfurther detail below, the Company recorded the impacts of the TRAF that were enacted in that period.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF\nlegislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the\nremaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its\nestimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded\nadditional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss\nTax Reform of approximately $ 0.4billion or 2.6% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 0.3billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this\nbenefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 450million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the\nCompany’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\nAlso, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2% which\nis reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition,\nin the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\nthe impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $ 4.0billion which reduced the U.S. earnings\nbefore taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%;\nthe accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0billion associated with a revised agreement\nin principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4%\nThe Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition (see Note\n18) and reversed of some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax\nexaminations in certain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\nIn fiscal year 2019, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international\nsubsidiaries in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2019, which resulted in a reduction of certain withholding and local\ntaxes that it had previously recognized as part of the provisional Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) tax charge in the\nfiscal year 2017 and finalized in the fiscal year 2018. Following the completion of this restructuring and approval\nby the applicable local authorities, the Company reversed a deferred tax liability of $ 0.6billion and a related\ndeferred tax asset of $ 0.2billion for U.S. foreign tax credits, for a net deferred tax benefit of $ 0.4billion\ndecreasing the annual effective tax rate by 2.2%. This benefit has been reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on\nthe Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation. The following items also impacted the fiscal year 2019 effective\ntax rate:\nThe impact of the agreement in principle to settle opioid litigation for $ 4billion (see Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements) which reduced the U.S. earnings before taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%\nand decreased the Company’s annual effective tax rate by approximately 2.1%.\nIn December of fiscal year 2019, the U.S. Treasury issued final foreign tax credit regulations, which resulted in\nthe Company revising the amount of foreign tax credits that were initially recorded in the fiscal year 2017 as part\nof the provisional TCJA tax charge. As a result, the Company recorded an increased deferred tax asset related to\nthese foreign tax credits of approximately $ 0.3billion or 1.7% to the annual effective tax rate. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “TCJA and related impacts” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company reassessed its uncertain tax positions related to the current IRS audit and increased its\nunrecognized tax benefit by $ 0.3billion liability which increased the annual effective tax rate by approximately\n1.5% (see section on Unrecognized Tax Benefits for additional information).

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax\naudits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its\naudit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In the fiscal year\n2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately$ 0.7billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final\nsettlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to\nprovide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax\npositions.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities, except as previously noted on amounts related to the current United States IRS audit. Interest expense\nand penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax expense. The Company recognized\nafter tax interest expense of $ 44million, $ 32million and $ 50million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nrespectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 512million and $ 468million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\n9.\nEmployee Related Obligations\n(Dollars in Millions)                 2021      2020\nPension benefits                  $  4,088     5,761\nPostretirement benefits              2,069     2,229\nPostemployment benefits              3,117     3,078\nDeferred compensation                  181       250\nTotal employee obligations           9,455    11,318\nLess current benefits payable          557       547\nEmployee related obligations —    $  8,898    10,771\nnon-current\nPrepaid employee related obligations of $ 4,436million and $ 656million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, are\nincluded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n66\n10.\nPensions and Other Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits\naccrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026. The impact of this change decreases\nthe\nProjected Benefit Obligation as of January 3, 2021 by approximately $ 1.8billion and is included in the\n“Amendments” line in the Change in Benefit Obligation.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2021 and 2020 the Company used December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, as the measurement date\nfor all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nRetirement Plans                        Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in Millions)                           2021      2020      2019                   2021    2020    2019\nService cost                     $             1,421     1,380     1,163                    309     287     274\nInterest cost                                    770       955     1,096                     81     133     185\nExpected return on plan                       -2,645    -2,461    -2,322                     -7      -7      -6\nassets\nAmortization of prior service                   -181         2         4                    -31     -31     -31\ncost\nRecognized actuarial losses                    1,257       891       579                    151     142     129\n(gains)\nCurtailments and settlements                       1        23        73                      —       —       —\nNet periodic benefit cost        $               623       790       593                    503     524     551\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses. All other components of net\nperiodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings.\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment.

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator.

The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). The translation of balance\nsheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 for foreign currency translation adjustments\nis included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 236million, $\n209million and $ 267million in fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n15.\nEarnings Per Share\n(In Millions Except Per Share Amounts)            2021       2020       2019\nBasic net earnings per share                $     7.93       5.59       5.72\nAverage shares outstanding — basic             2,632.1    2,632.8    2,645.1\nPotential shares exercisable under stock         138.0      118.3      136.3\noption plans\nLess: shares repurchased under treasury          -96.1      -80.4      -97.8\nstock method\nConvertible debt shares                              —          —        0.7\nAdjusted average shares outstanding —          2,674.0    2,670.7    2,684.3\ndiluted\nDiluted net earnings per share              $     7.81       5.51       5.63\nThe diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2021 included all shares related to stock options,\nas the exercise price of these options was less than the average market value of the Company's stock.

The diluted net earnings per share calculation for fiscal year 2019 included the dilutive effect\nof convertible debt that was offset by the related reduction in interest expense of $ 1million after-tax.\n16. Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\nAt January 2, 2022, the Company had 2stock-based compensation plans. The shares outstanding are for contracts under\nthe Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2005 Long-Term Incentive\nPlan expired April 26, 2012. All options and restricted shares granted subsequent to that date were under the 2012\nLong-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 650million shares of\ncommon stock, plus any shares canceled, expired, forfeited, or not issued from the 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan\nsubsequent to April 26, 2012. Shares available for future grants under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were\n240million at the end of fiscal year 2021.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,135million, $ 1,005million and $\n977million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 218million, $ 210million and $ 227million for fiscal\nyears 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n223million, $ 248million and $ 209million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for which options\nwere exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 862million, $\n804million and $ 823million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019,\n74\nrespectively. The weighted average period for this cost to be recognized was 1.78years, 1.76years and 1.71years for\nfiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory\nwere insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\nStock Options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New\nYork Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2021, 2020 and 2019 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n2021          2020          2019\nRisk-free rate               0.83    %     1.47    %     2.56    %\nExpected volatility         18.59    %    15.33    %    16.27    %\nExpected life (in years)           7.0           7.0           7.0\nExpected dividend yield      2.50    %     2.60    %     2.80    %\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nWeighted                       Value\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding Shares       Average Exercise Price       (Dollars in Millions)\nShares at December 30, 2018               109,652    $                   98.29    $                  3,214\nOptions granted                            19,745                       131.94\nOptions exercised                         -14,785                        82.43\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -2,975                       125.11\nShares at December 29, 2019               111,637                       105.63                       4,478\nOptions granted                            20,723                       151.41\nOptions exercised                         -16,275                        86.05\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -1,835                       137.62\nShares at January 3, 2021                 114,250                       116.22                       4,703\nOptions granted                            18,525                       164.62\nOptions exercised                         -13,248                        97.48\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -2,166                       149.75\nShares at January 2, 2022                 117,361    $                  125.36    $                  5,364\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 919million, $ 1,021million and $ 807million in fiscal years\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n75\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 2, 2022:\n(Shares in     Outstanding                                                 Exercisable\nThousands)\nWeighted                               Weighted\nExercise           Options    Average              Average                     Options    Average\nPrice Range                   Life(1)              Exercise                               Exercise\nPrice                                  Price\n$65.08-$90…         16,007                  1.6                  $81.92         16,007                   $81.92\n$100.06-$1…         22,647                  3.6                 $101.07         22,647                  $101.07\n$115.67-$1…         24,543                  5.6                 $122.59         23,972                  $122.43\n$131.94-$1…         36,304                  7.6                 $142.23            100                  $140.72\n$151.42-$1…         17,860                  9.1                 $164.62             16                  $164.62\n117,361                  5.8                 $125.36         62,742                  $104.42\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 were 114,250and an average life of 6.0years and\n111,637and an average life of 6.0years, respectively.

The number of shares actually earned at the end of the three-yearperiod will vary, based only\non actual performance, from 0% to 200% of the target number of performance share units granted .\nA summary of the restricted share units and performance share units activity under the Plans as of January 2, 2022\nis presented below:\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding Restricted Share Units    Outstanding Performance Share Units\nShares at January 3, 2021                                  14,998                                  2,236\nGranted                                                     4,981                                    741\nIssued                                                     -5,101                                   -610\nCanceled/forfeited/adjusted                                  -756                                    -55\nShares at January 2, 2022                                  14,122                                  2,312\nThe average fair value of the restricted share units granted was $ 152.62, $ 139.58and $ 121.31in fiscal years\n2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, using the fair market value at the date of grant. The fair value of restricted\nshare units was discounted for dividends, which are not paid on the restricted share units during the vesting\nperiod. The fair value of restricted share units issued was $ 611million, $ 650million and $ 586million in 2021,\n2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe weighted average fair value of the performance share units granted was $ 179.35, $ 160.54and $ 124.67in fiscal\nyears 2021, 2020 and 2019, calculated using the weighted average fair market value for each of the component goals\nat the date of grant.\nThe fair values for the sales and earnings per share goals of each performance share unit were estimated on the\ndate of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award discounted for dividends, which\nare not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total\nshareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. The fair value of performance share units issued was $ 83million, $ 91million and $ 119million in\nfiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n76\n17.\nSegments of Business* and Geographic

These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations\nhave been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 7.5billion and\nhas been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which\nhas multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases\nand the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science\ncapabilities.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational\ncompound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech\nInc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-\namortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.8billion applying a probability of success factor that\nranged from 20% to 60% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different\nindications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional\npayments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted for as a\nbusiness combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year\n2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate\nthe development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment\ncharge of approximately $ 0.6billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab\n(JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment\ncharge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first\nquarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year\n2020.\nAdditionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares\nin Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares\npreviously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Medical\nDevices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets,\nprimarily IPR&D, for $ 0.4billion, goodwill for $ 0.2billion, other assets of $ 0.2billion and liabilities assumed\nof $ 0.3billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $\n0.4billion.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $\n6.1billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable\nintangible assets (IPR&D) of $ 6.0billion, goodwill of $ 1.2billion, other assets of $ 0.5billion and liabilities\nof $ 1.6billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal\ndisorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the\nasset, probability of success factors ranging from 20% to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect\ninherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13%. The\ngoodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected\nto be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the\nPharmaceutical segment.\nDuring fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $ 5.8billion in cash and $ 1.4billion of liabilities\nassumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations\nhave been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 6.8billion and\nhas been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing,\ndevelopment and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health,\nInc. a\n84\nprivately held developer of robotic technologies, initially focused in lung cancer, with an U.S. FDA-cleared\nplatform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.\nOn January 17, 2019, the Company acquired DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and\ndistribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products for a total purchase price of\napproximately ¥ 230billion, which equates to approximately $ 2.1billion, using the exchange rate of 109.06Japanese\nYen to each U.S. Dollar on January 16, 2019. Additionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2019, the Company\nrecognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of approximately $ 0.3billion related to the\nCompany's previously held equity investment in DR. CI:LABO.\nThe Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the Consumer Health segment.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. The final fair value\nof the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable intangible assets for $ 1.5billion, goodwill for $\n1.2billion and liabilities of $ 0.4billion. The amortizable intangible assets were comprised of brand/trademarks\nand customer relationships with a weighted average life of 15.3years. The goodwill is primarily attributable to\nsynergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nOn April 1, 2019 the Company completed the acquisition of Auris Health, Inc. for approximately $ 3.4billion, net of\ncash acquired. Additional contingent payments of up to $ 2.35billion, in the aggregate, may be payable upon\nreaching certain predetermined milestones. Auris Health was a privately held developer of robotic technologies,\ninitially focused in lung cancer, with a U.S. FDA-cleared platform currently used in bronchoscopic diagnostic and\ntherapeutic procedures. The Company treated this transaction as a business combination and included it in the\nMedical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to amortizable and non-\namortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D for $ 3.0billion, goodwill for $ 2.0billion, marketable securities\nof $ 0.2billion and liabilities assumed of $ 1.8billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent payments\nmentioned above. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business\nacquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. During the fiscal second quarter of 2020, the\nCompany finalized the purchase price allocation. During fiscal 2020, the Company recorded Other income of\napproximately $ 1.1billion for the reversal of all of the contingent consideration related to the timing of certain\ndevelopmental and commercial milestones, which are not expected to be met based on the Company’s current timelines.\nDuring the fiscal third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a partial IPR&D impairment charge of $ 0.1billion\nrelated to timing and progression of the digital surgery platforms. In the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the\nCompany recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion primarily related to expected development delays in the\ngeneral surgery digital robotics platform (Ottava). A probability of success factor ranging from 18% to 66% across\nOttava sub-platforms, was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of\nthe contingent payments and IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 9.5%.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is not provided, as the impact of the\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or\nfinancial position.\nDivestitures\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the\nPharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of\napproximately $ 0.6billion.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the\ncompany at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337million ($ 357million)\nbased on a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the\nCompany had rights to approximately 38.7million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF\n445million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110million ($ 120million) of this\nloan into approximately 9.6million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022.\nDuring the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company divested its ASP business to Fortive Corporation for an aggregate value of\napproximately $ 2.8billion, consisting of $ 2.7billion of cash proceeds and $ 0.1billion of retained net\nreceivables. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other ( income) expense, net, of approximately $\n2.0billion.\n19.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business. Due to the ongoing\nimpacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain trials have been rescheduled or delayed. The Company continues to monitor\nits legal proceedings as the situation evolves and in person trials resume.\n85\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 2, 2022, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits\nin compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The\nCompany accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as\nestimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent\nprojected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and\nwith different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information\nbecomes available.\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing\nSystem; the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL ® ; XARELTO ® ; body powders containing\ntalc, primarily JOHNSON'S ® Baby Powder; INVOKANA ® ; and ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. As of\nJanuary 2, 2022, in the United States there were approximately 250plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits\nregarding injuries allegedly due to the DePuy ASR™ XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR™ Hip Resurfacing System;\n5,300with respect to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System; 10,100with respect to pelvic meshes; 8,800with respect\nto RISPERDAL ® ; 5,500with respect to XARELTO ® ; 40,400with respect to body powders containing talc; 100with\nrespect to INVOKANA ® ; and 4,700with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh. The number of\npending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are\nfiled.\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR ™ XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR ™ Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and Johnson & Johnson. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country . The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional\n86\ncosts associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established accruals for the costs\nassociated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability litigation.\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson\n(collectively, DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product\nliability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential\ncosts and the anticipated number of cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized\nas a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. Litigation\nalso has been filed in some state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Several adverse verdicts\nhave been rendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first\nquarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the\nsettlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product\nliability litigation associated with the PINNACLE ® Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson arising out of\nEthicon’s pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company\ncontinues to receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal\ncourts in the United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL.\nThe MDL Court has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional\npelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved\nthe majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands\nand class actions in Israel, Australia and Canada. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a\njudgment regarding its findings with respect to liability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in\nrelation to the design, manufacture, pre and post-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the\ndevices in Australia used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In March 2020, the Court\nissued a decision and entered damages awards to the three Lead Applicants. The Company appealed the decision to the\nintermediate appellate court, the Full Court. The appeal was heard in February 2021 and, in March 2021, the Full\nCourt entered a judgment dismissing the appeal. An application for special leave to the High Court of Australia was\nfiled in April 2021, and the High Court heard oral argument on the application in November 2021. Special leave was\nrefused. While this brings an end to the appellate process, there will now be an individual case assessment process\nfor the remaining group member claims. The parties currently are in discussions with the Court to determine the\nform and mechanism of that individual case assessment process. The next hearing is scheduled for late February\n2022. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an\nagreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are\ncurrently negotiating the wording and some of the terms thereof and once finalized, the settlement will be subject\nto court approval. The parties are due to update the court on the status of the finalization of the settlement\nnegotiations by the end of February 2022. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability\nlitigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal\ninjury arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have\nbeen organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District\nof Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., one multi-plaintiff lawsuit pending in Oklahoma\nstate court and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the\nplaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately\n4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in\nSeptember 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings\nare currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement agreement. The deadline for issuance of Individual\nAllocation amounts by the Special Master is March 2022. The costs associated with this proposed settlement are\nreflected in the Company’s accruals. Post-Settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket\ncontrol orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements. As of February 2022, there are\napproximately 90active cases subject to these orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and Johnson & Johnson alleging personal injuries arising from the\nPROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court\nentered an order consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court.\nAdditional cases have been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions\noutside the United States. Discovery is underway in the MCL proceedings.\n87\nEthicon and Johnson & Johnson also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE™\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON\nPHYSIOMESH ® Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED ® Mesh and PROCEED ® Ventral Patch, and PROLENE™ Polypropylene Hernia\nSystem products.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out\nof the use of RISPERDAL ® , and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or\nmixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have\nbeen filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts\nin the United States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has\nsuccessfully defended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict\nin October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $\n6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel\nrepresenting plaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The\ncosts associated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO ® , an oral anticoagulant, have been made against\nJanssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); Johnson & Johnson; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO ® , Bayer\nHealthcare AG, and certain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana.\nIn addition, cases have been filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated\ninto a state mass tort litigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles,\nCalifornia. Class action lawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and Johnson & Johnson\nannounced an agreement in principle to settle the XARELTO ® cases in the United States; the settlement agreement\nwas executed in May 2019, the settlement became final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January\n2020. This resolved the majority of cases pending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for\nits costs associated with the United States settlement program and XARELTO ® related product liability litigation.\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson\nConsumer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ®\nBaby Powder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States\nas well as outside of the United States, continued to increase through fiscal year 2021.\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there\nalso have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri\nCourt of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson &\nJohnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer\nof the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari,\nseeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company\npaid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances,\nincluding the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought\nagainst the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc\nverdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in\ncertain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI.\nOn November 15, 2021, the North\n88\nCarolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and\nenjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson &\nJohnson, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties.\nThe LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in\nNovember 2021, and that court subsequently extended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants have filed a\nmotion to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion\nto dismiss and on whether the PI should be extended. While the PI effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-\nrelated personal injury litigation, LTL has agreed to lift the automatic stay on a small number of appeals where\nappeal bonds have been filed.\nThe Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are\nowed by LTL through the establishment of a $ 2billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company has\nestablished a reserve for approximately $ 2billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. Subsequent to the\nfiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party, as a result of the\nbankruptcy filing. The impact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet been\nable to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc, and while certain amounts under various scenarios have\nrecently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL bankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate\nthe possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of\nthe United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware\n(Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from\nexposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys (Talc Claims). In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the\nCompany for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A.,\nthe Tort Claimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan\nProponents) filed their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related thereto. The Plan\nProponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing on the Plan\nProponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the Disclosure\nStatement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan. In March 2021, the Company voted to reject\nthe Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April 2021, the Plan Proponents announced the\nPlan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the Plan. The Company challenged certain\nimproprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify those votes. In October 2021, the\nBankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn as improperly voted. In October 2021,\nImerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, and certain of Imerys’s insurers\n(the Mediation Parties) have since agreed to engage in mediation.\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys\nadversary proceeding). The Imerys adversary proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with\nrespect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously\nfiled a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from\nundergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The\nBankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The\nBankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of\nBankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys adversary proceeding.\nIn June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent (together, Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc\nmines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the Imerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration\nof indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus adversary proceeding). The Company denies such\nindemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary complaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a\nvoluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan.\nThe Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution\nto a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against Talc Claims asserted against it.\nCyprus has not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR\nappointed in the Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In\nOctober 2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic\nstay arising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus adversary proceeding.\nIn February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the\nCoverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the\nautomatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic\nstay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a\nlimited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying\nthe stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of\nBankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action.\n89\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against Johnson & Johnson and certain named officers\nin the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that Johnson & Johnson violated the\nfederal securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc,\nprimarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that purchasers of Johnson & Johnson’s shares suffered losses as a result.\nPlaintiff is seeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion\nwas complete as of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020,\nthe Company answered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiffs’ motion for class certification was\ncompleted. In July 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion\nfor class certification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement\nthe class certification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. Discovery is ongoing.\nIn June 2019, a shareholder filed a complaint initiating a summary proceeding in New Jersey state court for a books\nand records inspection. In August 2019, Johnson & Johnson responded to the books and records complaint and filed a\ncross motion to dismiss. In September 2019, Plaintiff replied and the Court heard oral argument. In February 2022,\nthe Court granted Johnson & Johnson's cross motion to dismiss. In October 2019, December 2019, and January 2020,\nfour shareholders filed four separate derivative lawsuits against Johnson & Johnson as the nominal defendant and\nits current directors and certain officers as defendants in the United States District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey, alleging a breach of fiduciary duties related to the alleged asbestos contamination in body powders\ncontaining talc, primarily JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder, and that Johnson & Johnson has suffered damages as a result of\nthose alleged breaches. In February 2020, the four cases were consolidated into a single action under the caption\nIn re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . In July 2020, a report was delivered to the\nCompany’s Board of Directors by independent counsel retained by the Board to investigate the allegations in the\nderivative lawsuits and in a series of shareholder letters that the Board received raising similar issues and\ndemanding that suit be brought against certain Directors. Four of the shareholders who sent demands are plaintiffs\nin th e In re Johnson & Johnson Talc Stockholder Derivative Litigation . The independent counsel recommended that\nthe Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal\nof the derivative lawsuits. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s report.\nIn October 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint, and in January 2021, Johnson & Johnson moved to\ndismiss the consolidated complaint. In March 2021, Plaintiffs filed a motion for discovery. The Court temporarily\nterminated Johnson & Johnson’s motion to dismiss pending a decision on Plaintiff’s motion for discovery. In\nNovember 2021, at the Court’s request, the parties submitted supplemental briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for\ndiscovery.\nIn January 2019, two ERISA class action lawsuits were filed by participants in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan\nagainst Johnson & Johnson, its Pension and Benefits Committee, and certain named officers in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties by\noffering Johnson & Johnson stock as a Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan investment option when it was imprudent to do\nso because of failures to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. Plaintiffs are seeking damages and injunctive relief. In September 2019, Defendants filed\na motion to dismiss. In April 2020, the Court granted Defendants’ motion but granted leave to amend. In June 2020,\nPlaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in July 2020, Defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint. As of\nOctober 2020, briefing on Defendants’ motion was complete. In February 2021, the Court granted Defendants’ motion,\nand granted Plaintiffs leave to amend. In April 2021, Plaintiffs informed the Court that they did not intend to\nfile an amended complaint, and the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. In May 2021, Plaintiffs filed a notice\nof appeal with the Third Circuit. In July 2021, Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in the Third Circuit and in\nSeptember 2021, Defendants filed their response brief, and in October 2021, Plaintiffs filed their reply brief. In\nJanuary 2022, the Third Circuit heard oral argument.\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S ® Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\nthe plaintiffs allege that Johnson & Johnson violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65\nwarnings. In July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be\ngranted. In response to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company\nmoved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In\nApril 2020, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a\nFourth Amended Complaint but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended\ncomplaint.

Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain\nof the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the\npayment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated\nintangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\nMedical Devices\nIn December 2016, Dr. Ford Albritton sued Acclarent, Inc. (Acclarent) in United States District Court for the\nNorthern District of Texas alleging that Acclarent’s RELIEVA ® Spin and RELIEVEA SpinPlus ® products infringe U.S.\nPatent No. 9,011,412.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of\nthe applicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic\nstatutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic\ncompanies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their\nproducts to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the\napplicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In\naddition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can\ninvolve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the\nrelevant patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents Act,\nis also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the\napplicable patents.\nZYTIGA ®\nBeginning in January 2019, Janssen Inc. and Janssen Oncology, Inc.

Such regulation has been the basis of government\ninvestigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by,\ngovernment agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil\npenalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\nJohnson & Johnson and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous\nother pharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts\ninvolving allegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and\notherwise actionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average\nWholesale Price (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider\nreimbursement levels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid\nfor any portion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on\n95\nAWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid payments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these\ncases, both federal actions and state actions removed to federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in\na multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims\nagainst the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately dismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought\nby the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP cases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case\nbrought by Illinois was settled after trial. In New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is\npending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho Biotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), Johnson & Johnson and ALZA\nCorporation. All other cases have been resolved.\nOpioid Litigation\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along\nwith other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in approximately 3,400lawsuits related to the marketing of\nopioids, including DURAGESIC ® , NUCYNTA ® and NUCYNTA ® ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously\nowned active pharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both\nsubsidiaries were divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments.\nSimilar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the\nfollowing: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children suffering from Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and\nhealth insurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including Johnson & Johnson and\nJPI, have been filed by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana,\nMississippi, Missouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota,\nTexas, Washington and West Virginia.

There are close to 3,000federal cases coordinated in a\nfederal Multi-District Litigation (MDL) pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. In\naddition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against Johnson & Johnson and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class\naction on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by\nand on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. In\nOctober 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in federal court in Tennessee and is pending\ntransfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including\nfalse advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices,\nfalse claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties and/or injunctive and monetary relief and,\nin some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several liability among the defendants. An adverse\njudgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant\ndamages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nIn 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against Johnson &\nJohnson and JPI in the amount of $ 465million. Johnson & Johnson and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November\n2021, the Oklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment. In October 2019 Johnson & Johnson and JPI\nannounced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two counties in Ohio. In April 2021, three\nCalifornia counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California state court against Johnson & Johnson\nand JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers.

The settlement\nprovides New York and its participating subdivisions with up to $ 263million to address opioid-related issues,\nreimburses attorney fees and costs, and removes the\n96\nCompany and Janssen from a multi-defendant trial of opioid-related claims that commenced in Suffolk County in June\n2021. In exchange, the Company and JPI receive releases from the claims asserted by New York and the participating\nparties, including NYDFS.\nIn October 2021, the Company and JPI announced a settlement agreement with the State of Texas and its participating\nsubdivisions, including Dallas County, Bexar County, and Tarrant County, resolving their opioid-related claims\nagainst the Company on terms consistent with the Company’s previously announced agreement to contribute up to $\n5billion to all-in settlement of opioid-related claims by states, cities, counties, and tribal governments. The\nsettlement provides Texas and its participating subdivisions with up to $ 297million to address opioid-related\nissues and reimburse attorney fees and costs, and removes the Company and Janssen from multi-defendant bellwether\ntrials of opioid-related claims scheduled to commence in Texas state courts in early 2022. In exchange, the Company\nand JPI will receive releases from the claims asserted by Texas and the participating subdivisions.\nJohnson & Johnson, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies have also received subpoenas or requests for information\nrelated to opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New\nHampshire, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington.

In October 2020, the\nCompany agreed to contribute up to an additional $ 1billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve\nopioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $\n5billion which has been accrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement in\nprinciple is not an admission of liability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of\nthe agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims have been finalized and up to one-third of the all-in\nsettlement is expected to be paid within the next 12 months, depending upon the level of participation by the\nstates and their subdivisions. The terms provide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the\nagreement and, thereafter, a period for the subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. As of January 2022,\n45 states, five territories, and the District of Columbia had elected to participate in the settlement. The\nsubdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The Company retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until\nlate February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is insufficient participation. Based on expected\nparticipation, the Company has committed in advance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating\nstates (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and New Mexico) and with tribal governments, whose cases were scheduled\nfor trial in 2021, 2022, or 2023.\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand\nletters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent\ncounsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to\nthe Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or\nappropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations\nof the independent counsel’s report.\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against Johnson & Johnson\nas the nominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court\nof New Jersey.

In April 2020, the two federal\ncases were consolidated into a single action captioned In re Johnson & Johnson Opioid Stockholder Derivative\nLitigation . In July 2020, the shareholders filed a consolidated complaint. In September 2020, Johnson & Johnson\nmoved to dismiss the consolidated complaint, and in December 2020, the shareholders opposed Johnson & Johnson’s\nmotion. Johnson & Johnson filed its reply in February 2021. In July 2020, an additional shareholder who sent a\ndemand filed a derivative complaint in the same federal court making similar allegations against the same\ndefendants named in the consolidated action. In January 2021, pursuant to an order in the consolidated action, the\nthird case was consolidated into the consolidated action.

In July 2014, the United States notified the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case\nfiled pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the\nDistrict Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied\nthe qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case\nto the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit.

In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators’ second amended\ncomplaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for\nreconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s\nmotion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in\nDecember 2021.

The Mississippi Supreme Court granted Johnson\n& Johnson and JJCI’s request to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in\nlate 2019. Briefing and oral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court rejected the interlocutory appeal in\nApril 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. Thereafter, the State moved for a trial setting. JJCI\nobjected to any trial setting due to the LTL Bankruptcy and that any decision on whether the stay applied should be\ndeferred to the LTL Bankruptcy court. The State opposed any stay and argued that the trial court should decide\nissues concerning the stay. The motion for trial setting and JJCI’s objections were heard in November 2021 and in\nJanuary 2022, the Court granted plaintiff’s motion for trial setting and directed the parties to consult with the\nCourt administrator to secure a trial date.

Restructuring\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement a series of actions across its\nGlobal Supply Chain that are intended to focus resources and increase investments in the critical capabilities,\ntechnologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio, enhance agility and drive\ngrowth. The Global Supply Chain actions include expanding the use of strategic collaborations and bolstering\ninitiatives to reduce complexity, improve cost-competitiveness, enhance capabilities and optimize the Supply Chain\nnetwork. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 0.5billion, which is included on the\nfollowing lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $ 0.3billion in restructuring, $ 0.1billion in other\n(income) expense and $ 0.1billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $ 1.8billion have\nbeen recorded since the restructuring was announced. See the following table for additional details on the\nrestructuring program.\nIn total, the Company expects the Global Supply Chain actions to generate approximately $ 0.6billion to $\n0.8billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The program is\nset to be completed at the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of\napproximately $ 2.1billion to $ 2.3billion, over the 4to 5year period of this activity. These costs are associated\nwith network optimizations, exit costs and accelerated depreciation and amortization.\nThe following table summarizes the severance charges and the associated spending under these initiatives through\nthe fiscal year ended 2021:\n(Dollars in Millions)                     Severance    Asset Write-offs/Sales    Other(2)    Total\nReserve balance, December 29, 2019     $        164                         —          16      180\n2020 activity                                   -29                         —          -7      -36\nReserve balance, January 3, 2021                135                         —           9      144\nCurrent year activity:\nCharges                                           —                        53         420      473\nCash settlements                                -23                                  -404     -427\nSettled non cash                                  —                       -53                  -53\nReserve balance, January 2, 2022(1)    $        112                         —          25      137\n(1) Cash outlays for severance are expected to be substantially paid out over the next year in accordance with the\nCompany's plans and local laws.\n(2) Other includes project expense such as salaries for employees supporting these initiatives and consulting\nexpenses.\nThe Company continuously reevaluates its severance reserves related to restructuring and the timing of payments due\nto the planned release of associates regarding several longer-term projects. The Company believes that the existing\nseverance reserves are sufficient to cover the Global Supply Chain plans given the period over which the actions\nwill take place. The Company will continue to assess and make adjustments as necessary if additional amounts become\nprobable and estimable.\n102\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Johnson & Johnson\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the\n“Company”) as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of\ncomprehensive income, of equity and of cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2,\n2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also\nhave audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the results of its operations\nand its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 2, 2022 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or\n103\ndisclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially\nchallenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any\nway our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the\ncritical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or\ndisclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $7.7 billion as of January\n2, 2022. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate\nprograms, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience,\npatient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related\nto contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in\nthe U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing\nan independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend\nanalysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating\nthose claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and\n(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the\nCompany has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL),\nwhich became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became\nresponsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11\nof the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order\nstaying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court\nconfirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement\nand prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate\naffiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. Claimants have filed a motion to\ndismiss the LTL bankruptcy case. The court commenced a hearing on February 14, 2022 regarding the motion to dismiss\nand on whether the PI should be extended. The Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of\namounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL through the establishment of a $2 billion trust in\nfurtherance of this purpose. The Company has established a reserve for approximately $2 billion in connection with\nthe aforementioned trust. The parties have not yet been able to reach a resolution of all matters related to talc,\nand while certain amounts under various scenarios have recently been referred to in testimony as part of the LTL\nbankruptcy proceedings, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amount\naccrued.\n104\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and\nexisting talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort\nin performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this\nlitigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual\nand potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as\nwell as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with\ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\nLitigation – Opioids\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including opioids, when it is probable that a liability will be\nincurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or\nverdicts have been rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined\nto be probable and can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible\nloss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a\ncomplex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions\nincluding timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various\nfactors, including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or\nindeterminate; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or\njurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve\ncomprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are\nnumerous parties involved. The Company has been named in numerous lawsuits brought by certain state and local\ngovernments, including tribal governments, related to opioids matters. In October 2019, the Company announced a\nproposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $4 billion as settlement of the matters. In\nOctober 2020, the Company agreed to contribute up to an additional $1 billion to an all-in settlement amount that\nwould resolve opioid lawsuits filed and future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a\ntotal of $5 billion. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state and\nsubdivision claims have been finalized, depending upon the level of participation by the various parties. The terms\nprovide a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for the\nsubdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. The subdivision opt-in period expired in January 2022. The\nCompany retains the right to opt-out of the agreement until late February 2022 if, in its sole discretion, there is\ninsufficient participation.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the opioids litigation is\na critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when determining whether a reasonable estimate\nof the range of loss for the agreement to settle the opioids litigation can be made, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment\nof the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the opioid litigation, including controls over determining whether\na loss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the opioids litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known\nactual and potential litigation and ongoing settlement negotiations with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as\nwell as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with\ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 17, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n105\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of January 2, 2022. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January\n2, 2022, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022 has been audited\nby PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which\nappears herein.\n/s/  J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief Executive\nOfficer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and participated in this\nevaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by\nthis Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nReports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated\nherein by reference to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”, and the attestation\nregarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the “Report of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm” included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2022, there were\nno changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company has not\nexperienced any material impact to its internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of its\nemployees have worked remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company proactively took actions to re-evaluate\nand refine its financial reporting process through additional monitoring controls to provide reasonable assurance\nthat the financial results are reported accurately and timely. The Company continues to monitor and assess the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.",
