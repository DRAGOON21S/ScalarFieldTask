          "content": "Item 1. Business\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson &\nJohnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world.\nThe Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated\nin the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company. This Committee oversees and coordinates the activities\nof the Company's two business segments: Innovative Medicine (previously referred to as Pharmaceutical) and MedTech.\nWithin the strategic parameters provided by the Committee, senior management groups at U.S. and international\noperating companies are each responsible for their own strategic plans and the day-to-day operations of those\ncompanies. Each subsidiary within the business segments is, with limited exceptions, managed by residents of the\ncountry where located.\nSegments of business\nFollowing the completion of the separation of the Consumer Health business (Kenvue) in August 2023, the Company is\nnow organized into two business segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. Additional information required by this\nitem is incorporated herein by reference to the narrative and tabular descriptions of segments and operating\nresults under: Item 7. Management’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition of\nthis Report; and Note 17 Segments of business and geographic areas of the notes to consolidated financial\nstatements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nInnovative Medicine\nThe Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas: Immunology (e.g., rheumatoid\narthritis, psoriatic arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and psoriasis), Infectious Diseases (e.g., HIV/AIDS),\nNeuroscience (e.g., mood disorders, neurodegenerative disorders and schizophrenia), Oncology (e.g., prostate\ncancer, hematologic malignancies, lung cancer and bladder cancer), Cardiovascular and Metabolism (e.g., thrombosis,\ndiabetes and macular degeneration) and Pulmonary Hypertension (e.g., Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension). Medicines in\nthis segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare\nprofessionals for prescription use. Key products in the Innovative Medicine segment include: REMICADE (infliximab),\na treatment for a number of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases; SIMPONI (golimumab), a subcutaneous treatment\nfor adults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis, active ankylosing spondylitis\nand moderately active to severely active ulcerative colitis; SIMPONI ARIA (golimumab), an intravenous treatment for\nadults with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, active psoriatic arthritis and active ankylosing spondylitis\nand active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA) in people 2 years of age and older; STELARA\n(ustekinumab), a treatment for adults and children with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, for adults with active\npsoriatic arthritis, for adults with moderately to severely active Crohn's disease and treatment of moderately to\nseverely active ulcerative colitis; TREMFYA (guselkumab), a treatment for adults with moderate to severe plaque\npsoriasis and active psoriatic arthritis; EDURANT (rilpivirine), PREZISTA (darunavir) and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA\n(darunavir/cobicistat), antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in\ncombination with other antiretroviral products and SYMTUZA (darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir\nalafenamide), a once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment of HIV; CONCERTA (methylphenidate HCl) extended-\nrelease tablets CII, a treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION\n(paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder in adults; INVEGA\nTRINZA/TREVICTA (paliperidone palmitate), for the treatment of schizophrenia in patients after they have been\nadequately treated with INVEGA SUSTENNA for at least four months; SPRAVATO (Esketamine), a nasal spray, used along\nwith an oral antidepressant, to treat adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and depressive symptoms in\nadults with major depressive disorder (MDD) with suicidal thoughts or actions; CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene\nautoleucel), a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T-cell therapy for the treatment of patients with\nrelapsed/refractory multiple myeloma; ZYTIGA (abiraterone\n2023 Annual Report1\nacetate), a treatment for patients with prostate cancer; ERLEADA (apalutamide), a next- generation androgen\nreceptor inhibitor for the treatment of patients with prostate cancer; IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib), a treatment for\ncertain B-cell malignancies, or blood cancers and chronic graft versus host disease; DARZALEX (daratumumab), a\ntreatment for multiple myeloma; DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab and hyaluronidase-fihj), a treatment for multiple\nmyeloma and light chain (AL) Amyloidosis; XARELTO (rivaroxaban), an oral anticoagulant for the prevention of deep\nvein thrombosis (DVT), which may lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients undergoing hip or knee replacement\nsurgery, to reduce the risk of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, and\nfor the treatment and reduction of risk of recurrence of DVT and PE to reduce the risk of major cardiovascular\nevents in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), for the treatment and\nsecondary prevention of thromboembolism in pediatric patients, and for thromboprophylaxis in pediatric patients\nfollowing the Fontan procedure; OPSUMIT (macitentan) as monotherapy or in combination, indicated for the long-term\ntreatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); UPTRAVI (selexipag), the only approved oral and intravenous,\nselective IP receptor agonist targeting a prostacyclin pathway in PAH. Many of these medicines were developed in\ncollaboration with strategic partners or are licensed from other companies and maintain active lifecycle\ndevelopment programs.\nMedTech\nThe MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Interventional Solutions, Orthopaedics,\nSurgery and Vision categories. Interventional Solutions include electrophysiology products (Biosense Webster) to\ntreat heart rhythm disorders, the heart recovery portfolio (Abiomed) which includes technologies to treat severe\ncoronary artery disease requiring high-risk PCI or AMI cardiogenic shock, and Neurovascular care (Cerenovus) that\ntreats hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke. The Orthopaedics portfolio (DePuy Synthes) includes products and enabling\ntechnologies that support Hips, Knees, Trauma, and Spine, Sports & Other. The Surgery portfolios include advanced\nand general surgery technologies (Ethicon), as well as solutions that focus on breast aesthetics (Mentor), and Ear,\nNose and Throat (Acclarent) procedures. Johnson & Johnson Vision products include ACUVUE Brand contact lenses and\nTECNIS intraocular lenses for cataract surgery. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and\nretailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care\nprofessionals and clinics.\nGeographic areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 131,900 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under Segments of\nBusiness – Innovative Medicine and MedTech. However, the principal markets, products and methods of distribution in\nthe international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in international business\ninclude those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key\n2\npharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. Significant legal\nproceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other intellectual property are described in Note 19\nLegal proceedings—Intellectual property of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab) accounted for approximately 12.8% of the Company's\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2023. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the\nCompany. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related\nto STELARA. The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expired in 2023. As a result of\nsettlements and other agreements with third parties, the Company does not anticipate the launch of a biosimilar\nversion of STELARA before January 1, 2025 in the United States. The latest expiring European composition of matter\npatent (Supplementary Protection Certificate) expires in 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab\nand hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 11.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2023.\nAccordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two\npatent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families.\nThe two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029, and in Europe, compound patent protection in\nselect countries extends to 2031/2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX\nFASPRO.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier\nin the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally\nfor research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations in the United States and other\njurisdictions. The Company believes that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable\nenvironmental laws and regulations. The Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a\nmaterial effect upon its capital expenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\n2023 Annual Report3\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the pharmaceutical product and medical technology industries have long been subject to regulation by various\nfederal and state agencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and\nsafety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA)\ncontinues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new\ndrugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also\nevident in major markets outside of the U.S.\nThe new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and emerging cyber\nsecurity laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Within the U.S., an\nincreasing number of U.S. States have enacted comprehensive privacy laws and federal regulators (e.g., the U.S.\nFDA, FTC and HHS) continue to stress the intersection of health and privacy as a compliance and enforcement\npriority. In the EU, multiple directives and laws (including NIS2, EHDS, the Data Act, the Cyber Resilience Act,\nand the AI Act) are rapidly changing privacy and cybersecurity compliance requirements while introducing new\nenforcement risks. In addition, China has introduced broad personal information protection and data security\nregulations, with more anticipated, thereby increasing China’s scrutiny of company compliance and data transfer\npractices. With other jurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force\ngreater accountability on the collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry. These laws\ncan also restrict transfers of data across borders, potentially impacting how data-driven health care solutions are\ndeveloped and deployed globally in a compliant manner. Moreover, as a result of the broad scale release and\navailability of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies such as generative AI, a global trend towards more\ncomprehensive and nuanced regulation (e.g., White House’s Executive Order on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy\nDevelopment and Use of Artificial Intelligence; the EU AI Act) to ensure the ethical use, privacy, and security of\nAI is underway that includes standards for transparency, accountability, and fairness, which will require\ncompliance developments or enhancements.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has\nbeen required or directed to.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our\npharmaceutical products or medical technologies are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA\ncould ban such products, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement,\nor refund of such products, refuse to grant pending applications for marketing authorization or require\ncertificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that\nthe products present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess\ncivil or criminal penalties against us, our officers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-\nwide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may\nalso recommend prosecution to the U.S. Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its\nmagnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain\nfuture clearances or approvals, and could result in a substantial modification to our business practices and\noperations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in different countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare\ngenerally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent\nfraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships\nbetween healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various state and federal transparency laws and regulations\nrequire disclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to certain healthcare practitioners, including\nphysicians, teaching hospitals, and certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing\ninternational business practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions\nwith respect to payments to any foreign government official. Payors and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) are a\npotent force in the marketplace, and increased attention is being paid to the impact of PBM practices on healthcare\ncost and access in the U.S.\nOur business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing,\ncoverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the\nInflation Reduction Act\n4\n(IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish prices for certain high-\nspend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in 2026 for Medicare Part D\ndrugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. On August 29, 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”)\npublished the first “Selected Drug” list, which includes XARELTO and STELARA as well as IMBRUVICA, which is\ndeveloped in collaboration and co-commercialized in the U.S. with Pharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company. The\nSelected Drug list also included other medicines targeting disease states that are prevalent in the Medicare\npopulation. There remains uncertainty, however, regarding how the federal government will establish prices for the\nselected products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. In any event, we anticipate that\nthe selected products will be subjected to a government-established price for the Medicare population.\nThe IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of\ninflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs.\nSeparate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater\nportion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount\nprogram with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject\nmanufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties.\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nInflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that\nthe IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and\ntherefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business\nand the broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical\ncompanies remains ongoing and CMS has yet to publicly announce the maximum fair price for each of the selected\ndrugs.\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies,\nand other bodies at the federal and state levels, which may result in additional regulations or other mechanisms to\nincrease pricing transparency and controls.\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that\nwould affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both\npositive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various\nprovisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions\nfor our products.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection\nauthorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied\non companies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In\nthe U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant\nsettlements (including settlements concerning the downstream sharing of personal information and use and disclosure\nof personal health data) and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection\nand use of biometric data and use of tracking technologies.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nand subject to increasing regulatory requirements that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in\nthe Company's products. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\n2023 Annual Report5\nEmployees and human capital management\nAs of December 31, 2023, the number of employees was approximately:\n2023\nEmployees1                               134,400\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2    131,900\n1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nEmployees by region (in percentages)\n6\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and\ninclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed\nboth professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and employee engagement\nAt the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients,\nconsumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide must\nadhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a foundation for the\nCompany policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee\nbehaviors in every market where it operates. The Company conducts global surveys that offer its employees the\nability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify\nopportunities to improve. In 2023, 94% of global employees across 76 countries participated in Our Credo Survey\nwhich was offered in 36 languages.\nGrowth and development\nTo lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and retain top\ntalent. In 2023, the Company's voluntary turnover rate was 7%. The Company believes that its employees must be\nequipped with the right knowledge and skills and be provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their\ncareers. Accordingly, professional development programs and educational resources are available to all employees.\nThe Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each person’s unique career path while\ncreating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term strategies. In furtherance of this\nobjective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for everyone, regardless of where they\nare on their career journey. To prioritize learning, the Company recently held Johnson & Johnson's first Global\nLearning Day. Employees were encouraged to set aside a full day to explore skill-building courses across five\nareas: leadership, business skills, digital upskilling, DEI, and well-being, on J&J Learn, the Company's new\nlearning platform.\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity\nand inclusion. The Company’s evidenced-based global enterprise Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategy recognizes\nhow DEI accelerates the Company's ability to meet the changing needs of the communities the Company serves in, as\noutlined in Our Credo. The Company’s DEI Vision is: Be yourself, change the world . The Company's DEI Mission is:\nMake diversity, equity and inclusion how we work everyday . The Company's enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to the\nDEI Vision and Mission and rests on four core pillars:\nBuild a workforce of individuals with diverse backgrounds, cultures, abilities and perspectives\nFoster a culture of inclusion where every individual belongs\nTransform talent and business processes to achieve equitable opportunities for all\nDrive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world\nThe Company's DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\nemployee feedback and recognizes that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same everywhere.\n2023 Annual Report7\nCompensation and benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and\nbenefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where\npossible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being,\nincluding annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare\nbenefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. In recognition\nof the Company’s commitment to help employees balance their personal and professional responsibilities, the Company\nenhanced its caregiver, bereavement, and volunteer paid leave benefits, effective July 2023.\nHealth, wellness and safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors\nto the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs\nthroughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings\nbest-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company\nadvances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—ensure employee health protection for emerging\nhealth risks. The Company continues to address our employees needs through J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers\nthe Company’s office-based employees to find the right productivity and balance of in-person and remote work.\nAvailable information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com .

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks related to our business, industry and operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in its two operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development. The Company may also experience\noperational and financial risk in connection with acquisitions if we are unable to fully identify potential risks\nand liabilities associated with acquired businesses or products, successfully integrate operations and employees,\nand successfully identify and realize synergies with existing businesses while containing acquisition-related\nstrain on our management, operations and financial resources.\nFor the Company’s Innovative Medicine businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and\nenter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the\nCompany’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are\nespecially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and\ntechnologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\nobsolete. The Company’s business and operations will be negatively impacted if we are unable to introduce new\nproducts or technological advances that are safe, more effective, more effectively marketed or otherwise outperform\nthose of our competitors.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacturing of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 61 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other\nsevere weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such\ndelays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact\nas well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a\nthird-party manufacturer or supplier could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our\nbusiness.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture and supply certain of our raw materials, component parts and\nproducts. We depend on these third-party manufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity\nsufficient to meet our needs, to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and\nto deliver those products to us on a timely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these\nthird-party manufacturers will be able to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could\nresult in lost sales and have an adverse effect on our business.\n2023 Annual Report9\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the\nthird party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual\nproperty, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third\nparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that\nis costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third- party manufacturers suffers any damage to\nfacilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties,\nis unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the\nCompany may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the Company would need\nto seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays and increased\ncosts which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nGlobal health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such\nincident(s), a health crisis or health crises). For example, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted certain\naspects of the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced\ncustomer demand and usage of certain of our products. The spread of any health crises may cause the Company to\nmodify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as the\nCompany determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners under such\ncircumstances. While the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain\nnetwork designed to help mitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our\nbusiness from being adversely affected in the event of a health crisis. Health crises could adversely impact the\nCompany’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-party\nsuppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect the\nCompany’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\nRisks related to government regulation and legal proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare\nreforms and increasing pricing pressures.\nSales of the Company’s Innovative Medicine and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by\nthird- party payors such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations.\nAs part of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payors are putting downward pressure on prices at\nwhich products will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political\nscrutiny on pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing, potentially\nimpose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law to\npenalties. Further, increased third-party utilization of the 340B Federal Drug Discount Program from expanded\ninterpretations of the statute may have a negative impact on the Company's financial performance. Outside the U.S.,\nnumerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have pervasive government involvement in\nfunding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price controls, limit access to, or\nreimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual property protection.\n10\nWe are subject to an increasing number of costly and complex governmental regulations in the countries in which\noperations are conducted which may materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and business\noperations.\nAs described in Item 1. Business, the Company is subject to an increasing number of extensive government laws and\nregulations, investigations and legal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other\ncountries in which it operates. For example, changes to the U.S. FDA’s timing or requirements for approval or\nclearance of our products may have a negative impact on our ability to bring new products to market. New laws and\nregulations may also impose deadlines on the Company, or its third-party suppliers, manufacturers or other partners\nand providers, for which there may be insufficient time to implement changes to comply with such new regulations\nand may result in manufacturing delays or other supply chain constraints. If the Company is unable to identify ways\nto mitigate these delays or constraints, there may be an adverse effect on sales and access to our products.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes\nit has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The\nCompany could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these\nmatters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally\nliable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any\nreporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for\nthat period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a\nwholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\nwhether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. FDA (or its counterpart in other countries), private\nclaims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage. These circumstances\ncan also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s products. Product\nrecalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and inspections, the shutdown\nof manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines, significant remediation costs,\nreputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nThe rapid increase in new government laws and regulations imposes significant compliance costs to the Company and a\nfailure of the Company to timely implement changes to comply with these new laws may expose the Company to\ninvestigations, legal actions or penalties. Regulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing\nPractices (cGMP) (and comparable quality regulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs and devices\ncan lead to fines and penalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new\nproduct approvals and litigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are\nsubject to regulation, investigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act,\nthe Medicaid Rebate Program, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer\nprotection laws. Scrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys\ngeneral in the U.S., and any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and\ncriminal penalties including, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs.\nAny such debarment could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The\nmost significant current investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19\nLegal proceedings—Government proceedings under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of\nthis Report.\n2023 Annual Report11\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, such as the recent enactment by certain EU and non-EU countries, and the\nanticipated enactment by additional countries, of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s\neffective tax rate and results of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax\nprovisions in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities\nrelated to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result\nin an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors\nthese proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at\nany time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the\nlaw change is enacted.\nSee Note 8 Income taxes under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report for\nadditional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose\nmore information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\nprofits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on\ntax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\nreserves.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of\nthird parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely\naffect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products\nmay challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and\nInnovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of\nbiosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk”\nlaunch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the\nreferenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and\nother intellectual property rights are described in Note 19 Legal proceedings—Intellectual property under Notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\n12\nRisks related to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation, development and implementation of new products,\ntechnologies and indications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing\nproducts lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products\nintroduced within the past five years accounted for approximately 25% of 2023 sales. The Company cannot be certain\nwhen or whether it will be able to develop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies,\nwhether particular product candidates will be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products\nwill be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers\nor uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product\ncan be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\nmarket entry of competitive products.\nThe Company leverages the use of data science, machine learning and other forms of AI and emerging technologies\nacross varying parts of its business and operations, and the introduction and incorporation of AI may result in\nunintended consequences or other new or expanded risks and liabilities. AI technology is continuously evolving, and\nthe AI technologies we develop and adopt may become obsolete earlier than planned. Our investments in these\ntechnologies may not result in the benefits we anticipate or enable us to obtain or maintain a competitive\nadvantage. The application of machine learning and AI in our business is emerging and evolving alongside new laws\nand regulations that may entail significant costs or ultimately limit our ability to continue the use of these\ntechnologies. These technologies also carry inherent risks related to data privacy and security further described\nbelow.\nRisks related to financial and economic market conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting\nbusiness internationally.\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign currency exchange : In fiscal 2023, approximately 45% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 24% in Europe, 5% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 16% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and currency devaluation risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in\nArgentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed\n100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs,\nproductivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of\ncontinued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in\n2023 Annual Report13\ncountries experiencing high inflation rates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact\nthe Company’s operating results.\nIllegal importation of pharmaceutical products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-bribery and other regulations : The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and\nenforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws and regulations, including\nthe U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and anticompetitive behavior. Enforcement\nactivities under these laws could subject the Company to additional administrative and legal proceedings and\nactions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal sanctions, and administrative remedies, including\nexclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther financial, economic, legal, social and political risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\ninclude:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates,\nmonetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other\nlimitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures, increased antitrust\nreporting requirements and enforcement activity, and import/export licensing requirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nDue to the international nature of the Company's business, geopolitical or economic changes or events, including\nglobal tensions and war, could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAs described above, the Company has extensive operations and business activity throughout the world. Global\ntensions, conflict and/or war among any of the countries in which we conduct business or distribute our products\nmay result in foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in affected countries, and challenges\nto our global supply chain related to increased costs of materials and other inputs for our products and suppliers.\nMost recently, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, impacts to the Company's business\nresulting from the Russia-Ukraine war, rising conflict in the Middle East as well as increasing tensions between\nthe U.S. and China. In response to heightened conflict, such as the Russia-Ukraine war, governments may impose\nexport controls and broad financial and economic sanctions. Our business and operations may be further impacted by\nthe imposition of trade protection measures or other policies adopted by any country that favor domestic companies\nand technologies over foreign competitors. Additional sanctions or other measures may be imposed by the global\ncommunity, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file, prosecute and maintain patents,\ntrademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, in some countries, such as in Russia, action may be\ntaken that allows companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by patent holders from the United States\nand many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be able to prevent third parties from\npracticing the Company's inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and into Russia.\n14\nWeak financial performance, failure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating or disruptions in the financial\nmarkets could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing costs and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nOther risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\nworkforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important\nto our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective\ntransfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an\ninfluence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in\nloss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact on the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks,\nand those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research,\nbusiness plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\nprotection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain and operations. The extensive information\nsecurity and cybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability\nof these systems and networks, including customer products that are connected to or rely on such systems and\nnetworks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The Company\nassesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and response capabilities,\nas well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and controls, to address this\nrisk. Because of the frequently changing attack techniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of\nthe attacks, there is the potential for the Company to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in\nreputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action.\nAlso, increasing use of AI could increase these risks. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in the event\nof an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all financial,\nlegal, business or reputational losses.\n2023 Annual Report15\nAs a result of increased global tensions, the Company expects there will continue to be, an increased risk of\ninformation security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by adversaries of countries\nwhere the Company maintains operations. Given the potential sophistication of these attacks, the Company may not be\nable to address the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate\npreventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly,\nor at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, these\nthreats could also impact our third-party partners resulting in compromise of the Company's IT systems, networks\nand data which could negatively affect the Company.\nA breach of privacy laws or unauthorized access, loss or misuse of personal data could have a negative impact on\nthe Company’s business or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to privacy and data protection laws across the globe that impose broad compliance\nobligations on the collection, use, storage, access, transfer and protection of personal data. Breach of such\nrequirements could result in substantial fines, penalties, private right of actions, claims and damage to our\nreputation and business. New privacy laws are expected in other territories, together with greater privacy\nenforcement by governmental authorities globally, particularly on data localization requirements and international\ndata flows. The Company has established privacy compliance programs and controls that our businesses worldwide are\nrequired to comply with, but with many technology and data-driven initiatives being prioritized across the Company\nand involving multiple vendors and third parties, there are potential risks of controls imposed on cross border\ndata flows, unauthorized access, and loss of personal data through internal and external threats that could impact\nour business operations and research activities.\nThe Company may be unable to achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic and financial benefits following the\nseparation of Kenvue Inc. (Kenvue), including with respect to the Company’s remaining ownership interest.\nThe Company incurred significant expenses in connection with the Kenvue separation (the Separation). In addition,\nthe Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to result from\nthe Separation. The anticipated benefits of the Separation were based on a number of assumptions, some of which may\nprove incorrect. The Company holds a 9.5% ownership interest in Kenvue. The Company cannot predict the trading\nprice of shares of Kenvue’s common stock and the market value of the Kenvue shares are subject to market volatility\nand other factors outside of the Company’s control. The Company intends to divest its ownership interest in Kenvue,\nbut there can be no assurance regarding the ultimate timing of such divestiture. Unanticipated developments could\ndelay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect the divestiture, including but not limited to financial market\nconditions.\nThe Separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe Company received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the Separation under the\nU.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Notwithstanding the private letter ruling and opinions of tax\nadvisors, if the IRS determines that certain steps of the transaction did not qualify for tax-free treatment for\nU.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting tax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be\nsubstantial. The Separation may also not qualify for tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as\na result may trigger substantial tax liability to the Company.\n16",

Cybersecurity\nRisk management and strategy\nThe Company has documented cybersecurity policies and standards, assesses risks from cybersecurity threats, and\nmonitors information systems for potential cybersecurity issues. To protect the Company’s information systems from\ncybersecurity threats, the Company uses various security tools supporting protection, detection, and response\ncapabilities. The Company maintains a cybersecurity incident response plan to help ensure a timely, consistent\nresponse to actual or attempted cybersecurity incidents impacting the Company.\nThe Company also identifies and assesses third-party risks within the enterprise, and through the Company's use of\nthird-party service providers, across a range of areas including data security and supply chain through a\nstructured third-party risk management program.\nThe Company maintains a formal information security training program for all employees that includes training on\nmatters such as phishing and email security best practices. Employees are also required to complete mandatory\ntraining on data privacy.\nTo evaluate and enhance its cybersecurity program, the Company periodically utilizes third-party experts to\nundertake maturity assessments of the Company’s information security program.\nTo date, the Company is not aware of any cybersecurity incident that has had or is reasonably likely to have a\nmaterial impact on the Company’s business or operations; however, because of the frequently changing attack\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\nCompany to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other\nbusiness harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. Refer to the risk factor captioned An information\nsecurity incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s business or\nreputation in Part I, Item 1A.

Increased sales of STELARA (ustekinumab) were primarily driven by patient mix, market growth, and\ncontinued strength in Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth,\ncontinued strength in PsO/PsA (Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis) and patient mix. Additionally, SIMPONI/SIMPONI\nARIA growth was driven by growth outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to biosimilar\ncompetition.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA.\nThe Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a\nresult of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the\nlaunch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States.\nInfectious disease products sales were $4.4 billion in 2023, a decline of 18.9% as compared to the prior year\nprimarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue and loss of exclusivity of PREZISTA .\nNeuroscience products sales were $7.1 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 3.6% as compared to the prior\nyear. The growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by ongoing launches as well as increased physician confidence\nand patient demand. Growth was partially offset by declines in RISPERDAL/RISPERDAL CONSTA and the paliperidone\nlong-acting injectables outside the U.S. due to the XEPLION loss of exclusivity in the European Union.\nOncology products achieved sales of $17.7 billion in 2023, representing an increase of 10.5% as compared to the\nprior year. Sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions and market growth.\nGrowth of ERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth in Metastatic Castration\nResistant Prostate Cancer. Sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by the ongoing launch, share\ngains and capacity improvement. Additionally, sales from the launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and TALVEY\n(talquetamab-tgvs), included in Other Oncology, contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA\n(abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) due to global competitive pressures.\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.8 billion, representing an increase of 11.6% as compared to the prior\nyear. Sales growth was due to favorable patient mix, share gains and market growth from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and\nOPSUMIT (macitentan) partially offset by declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.7 billion, a decline of 5.5% as compared to the prior year.\nThe decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and access changes.\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B\ncovered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee\ncovered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been\nand will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it\nbelieves its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited\nby the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug\nmanufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This policy had\ndiscount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2023.\n26\nDuring 2023, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and\nadditional indications for existing drugs as follows:\nProduct Name                       Indication                          US          EU          US        EU\n(Chemical Name)                                                        Approval    Approval    Filing    Filing\nFirst-And-Only Dual Action\nAKEEGA (Niraparib and              Tablet for the Treatment of\nAbiraterone                        Patients with BRCA-Positive\nAcetate)                           Metastatic Castration-Resistant\nProstate Cancer (MAGNITUDE)\nTreatment of Patients with\nLocally Advanced or Metastatic\nBALVERSA (erdafitinib)             Urothelial Carcinoma and\nSelected Fibroblast Growth\nFactor Receptor Gene Alterations\n(THOR)\nCARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene           Treatment for Relapsed and\nautoleucel)                        Refactor multiple myeloma with\n1-3 PL (CARTITUDE-4)\nEDURANT (rilpivirine)              Treatment for pediatric patients\n(2-12 years old) with HIV\nERLEADA                            Tablet reduction\n(apalutamide)\nOPSUMIT (macitentan)               Treatment for pediatric\npulmonary arterial hypertension\nOPSYNVI (mecitentan/tadalafil      Treatment for pulmonary arterial\nSTCT)                              hypertension\nIn Combination with Chemotherapy\nfor the First-Line Treatment of\nRYBREVANT (amivantamab)            Adult Patients with Advanced\nNon-Small Cell Lung Cancer with\nActivating EGFR Exon 20\nInsertion Mutations (PAPILLON)\nRYBREVANT / lazertinib             Treatment for Non-Small Cell\nLung Cancer 2L (MARIPOSA)\nRYBREVANT / lazertinib             Treatment for Non-Small Cell\nLung Cancer 2L (MARIPOSA-2)\nTreatment of Patients with\nTECVAYLI (teclistamab)             Relapsed Refractory Multiple\nMyeloma Biweekly Dosing\nTreatment of Patients with\nTALVEY (talquetamab)               Relapsed and Refractory Multiple\nMyeloma\n2023 Annual Report27\nMedTech segment\nThe MedTech segment sales in 2023 were $30.4 billion, an increase of 10.8% from 2022, which included operational\ngrowth of 12.4% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%.

Interest\nexpense in the fiscal year 2023 was $0.8 billion as compared to interest expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal year\n2022 primarily due to higher interest rates on debt balances. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\ntotaled $22.9 billion at the end of 2023, and averaged $22.6 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities total of $22.3 billion and $26.9 billion average balance in 2022.

The decrease\nin the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:\nHigher amortization expense of $0.5 billion in 2023 related to Abiomed\nExpense of $0.4 billion for an acquired in process research and development asset from the Laminar acquisition in\n2023\nCommodity inflation in 2023\npartially offset by\nIncome from litigation settlements of $0.1 billion in 2023 versus expense of $0.6 billion in 2022\nLower integration/acquisition costs related to Abiomed of $0.2 billion in 2023 versus $0.3 billion in 2022\nLeveraging in selling and marketing expenses in 2023\nRestructuring: In the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development\n(R&D) investment within the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest\nbenefit to patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits\nare primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5\nbillion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded\nin Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, included the termination of partnered and non-\npartnered program costs and asset impairments.\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within the\nMedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network\narrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $0.3 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $40 million was\nrecorded in Restructuring and $279 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings, primarily included inventory and instrument charges related to market and product exits.\nIn 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.4 billion related to a restructuring program of its Global\nSupply Chain. The Global Supply Chain program was announced in the second quarter of 2018 and was completed in the\nfiscal fourth quarter of 2022.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\n32\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate from continuing operations was 11.5% in 2023\nand 15.4% in 2022.\nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which\ngenerally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar 2 legislation with an initial effective date\nof January 1, 2024, with other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that as\nresult of this legislation the 2024 effective tax rate will increase by approximately 1.5% or 150 basis points\ncompared to fiscal 2023. Further legislation, guidance and regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well\nas other business events, may impact this estimate.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2023 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nLiquidity & cash flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $21.9 billion at the end of 2023 as compared to $14.1 billion at the end of 2022.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $7.8 billion increase were:\n(Dollars in billions)\n$14.1    Q4 2022 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n22.8    cash generated from operating activities\n0.9    net cash from investing activities\n-15.8    net cash used by financing activities\n-0.1    effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$21.9    Q4 2023 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $1.1 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2023 and $9.4 billion\nat the end of fiscal year 2022.

As of December 31, 2023, the net debt position was $6.4 billion as compared to the prior\nyear of $17.4 billion. The debt balance at the end of 2023 was $29.3 billion as compared to $39.6 billion in 2022.\nConsidering recent market conditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile\nand does not foresee any significant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the\nability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and\naccess to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs,\nincluding the Company's remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately\n$2.1 billion and the establishment of the approximately $9 billion reserve for talc matters (See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital\nmarkets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of 198,734,444\nshares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the Kenvue Common Stock), at an initial public offering of\n$22.00 per share for net proceeds of $4.2 billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the net book\nvalue of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $2.5 billion and was recorded to additional paid-in capital.\nAs of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue\nCommon Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $1.3 billion associated with Kenvue was reflected\nin equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common\nStock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436 shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450 shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $31.4 billion of Johnson & Johnson\ncommon stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the\nCompany owns 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within\ncontinuing operations at the fair market value of $4.3 billion as of August 23, 2023 and $3.9 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nJohnson & Johnson divested net assets of $11.6 billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $4.3 billion. Additionally, at the\ndate of the exchange offer,\n34\nJohnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $1.2 billion to record the deconsolidation of Kenvue.\nThis resulted in a gain on the exchange offer of $21.0 billion that was recorded in Net earnings from discontinued\noperations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-\ntime gain includes a gain of $2.8 billion on the Kenvue Common Stock retained by Johnson & Johnson. The gain on the\nexchange offer qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program,\nauthorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company’s Common Stock. In the fiscal year 2022,\napproximately $2.5 billion was repurchased under the program. In the fiscal year 2023, $2.5 billion has been\nrepurchased and the repurchase program was completed.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nDecember 31, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\n(Dollars in Millions)    Tax Legislation (TCJA)    Debt Obligations         Interest on     Total\nDebt Obligations\n2024                                     $2,029               1,469                 843     4,341\n2025                                      2,536               1,700                 789     5,025\n2026                                          —               1,997                 744     2,741\n2027                                          —               2,320                 736     3,056\n2028                                          —               2,325                 691     3,016\nAfter 2028                                    —              17,539               8,706    26,245\nTotal                                    $4,565              27,350              12,509    44,424\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2023 Annual Report35\nFinancing and market risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December 31, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the December\n31, 2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In\neither scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.6 billion. In either scenario, at\nmaturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.8 billion.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2023, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 5, 2024. The Company early\nterminated the additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which had an expiration of November 21,\n2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing\nRate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees\nunder the agreement are not material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2023 and 2022 were $29.3 billion and $39.6 billion, respectively. The decrease in\nthe debt balance was due to the repayment of commercial paper. In 2023, net debt (cash and current marketable\nsecurities, net of debt) was $6.4 billion compared to net debt of $17.4 billion in 2022. Total debt represented\n30.0% of total capital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2023 and 34.0% of total capital in 2022.\nShareholders’ equity per share at the end of 2023 was $28.57 compared to $29.39 at year-end 2022.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2023 for the 61st consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.70 per share\nin 2023 and $4.45 per share in 2022.\nOn January 2, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share, payable on March 5,\n2024 to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2024.\n36\nOther information\nCritical accounting policies and estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback\nprovisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily\nthrough the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as\ninternally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively\nnot resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not\nmaterial. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the fiscal years 2023, 2022\nand 2021.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and\ninclude volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales\nvolumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to\ndetermine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns\nprofit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to\ncustomers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0%\nof the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and 2021 are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n2023 Annual Report37\nBelow are tables that show the progression of accrued rebates, returns, promotions, reserve for doubtful accounts\nand reserve for cash discounts by segment of business for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2023 and January 1,\n2023.\nInnovative Medicine segment\nBalance at                         Payments/              Balance at\n(Dollars in Millions)            Beginning              Accruals    Credits(2)             End of\nof Period                                                 Period\n2023\nAccrued rebates(1)                           $12,289      47,523                -45,151                14,661\nAccrued returns                                  649         332                   -347                   634\nAccrued promotions                                 1          12                     -7                     6\nSubtotal                                     $12,939      47,867                -45,505                15,301\nReserve for doubtful accounts                     44           0                    -11                    33\nReserve for cash discounts                       110       1,386                 -1,385                   111\nTotal                                        $13,093      49,253                -46,901                15,445\n2022\nAccrued rebates(1)                           $10,331      43,026                -41,068                12,289\nAccrued returns                                  520         444                   -315                   649\nAccrued promotions                                 3           5                     -7                     1\nSubtotal                                     $10,854      43,475                -41,390                12,939\nReserve for doubtful accounts                     50           0                     -6                    44\nReserve for cash discounts                        94       1,281                 -1,265                   110\nTotal                                        $10,998      44,756                -42,661                13,093\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $165 million at December 31, 2023 and $203 million at January 1, 2023,\nrecorded as a contra asset.\n(2) Includes prior period adjustments\n38\nMedTech segment\nBalance at                Payments/    Balance at\n(Dollars in Millions)            Beginning of    Accruals      Credits        End of\nPeriod                                 Period\n2023\nAccrued rebates(1)                     $1,470       6,241       -6,256         1,455\nAccrued returns                           134         555         -564           125\nAccrued promotions                         43          74          -92            25\nSubtotal                               $1,647       6,870       -6,912         1,605\nReserve for doubtful accounts             125          33          -25           133\nReserve for cash discounts                  9          96         -100             5\nTotal                                  $1,781       6,999       -7,037         1,743\n2022\nAccrued rebates(1)                     $1,446       6,131       -6,107         1,470\nAccrued returns                           134         531         -531           134\nAccrued promotions                         54         102         -113            43\nSubtotal                               $1,634       6,764       -6,751         1,647\nReserve for doubtful accounts             148           6          -29           125\nReserve for cash discounts                 10          99         -100             9\nTotal                                  $1,792       6,869       -6,880         1,781\n(1) Includes reserve for customer rebates of $740 million at December 31, 2023 and $802 million at January 1, 2023,\nrecorded as a contra asset.\nIncome Taxes: Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n2023 Annual Report39\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for\nthe two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total\nshareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on\nthe date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends,\nwhich are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total\nshareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of December 31, 2023.\n40\nEconomic and market factors\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2013 - 2023, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina, Venezuela and Turkey (beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022) as highly\ninflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material impact\nto the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit\nmargins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nIn December 2023, the Argentine government devalued the peso by approximately 50%. During 2023, the Company\nrecorded a charge of approximately $130 million related to operations in Argentina due to the application of highly\ninflationary accounting. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s Argentine subsidiaries represented less than 1.0%\nof the Company's consolidated assets, liabilities, revenues and profits from continuing operations; therefore, the\neffect of a change in the exchange rate is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's 2024\nfull-year results.\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nInflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that\nthe IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and\ntherefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme.\nRussia-Ukraine War\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was\nnot material. As of and for each of the fiscal years ending December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the business of\nthe Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1%\nof revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue separation.\nIn early March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare\npurposes.\nConflict in the Middle East\nAlthough the long-term implications of Israel's conflict are difficult to predict at this time, the financial\nimpact of the conflict in the fiscal year 2023, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not\nmaterial. As of and for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries\nrepresented 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2023 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.4 billion and net income by approximately $0.2\nbillion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and\nreimbursement of healthcare products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\n2023 Annual Report41\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which\na loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss\nbeyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments\nabout future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\nregarding legal proceedings.\nCommon stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 9, 2024,\nthere were 118,772 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.",

Summary of significant accounting policies\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the company and business segments\nThe Company has approximately 131,900employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries\nof the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nKenvue IPO/separation and discontinued operations\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of\n198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an initial public\noffering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the\nnet book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $ 2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in\ncapital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares\nof Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was\nreflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal\nsecond quarter of 2023.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of the shares of\nKenvue through an exchange offer. Following the exchange offer, the Company owns 9.5% of the shares of Kenvue which\nare accounted for as an equity investment carried at fair value within continuing operations. The historical\nresults of the Consumer Health business (which previously represented the Consumer Health business segment) are\nreflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of the\nexchange offer (see Note 21 for additional details). Unless otherwise indicated, the information in the notes to\nthe Consolidated Financial Statements refer only to Johnson & Johnson’s continuing operations.\nBusiness segments\nFollowing the completion of the exchange offer, the Company is organized into twobusiness segments: Innovative\nMedicine and MedTech. The Innovative Medicine segment is focused on the following therapeutic areas, including\nImmunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology, Pulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic\ndiseases. Products in this segment are distributed directly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and\nhealthcare professionals for prescription use. The MedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in\nthe Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions and Vision fields. These products are distributed to\nwholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses,\nhospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nNew accounting standards\nRecently adopted accounting standards\nASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) – Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program\nObligations\nThe Company adopted the standard as of the beginning of fiscal year 2023, which requires that a buyer in a supplier\nfinance program disclose additional information about the program for financial statement users.\nThe Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions. These programs\nprovide participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment\ndates (which have general payment terms of 90 days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to\nparticipate in the program.\n50\nAs of both December 31, 2023, and January 1, 2023, $ 0.7billion were valid obligations under the program. The\nobligations are presented as Accounts payableon the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRecently issued accounting standards\nNot adopted as of December 31, 2023\nASU 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThis update requires expanded annual and interim disclosures for significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss.\nThis update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and is to be applied\nretrospectively to all periods presented in the financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. As this\naccounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated\nFinancial Statements.\nASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThis update standardizes categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, requires disaggregation of income\ntaxes and additional income tax-related disclosures. This update is required to be effective for the Company for\nfiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not\nhave a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.\nAvailable-for-sale securities available for current operations are classified as current assets; otherwise, they\nare classified as long term. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and\nequity securities at the time of purchase and re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The\nCompany reviews its investments for impairment and adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as\nrequired.\nProperty, plant and equipment and depreciation\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost. The Company utilizes the straight-line method of depreciation\nover the estimated useful lives of the assets:\nBuilding and building equipment    30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the\n2023 Annual Report51\ncarrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the\ndifference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are not available, the\nCompany will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for\nas variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued rebates,\nreturns, and promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the\nCompany's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nwhich amounted to $ 11.5billion and $ 9.6billion as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler\nand other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Innovative Medicine segments are almost exclusively\nnot resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically resalable but are not\nmaterial. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products. The sales returns\nreserve for the total Company has been less than 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each of the fiscal years\n2023, 2022 and 2021.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances are recorded in the same period as related sales and\ninclude volume-based sales incentive programs. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales\nvolumes for the incentive period and are recorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to\ndetermine the appropriate amounts to be deferred or recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns\nprofit-share payments through collaborative arrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to\ncustomers. Profit-share payments were less than 2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2023 and less than 3.0%\nof the total revenues in the fiscal years 2022 and 2021 and are included in sales to customers.\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 0.9billion, $ 0.8billion and $ 0.8billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible assets and goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2023 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment\n52\ntests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted. Purchased in-process\nresearch and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the underlying project is\ncompleted, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived intangible asset. If\nwarranted the purchased in-process research and development could be written off or partially impaired depending on\nthe underlying program.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\nFinancial instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit\nprice that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-based\nmeasurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The\nauthoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair value,\nwith Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of derivatives\nare recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the derivative is\ndesignated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,\nexclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment.The ROU asset pertaining to leases from continuing operation was $ 1.0billion in both fiscal years 2023\nand 2022. The lease liability from continuing operations was $ 1.1billion in both fiscal years 2023 and 2022. The\noperating lease costs from continuing operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. Cash paid\nfor amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities from continuing operations were $ 0.2billion in fiscal\nyears 2023, 2022 and 2021.\nProduct liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when\nthose costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against\nthe Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\n2023 Annual Report53\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners\nrelated to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense\nbecause the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general,\nthe income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n* Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful life.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, were $ 0.5billion, $ 0.7billion and $ 1.2billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany\n54\nestimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in tax\nlaws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously undistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings\nin the form of cash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate\nof 8.0%. This tax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will\ncontinue through 2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2023 was approximately $ 4.5billion, of which $\n2.5billion is classified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $ 0.5billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet earnings per share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nAnnual closing date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\n2023 Annual Report55\n2.

Fair value measurements\nThe Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows,\nprimarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany products and third-party purchases of\nmaterials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related\nto fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency\ninterest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the\nCompany uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and\nliabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the\nfair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the\nrelated foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company\nunder the CSA amounted to $ 4.0billion and $ 0.8billion net respectively, related to net investment and cash flow\nhedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-\nperformance risk to be low, because the Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that\nhave at least an investment grade credit rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities\nmeasured at fair value contained in this footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross\ncurrency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $ 10.0billion,\nrespectively. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange\ncontracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps of $ 41.5billion, $ 36.2billion and $\n10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the\nspot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in\noffsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge\naccounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a\nnet investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as\ntheir functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of December 31, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income was $ 377million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward\nforeign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions\nthat are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging\ntransaction exposure is 18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount\nultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are\nultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\n2023 Annual Report59\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to

Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2.

This benefit was offset by approximately $ 0.1billion of U.S. deferred tax expense on the\nGILTI deferred tax liability resulting from the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This has been reflected\nin the “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax benefit on the GILTI deferred tax as a result of an international\nsubsidiary making an election to change the treatment of a local deferred tax asset to a refundable tax credit.\nThis has been reflected in the U.S. taxes on international income on the Company’s effective tax rate\nreconciliation.\nThe Company’s 2023 and 2022 tax rates benefited from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that\nbecame effective in fiscal 2022. The Company also had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions vs. fiscal year\n2022, primarily in the U.S. where the Company recorded an approximately $ 7.0billion charge related to talc matters\nin the United States at an effective tax rate of 21.1% (for further information see Note 19 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\nThe fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate increased 8.2% as compared to the fiscal year 2021 effective tax rate as\nthe Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2021 which resulted in an unfavorable\nimpact to the Company’s fiscal 2022 effective tax rate when compared to the prior fiscal year. These items are\ndescribed below. The Company’s 2022 tax rate also benefited from the impairment of bermekimab for AD IPR&D and\nchanges in the fair value of securities in the Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory\nrate.\n2023 Annual Report67\nIn the fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain wholly-owned international\nsubsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of certain assets to fair value\nin accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring was approximately $\n0.6billion net benefit or 3.2% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of the following\nitems:\napproximately $ 2.3billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these\nassets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as International operations on the Company’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 1.7billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as U.S. taxes on international\nincome on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 effective tax rate by approximately\n1.6% which is reflected as a Tax benefits from loss on capital assets on the effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAdditionally other fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related\nitems as follows:\nthe Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6billion for talc at an effective tax rate of\n23.5% and $ 0.8billion for Risperdal Gynecomastia settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nthe Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the\nAuris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%.\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2023 and 2022 were as follows:\n2023 Deferred Tax                          2022 Deferred Tax\n(Dollars in Millions)                              Asset    Liability                        Asset    Liability\nEmployee related                                    $586                                       685\nobligations\nStock based compensation                             686                                       632\nDepreciation of property,\nplant and                                                        -902                                      -845\nequipment\nGoodwill and intangibles                                       -1,252                                    -1,737\nR&D capitalized for tax                            3,595                                     2,611\nReserves & liabilities                             3,816                                     2,733\nIncome reported for tax                              359                                     2,026\npurposes(1)\nNet realizable operating\nloss                                                 996                                     1,319\ncarryforwards(2)\nUndistributed foreign                              1,801       -1,695                        1,517       -1,604\nearnings\nGlobal intangible                                              -2,731                                    -3,628\nlow-taxed income\nMiscellaneous                                        831                                       861          -66\ninternational\nMiscellaneous U.S.                                                 -4                          452\nTotal deferred income                            $12,670       -6,584                       12,836       -7,880\ntaxes\n(1) In fiscal 2023, the Company changed the presentation of income taxes accrued on intercompany profits on\ninventory still owned by the Company as part of “Prepaid expenses and other” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n(2) Net of valuation allowances of $ 1.1billion and $ 0.8billion in 2023 and 2022. The change in the valuation\nallowance from 2022 to 2023 was driven by approximately $ 0.1billion from acquisition related activity and the\nremainder was due to normal operations during the fiscal year.\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses. The Company believes that\nit is more likely than not that these subsidiaries will generate future taxable income sufficient to utilize these\ndeferred tax assets.

The Company\nconducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress with a\nnumber of tax authorities. With respect to the United States the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit\nfor all tax years through 2016.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audits go back\nto the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve\nmonths by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions, including in the United States. However, the Company is not\nable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in\nuncertain tax positions, if any.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax\nexpense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 99million, $ 136million and $ 42million in fiscal\nyears 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 264million and $ 637million in\nfiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n9.

Pensions and other benefit plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits accrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2023 and 2022 the Company used December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively, as the measurement date\nfor all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans for 2023,\n2022 and 2021 include the following components:\nRetirement Plans                                Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in                               2023      2022      2021                         2023    2022    2021\nMillions)\nService cost                              $893     1,319     1,412                          264     320     309\nInterest cost                            1,437       908       768                          214     104      80\nExpected return on                      -2,716    -2,756    -2,644                           -7      -8      -7\nplan assets\nAmortization of                           -184      -184      -181                           -2      -5     -31\nprior service cost\nRecognized\nactuarial losses                          -199       650     1,251                           23     122     151\n(gains)\nCurtailments and                            93         1         1                           -5       —       —\nsettlements\nNet periodic\nbenefit cost                            $(676)       -62       607                          487     533     502\n(credit)\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and Net earnings from\ndiscontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue. All other components of net periodic\nbenefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, with\nthe exception of certain amounts for curtailments and settlements, which are reported in Net earnings from\ndiscontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue (as noted above).\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is\namortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan\namendment.\n70\nThe following table represents the weighted-average actuarial assumptions:\nRetirement                                             Other\nPlans                                           Benefit\nPlans\nWorldwide\nBenefit                      2023          2022          2021                  2023          2022          2021\nPlans\nNet\nPeriodic\nBenefit\nCost\nService\ncost                   4.85     %    2.46          2.14                  5.40          2.59          2.09\ndiscount\nrate\nInterest\ncost                   5.25     %    2.80          2.34                  5.43          2.64          2.33\ndiscount\nrate\nRate of\nincrease in            3.71     %    4.02          4.01                  4.22          4.21          4.25\ncompensati…\nlevels\nExpected\nlong-term\nrate of                7.21     %    7.25          7.71\nreturn on\nplan assets\nBenefit\nObligation\nDiscount               4.58     %    5.01          2.49                  5.11          5.42          2.68\nrate\nRate of\nincrease in            3.69     %    4.00          4.01                  4.22          4.21          4.21\ncompensati…\nlevels\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-\nterm fixed income instruments.

A majority of the Company’s pension funds are open to new entrants\nand are expected to be on-going plans.

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets\nin the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\nOther assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are\nvalued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded\nare classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\n74\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2023 and\nDecember 31, 2022:\nQuo…\nPri…                                                              Inv…\nin                    Sig…                  Sig…                  Mea…\nAct…                  Oth…                  Uno…                  at\nMar…                  Obs…                  Inp…                  Net\nfor                   Inp…                                        Ass…\nIde…                                                              Val…\nAss…\n-Le…                  -Le…                  -Le…                                        To…\n1                     2                     3                                           As…\n(D…\nin           2023    2022          2023    2022          2023    2022          2023    2022         2023    20…\nMi…\nSh…\nin…           $12      26           829      13             —       —             —       —          841     39\nfu…\nGo…\nand             —       —          5,9…    5,8…             —       —             —       —         5,9…    5,…\nag…\nse…\nDe…             —       —          3,8…    3,6…             —       —             —       —         3,8…    3,…\nin…\nEq…          7,7…    8,8…             —       2             —       —             —       —         7,7…    8,…\nse…\nCo…             —       —          4,9…    4,3…            43      56          6,6…    6,0…         11,…    10…\nfu…\nOt…             —       —            49      33            92      12          3,2…    2,5…         3,4…    2,…\nas…\nIn…\nat           $7,…    8,8…          15,…    13,…           135      68          9,9…    8,6…         33,…    31…\nfa…\nva…\n(1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\nThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 86million and $\n78million at December 31, 2023 and December 31, 2022, respectively.\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 14million ( 0.0% of total plan\nassets) at December 31, 2023 and $ 21million ( 0.1% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2022.\n11.

International currency translation\nFor translation of its subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. Dollar currencies, the Company has determined that the\nlocal currencies of its international subsidiaries are the functional currencies except those in highly\ninflationary economies, which are defined as those which have had compound cumulative rates of inflation of 100% or\nmore during the past three years, or where a substantial portion of its cash flows are not in the local currency.\nFor the majority of the Company's subsidiaries the local currency is the functional currency.\nIn consolidating international subsidiaries, balance sheet currency effects are recorded as a component of\naccumulated other comprehensive income. The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal second\nquarter of 2022, the Company also accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary. The translation of\nbalance sheet accounts for highly inflationary economies are reflected in the operating results.\nA rollforward of the changes during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 for foreign currency translation adjustments\nis included in Note 13.\nNet currency transaction gains and losses included in Other (income) expense were losses of $ 366million, $\n286million and $ 216million in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n2023 Annual Report77\n15.

Common stock, stock option plans and stock compensation agreements\nAt December 31, 2023, the Company had onestock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts\nunder the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share\nunits) granted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 150million shares of common stock, of which up to 110million shares of\ncommon stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40million shares of\ncommon stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1 basis\nagainst the share reserve, provided that if more than 40million full value awards are granted, each full value\naward in excess of 40million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve. Shares available for\nfuture grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 130million at the end of fiscal year 2023.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,087million, $ 1,028million and $\n1,038million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 221million, $ 177million and $ 199million for fiscal\nyears 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n126million, $ 267million and $ 213million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, for which options\nwere exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 907million, $\n866million and $ 775million for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The weighted average period for\nthis cost to be recognized was 1.80years, 1.80years and 1.78years for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\n78\nStock options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years.\nOptions granted under the 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan were granted at the average of the high and low prices of\nthe Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2022\nLong-Term incentive Plan were granted at the closing price of the Company’s Common Stock on the New York Stock\nExchange on the date of gran t.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2023, 2022, and 2021 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\nThe average fair value of options granted was $ 27.85, $ 23.23and $ 20.86, in fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The fair value was estimated based on the weighted average assumptions of:\n2023           2022           2021\nRisk-free rate               3.74     %     1.98     %     0.83     %\nExpected volatility         17.69     %    18.00     %    18.59     %\nExpected life (in years)            7.0            7.0            7.0\nExpected dividend yield      2.90     %     2.70     %     2.50     %\nA summary of option activity under the Plan as of December 31, 2023, is presented below:\nWeighted                Aggregate\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding    Average Exercise                Intrinsic\nShares               Price                    Value\n(Dollars in Millions)\nShares at January 1, 2023          118,672             $134.95                   $4,949\nOptions granted                     16,320              162.75\nOptions exercised                  -12,386              109.48\nOptions canceled/forfeited*        -10,368              155.62\nShares at December 31, 2023        112,238             $139.88                   $2,239\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 729million, $ 1,228million and $ 919million in fiscal years\n2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n*includes 7,689shares of options cancelled as a result of the conversion of Johnson & Johnson stock options held by\nKenvue employees into Kenvue stock options\n2023 Annual Report79\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2023:\n(Shares in     Outstanding                                                  Exercisable\nThousands)\nWeighted                               Weighted\nExercise                    Options    Average                   Average                 Options        Average\nPrice Range                            Life(1)                  Exercise                               Exercise\nPrice                                  Price\n$90.44-                      20,774                  1.4          $99.21                  20,774         $99.21\n$101.87\n$115.67-                     19,368                  3.6          122.49                  19,368         122.49\n$129.51\n$131.94-                     27,391                  5.6          142.84                  26,676         142.61\n$151.41\n$162.70-                     13,928                  9.1          162.75                       6         162.75\n$162.75\n$164.62-                     30,777                  7.6          165.29                     174         165.12\n$165.89\n112,238                  5.5         $139.88                  66,998        $123.39\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 were 118,672and an average life of 5.8years and\n117,361and an average life of 5.8years, respectively.

In\nfiscal year 2022, the Company had three wholesalers distributing products for both segments that represented\napproximately 18.9%, 15.0% and 13.8% of the total consolidated revenues. In fiscal year 2021, the Company had three\nwholesalers distributing products for all threesegments that represented approximately 16.6%, 12.6%, and 12.6% of\nthe total consolidated revenues.\n(1) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income)/expense and general corporate (income)/expense.\nFiscal 2023 includes an approximately $ 7billion charge related to talc matters (See Note 19, Legal proceedings,\nfor additional details) and $ 0.4billion related to the unfavorable change in the fair value of the retained stake\nin Kenvue.\n(2) General corporate includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n(3) Innovative Medicine includes:\nOne-time COVID-19 Vaccine manufacturing exit related costs of $ 0.7billion\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.5billion\nUnfavorable changes in the fair value of securities of $ 0.4billion\nFavorable litigation related items of $ 0.1billion\nLoss on divestiture $ 0.2billion.\nAn intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $ 0.2billion related to market dynamics associated with a\nnon-strategic asset (M710) acquired as part of the acquisition of Momenta Pharmaceuticals in 2020.\nMedTech includes:\nAcquired in process research and development asset of $ 0.4billion related to the Laminar acquisition in 2023\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.3billion\nAcquisition and integration related costs of $ 0.2billion primarily related to the acquisition of Abiomed\nA Medical Device Regulation charge of $ 0.3billion\nIncome from litigation settlements of $ 0.1billion\n(4) Innovative Medicine includes:\nOne-time COVID-19 Vaccine manufacturing exit related costs of $ 1.5billion\nAn intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $ 0.8billion related to an in-process research and\ndevelopment asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD)\nand Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS) acquired with the acquisition of XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020.\nAdditional information regarding efficacy of the AD and HS indications became available which led the Company to\nthe decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for AD and HS\nLitigation expense of $ 0.1billion\nUnfavorable changes in the fair value of securities of $ 0.7billion\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.1billion\nMedTech includes:\nLitigation expense of $ 0.6billion primarily for pelvic mesh related costs\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.3billion\nAcquisition and integration related costs of $ 0.3billion primarily related to the acquisition of Abiomed\nA Medical Device Regulation charge of $ 0.3billion\n(5) Innovative Medicine includes:\nLitigation expense of $ 0.6billion, primarily related to Risperdal Gynecomastia\nDivestiture gains of $ 0.6billion\nGains of $ 0.5billion related to the change in the fair value of securities\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.1billion\nMedTech includes:\nAn in-process research and development expense of $ 0.9billion related to Ottava\nA restructuring related charge of $ 0.3billion\nA Medical Device Regulation charge of $ 0.2billion\n2023 Annual Report87\nLitigation expense of $ 0.1billion\n(6) Long-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, net for fiscal years 2023, and 2022 of $ 19,898and $\n17,982, respectively, and intangible assets and goodwill, net for fiscal years 2023 and 2022 of $ 70,733and $\n74,536, respectively.\n18. Acquisitions and divestitures\nIn the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire\nAmbrx Biopharma, Inc., or Ambrx (Nasdaq: AMAM), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary\nsynthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an\nall-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of approximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.9billion net of\nestimated cash acquired. The Company will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Ambrx’s common stock for $\n28.00per share through a merger of Ambrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The closing of the transaction is\nexpected to occur in the first half of 2024, subject to receipt of Ambrx shareholder approval, as well as clearance\nunder the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary closing conditions. The Company expects\nthat the transaction will be accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations will be included\nin the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company did not make any acquisitions that qualified as a business combination.\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, there were asset acquisitions of in-process research and development of approximately\n$ 0.5billion in cash, primarily consisting of the acquisition of Laminar Inc. for $ 0.4billion which was closed on\nNovember 30, 2023. Laminar Inc. is a privately-held medical device company focused on eliminating the left atrial\nappendage (LAA) in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib).\nDuring the fiscal year 2022, certain businesses were acquired for $ 17.7billion in cash and $ 1.1billion of\nliabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results\nof operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 17.3billion\nand has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not\nmaterial.\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of\ncardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and\nheart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens\nthe Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and\nrecovery, one of healthcare’s largest areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business\ncombination and the results of operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition.\nThe acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the\nacquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00per share in cash, amounting to $ 17.1billion, net of cash\nacquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”) entitling the holder to receive up to $\n35.00per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately $ 1.6billion in the aggregate) if\ncertain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into\naccount the CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nacquired.\nThe milestones of the CVR consist of:\na. $ 17.50per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7billion during Johnson & Johnson’s\nfiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this\nperiod and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal\nfirst quarter of 2029, $ 8.75per share;\nb. $ 7.50per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella® products in ST-elevated\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\nc. $ 10.00per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella® products\nin high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective clinical\nendpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\nDuring the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, the Company finalized the purchase price allocation. In the fiscal 2023,\nthere were purchase price allocation adjustments netting to approximately $ 0.2billion with an offsetting increase\nto goodwill. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 20.1billion (net of $\n0.3billion cash acquired), primarily to goodwill for $ 11.1billion, amortizable intangible assets for $ 6.6billion,\nIPR&D for $ 1.1billion, marketable securities of $ 0.6billion and\n88\nliabilities assumed of $ 3.0billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent consideration mentioned above\nfor $ 0.7billion and deferred taxes of $ 2.0billion. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the commercial\nacceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The contingent\nconsideration was recorded in Other Liabilities and adjusted to fair value through the fiscal year end 2023 on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella® platform\nwith an average weighted life of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved\nproducts. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the\nrisk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied\nwas 9.5%.\nIn 2023, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.2billion, which was\nprimarily recorded in Other (income)/expense. In 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of\napproximately $ 0.3billion, which was recorded in Other (income)/expense.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions that qualified as a business\ncombination.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 is not provided, as the impact of the\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.\nDivestitures\nDuring the fiscal year 2023, the Company executed divestitures resulting in approximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds\nresulting in gains or losses that were not material. At fiscal year end 2023, the Company held assets, primarily\nintangibles, on its Consolidated Balance Sheet that it expects to divest of approximately $ 0.3billion primarily\nrelated to Acclarent and Ponvory.\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the\nInnovative Medicine segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of\napproximately $ 0.6billion.\n19. Legal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability\nwill be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2023, the Company has\ndetermined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be reasonably\nestimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and\nadjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC\n450-20-25, Contingencies. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\n2023 Annual Report89\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against Johnson\n& Johnson Consumer Inc., its successor LTL Management LLC (now known as LLT Management LLC) and the Company arising\nout of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there\nalso have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri\nCourt of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson &\nJohnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer\nof the case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari,\nseeking a review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company\npaid the award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances,\nincluding the terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought\nagainst the Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc\nverdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in\ncertain circumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and threenew entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against\nLTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance\ncompanies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed, although LTL did agree to lift the stay on\na small number of appeals where appeal bonds had been filed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to the United\nStates Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case\nand, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in March 2022.\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\nBankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\nLTL filed a petition for rehearing of the Third Circuit’s decision, which was denied in March 2023. LTL\nsubsequently filed a motion in the Third Circuit to stay the mandate directing the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court to\ndismiss the LTL bankruptcy pending filing and disposition of a petition for writ of certiorari to the United States\nSupreme Court. The Third Circuit denied the motion to stay the mandate and issued the mandate.\nIn April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy\nCase). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to\nsection 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining\norder staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other\nparties (the New Protected Parties).\nAlso in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the\nCompany and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained\nin force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary\nInjunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for in those cases filed in the federal\ncourt ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was\npermitted to proceed.\nFurthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed\nby similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. On July 28,\n2023, the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the\ndecision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October\n2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. Briefing is ongoing.\n90\nFollowing the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed and cases across the country that had been stayed were\nreactivated. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a multi-district litigation (MDL)\nin the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL, case-specific discovery is\nproceeding with an expectation that a trial will occur in early 2025. Separately, discovery and pre-trial activity\nis underway in various individually filed and set cases around the country, with most activity for such cases\ncentralized in New Jersey and California.\nIn the original bankruptcy case, the Company agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New\nJersey Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $ 2billion trust in furtherance of\nthis purpose. The Company established a reserve for approximately $ 2billion in connection with the aforementioned\ntrust. During the bankruptcy proceedings LTL had been de-consolidated by the Company. In the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case,\nthe Company had agreed to contribute an additional amount which, when added to the prior $ 2billion, would be a\ntotal reserve of approximately $ 9billion payable over 25years (nominal value approximately $ 12billion discounted\nat a rate of 4.41%), to resolve all the current and future talc claims. The approximate $ 9billion reserve\nencompasses actual and contemplated settlements, of which approximately one-third is recorded as a current\nliability. The recorded amount remains the Company’s best estimate of probable loss after the dismissal.\nThe parties have not yet reached a resolution of all talc matters and the Company is unable to estimate the\npossible loss or range of loss beyond the amount accrued.\nA class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey\nstate court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the\nCompany fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc\nmined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by the Company’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor\nMinerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the\nEdley Class Action to federal court in the District of New Jersey. In October 2022, the Company filed motions to\ndismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey District Court.\nArgument on the motions was heard in November 2023. Thereafter, the Company resolved this matter.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nchapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury\nfrom exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company\nfor indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan\n(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its\nalleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust\nwould pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification\nfrom the Company.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus\nPlan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary\ncontribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims\nasserted against it and certain affiliated parties.\nThe Imerys Plan proceeded to solicitation in early 2021. However, the Imerys Plan did not receive the requisite\nnumber of votes to be confirmed after the Bankruptcy Court ruled certain votes cast in favor of the Imerys Plan\nshould be disregarded. Imerys subsequently canceled its confirmation hearing.\nImerys, the Imerys Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Imerys Future Claimants’ Representative, along with Cyprus,\nthe Cyprus Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Cyprus Future Claimants’ Representative (collectively the Mediation\nParties) have been engaged in mediation since shortly after the confirmation hearing was canceled in October 2021.\nIn September 2023, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order extending the term of the mediation among the Mediation\nParties through the end of December 2023. The Bankruptcy Court also authorized Imerys and Cyprus to proceed with\nmediation with certain of their insurers through the end of December 2023.\nIn September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar\nconstruct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain\nother protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights\nagainst the Company. In January 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed revised TDP. In February 2024, Imerys and Cyprus\nfiled certain motions related to their Disclosure Statement.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In\n2023 Annual Report91\nDecember 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for\nclass certification was completed. The case was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was\nreopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January\n2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission\nto appeal the Court’s order granting class certification. Fact discovery is proceeding.\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\nthe plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In\nJuly 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved\nto dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response\nto those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the\nthird amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court\ngranted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint\nbut indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a\nFifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in\nthe Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice\nof Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its\nresponsive brief in October 2021. After the Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit, a\nstay was imposed, and the Court held the reply deadline in abeyance. In September 2023, the stay lifted. With\nbriefing complete, the Court is expected to either schedule oral argument or issue its decision at any time.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District\nof Hinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi\nConsumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc\ncontained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive\nand monetary relief. In February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However,\nin October 2022, the LTL bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued\nthe mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to this matter. The State requested a new trial setting. Later in\nApril 2023, the trial court set a new trial date for April 2024. The Company filed summary judgment and Daubert\nmotions. The State filed a limited Daubert motion. The parties agreed to the Court's request for mediation. A\npretrial conference is set for February 2024 and trial is scheduled for April 2024. However, the Company is\nactively engaged in resolution discussions concerning this matter.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. In March 2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company’s motion to\ncompel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and denied the Company’s request for\ninterlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a\nRequest for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations.\nIn April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and\nthe State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court,\nwhich expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In December 2022, the State filed an\nappeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court\ngranted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s\ndiscovery obligations. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and\nin April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto this matter. While the State notified the New Mexico Supreme Court of the lifted stay of litigation in April\n2023, the Court has not taken any action since being notified of the lifting of the stay and it remains in effect.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia (including Mississippi and New Mexico) have commenced a joint\ninvestigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has\nnot asserted any claims against the Company. Five states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents\nand other information. The Company has produced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and\nentered into confidentiality agreements. The Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In\nMarch 2022, each of the forty-two states agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July\n2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL\nBankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. In March 2023, the mediation was\nterminated. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state\nAttorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. The unique procedural history and status\nof the New Mexico and Mississippi matters specifically have been discussed above.\n92\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc\nmatters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and\nresponded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local\ngovernments. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not\nlimited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS);\nhospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle with a negotiating committee of state\nAttorneys General to settle all remaining government opioid litigation claims nationwide. Under the final national\nsettlement agreement, which was announced in July 2021, the Company agreed to pay up to $ 5.0billion to resolve all\nopioid lawsuits and future opioid claims by states, cities, counties, local school districts and other special\ndistricts, and tribal governments, contingent on sufficient participation by eligible government entities, and with\ncredits back for entities that declined or were ineligible to participate. In July 2021, the Company announced that\nthe terms of the agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately 60% of\nthe all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal 2023. The expected payment schedule provides that approximately\n$ 0.7billion of payments are to be paid by the end of fiscal 2024. The agreement is not an admission of liability\nor wrongdoing, and it provides for the release of all opioid-related claims against the Company, JPI, and their\naffiliates (including the Company’s former subsidiaries Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc.). As of\nJanuary 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or otherwise resolved the opioid claims advanced by all government\nentity claimants except the City of Baltimore, a number of school districts and other claimants.\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, hospitals, and health insurers/payors. Counting\nthe private litigant cases, there are approximately 35remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various\nstate courts, 430remaining cases in the Ohio MDL, and 4additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these\ncases have been dismissed and are being appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in\n2024 or 2025.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class\naction on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on\nbehalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. These actions\nallege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition,\npublic nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. An\nadverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and\nsignificant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other\nsanctions.\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand\nletters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent\ncounsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to\nthe Board recommending that the Company reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or\nappropriate to secure dismissal of related derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations\nof the independent counsel’s report.\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\nCompany has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints\nmaking similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal\ncourts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022,\nthe state court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the\nsecond case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion for\nreconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and subsequently\ndenied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court’s dismissal order.\n2023 Annual Report93\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each\nrelated legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to\ndefend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the\nCompany has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other\nlosses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the\nworld, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be\nrequired in the future as additional information becomes available.\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of December 31, 2023:\nProduct or product category                                  Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S    59,140\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip        160\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                          920\nPelvic meshes                                         6,720\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh              370\nRISPERDAL                                               200\nELMIRON                                               2,150\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established\naccruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability\nlitigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States\n94\nDistrict Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL). Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on\nMultidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in\nfederal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed in state courts and in countries outside of the\nUnited States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve\nthese cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an\naccrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related\nsettlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nBelgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South\nAfrica. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to\nliability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and\npost-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress\nurinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, after exhausting its appeals, the Company\nreached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia and in March 2023 the\nFederal Court approved the settlement. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020 as a result of a\nsettlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in May 2021. The\nparties in the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to approve the\nsettlement was filed with the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability\nlitigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed\nfor Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In\nMay 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately\n3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master\nsettlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. All\ndeadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending the completion of the settlement\nagreement. Of the cases subject to the MSA, 3,390have been dismissed with prejudice. Ethicon has received releases\nfrom 3,584plaintiffs, and releases continue to be submitted as part of the settlement process. Post-settlement\ncases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and\ndiscovery requirements. In May 2023, Ethicon entered an additional settlement to resolve the claims of\n292Physiomesh claimants. That settlement is proceeding, and releases are being returned. As of December 31, 2023,\nthere were 5Physiomesh cases in the MDL and 3in the New Jersey MCL which are not included in either settlement and\nwhich remain subject to the docket control orders.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed\npending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject\nto docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.\n2023 Annual Report95\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon\nPhysiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nInnovative Medicine\nRISPERDAL\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the\nuse of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive\ninformation with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully\ndefended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October\n2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in\nJanuary 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing\nplaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs\nassociated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\nELMIRON\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. All cases in the multi-district\nlitigation are in active discussions regarding resolution, and as a result, all activity is stayed. In addition,\ncases have been filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county\nlitigation in Bergen County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and\ngranted mass tort designation. No activity has taken place in the New Jersey state court litigation; however, three\nbellwether trials have been set in Philadelphia for March, April and May 2024. In addition, three class action\nlawsuits have been filed in Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has\nestablished accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.\nIntellectual property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain\nof the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the\npayment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non- cash impairment charge for any associated\nintangible asset.\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication\n“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of\nthese lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic\nversion of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court\nrulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce\ngeneric versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and\nrevenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\nintangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions\n96\nand such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior\nto the expiration of the relevant patents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents. The following entities are named defendants: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.; Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories,\nLtd.; Lupin Limited; Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A.,\nInc.; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Mylan Inc.; Mankind Pharma Limited; Apotex Inc.;\nApotex Corp.; Auson Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Macleods Pharma USA, Inc.; Indoco Remedies\nLimited; FPP Holding Company LLC; Umedica Laboratories Pvt.

The following U.S. patents are included in one\nor more cases: 9,539,218 and 10,828,310.\nU.S. Patent No. 10,828,310 was also under consideration by the USPTO in an IPR proceeding. In July 2023, the USPTO\nissued a final written decision finding the claims of the patent invalid. In September 2023, Bayer Pharma AG filed\nan appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\nOPSUMIT\nBeginning in January 2023 Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. filed patent\ninfringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking\napproval to market generic versions of OPSUMIT before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed Patents. The\nfollowing entities are named defendants: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited; Sun Pharmaceutical Industries,\nInc.; MSN Laboratories Private Limited; MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc.; and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. The following U.S.\npatents are included in one or more cases: 7,094,781; and 10,946,015. In November 2023, the Company entered into a\nconfidential settlement agreement with MSN Laboratories Private Limited and MSN Pharmaceuticals Inc. In December\n2023, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited and\nSun Pharmaceuticals Industries, Inc.\nINVEGA SUSTENNA\nBeginning in January 2018, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed patent infringement\nlawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking approval to\nmarket generic versions of INVEGA SUSTENNA before expiration of the Orange Book Listed Patent. The following\nentities are named defendants: Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Laboratories Limited; Pharmascience Inc.;\nMallinckrodt PLC; Specgx LLC; Tolmar, Inc.; and Accord Healthcare, Inc.

Kenvue separation and discontinued operations\nOn May 8, 2023, Kenvue, completed an initial public offering (the IPO) resulting in the issuance of\n198,734,444shares of its common stock, par value $ 0.01per share (the “Kenvue Common Stock”), at an initial public\noffering of $ 22.00per share for net proceeds of $ 4.2billion. The excess of the net proceeds from the IPO over the\nnet book value of the Johnson & Johnson divested interest was $ 2.5billion and was recorded to additional paid-in\ncapital. As of the closing of the IPO, Johnson & Johnson owned approximately 89.6% of the total outstanding shares\nof Kenvue Common Stock and at July 2, 2023, the non-controlling interest of $ 1.3billion associated with Kenvue was\nreflected in equity attributable to non-controlling interests in the consolidated balance sheet in the fiscal\nsecond quarter of 2023.\nOn August 23, 2023, Johnson & Johnson completed the disposition of an additional 80.1% ownership of Kenvue Common\nStock through an exchange offer, which resulted in Johnson & Johnson acquiring 190,955,436shares of the Company’s\ncommon stock in exchange for 1,533,830,450shares of Kenvue Common Stock. The $ 31.4billion of Johnson & Johnson\ncommon stock received in the exchange offer is recorded in Treasury stock. Following the exchange offer, the\nCompany owns 9.5% of the total outstanding shares of Kenvue Common Stock that was recorded in other assets within\ncontinuing operations at the fair market value of $ 4.3billion as of August 23, 2023. Subsequent changes are\nreflected in other income/expense and amounted to $ 0.4billion expense through December 31, 2023.\nJohnson & Johnson divested net assets of $ 11.6billion as of August 23, 2023, and the accumulated other\ncomprehensive loss attributable to the Consumer Health business at that date was $ 4.3billion. Additionally, at the\ndate of the exchange offer, Johnson & Johnson decreased the non-controlling interest by $ 1.2billion to record the\ndeconsolidation of Kenvue. This resulted in a non-cash gain on the exchange offer of $ 21.0billion that was\nrecorded in Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of earnings for\nthe fiscal third quarter of 2023. This one-time gain includes a gain of $ 2.8billion on the Kenvue Common Stock\nretained by Johnson & Johnson.

The\nprovision of services under the TSAs generally will terminate within 24months following the Kenvue IPO.\nAdditionally, Johnson & Johnson and Kenvue entered into TMAs pursuant to which Johnson & Johnson will manufacture\nand supply to Kenvue certain products and, similarly, Kenvue will manufacture and supply to Johnson & Johnson\ncertain products. The terms of the TMAs range in initial duration from 3months to 5years.\nAmounts related to the TSAs and TMAs included in the consolidated statements of earnings were immaterial for the\nfiscal year 2023. Additionally, the amounts due to and from Kenvue for the above agreements was not material as of\nDecember 31, 2023.\nThe results of the Consumer Health business (previously reported as a separate business segment), as well as the\nassociated gain, have been reflected as discontinued operations in the Company’s consolidated statements of\nearnings as Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes. Prior periods have been recast to reflect this\npresentation. As a result of the separation of Kenvue, Johnson & Johnson incurred separation costs of $ 986million,\n$ 1,089million and $ 67million in the fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively, which are also included in\nNet earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes.

We\nalso have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023, based on\ncriteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2023 and January 1, 2023, and the results of its\noperations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended December 31, 2023 in\nconformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the\nCompany maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December\n31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\n106\nCritical audit matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves – managed care, medicare and medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $11.5 billion as of\nDecember 31, 2023. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nrebate programs, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical\nexperience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related\nto contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in\nthe U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing\nan independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend\nanalysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating\nthose claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and\n(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation contingencies – talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the\nCompany has settled cases. The Company has recognized a total provision of approximately $9 billion, of which\napproximately one-third is recorded as a current liability and which encompasses actual and contemplated\nsettlements. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable loss after the dismissal. The\nparties have not yet reached a full resolution of all talc matters and the Company is unable to estimate the\npossible loss or range of loss beyond the remaining amount accrued.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred, when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and existing\ntalc claims can be made, and when determining the timing of any settlement payments, which in turn led to a high\ndegree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment\nof the loss contingencies associated with this litigation.\n2023 Annual Report107\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) obtaining and evaluating certain executed\nsettlement agreements related to the talc litigation (iii) discussing the status of significant known actual and\npotential litigation and settlements activity with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as well as external\ncounsel when deemed necessary; (iv) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with internal and\nexternal legal counsel for significant litigation; (v) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s assessment\nregarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable; and (vi)\nevaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 16, 2024\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n108\nManagement’s report on internal control over financial reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of December 31, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of December\n31, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2023 has been\naudited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report,\nwhich appears herein.\n/s/J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and\nparticipated in this evaluation.

The Company continues to\nmonitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems.
