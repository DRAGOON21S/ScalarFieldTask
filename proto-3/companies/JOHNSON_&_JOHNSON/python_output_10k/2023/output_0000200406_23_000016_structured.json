          "content": "BUSINESS\nGeneral\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. Johnson &\nJohnson is a holding company, with operating companies conducting business in virtually all countries of the world.\nThe Company’s primary focus is products related to human health and well-being. Johnson & Johnson was incorporated\nin the State of New Jersey in 1887.\nThe Executive Committee of Johnson & Johnson is the principal management group responsible for the strategic\noperations and allocation of the resources of the Company.

Johnson & Johnson Vision products include ACUVUE Brand\ncontact lenses and ophthalmic technologies related to cataract and laser refractive surgery. These products are\ndistributed to wholesalers, hospitals and retailers, and used predominantly in the professional fields by\nphysicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals and clinics.\nGeographic Areas\nJohnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company) have approximately 152,700 employees worldwide engaged in the\nresearch and development, manufacture and sale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company\nconducts business in virtually all countries of the world with the primary focus on products related to human\nhealth and well-being.\nThe products made and sold in the international business include many of those described above under “– Segments of\nBusiness – Consumer Health,” “– Pharmaceutical” and “– MedTech.” However, the principal markets, products and\nmethods of distribution in the international business vary with the country and the culture. The products sold in\ninternational business include those developed in the U.S. and by subsidiaries abroad.\nInvestments and activities in some countries outside the U.S. are subject to higher risks than comparable U.S.\nactivities because the investment and commercial climate may be influenced by financial instability in\ninternational economies, restrictive economic policies and political and legal system uncertainties.\nRaw Materials\nRaw materials essential to the Company's business are generally readily available from multiple sources. Where\nthere are exceptions, the temporary unavailability of those raw materials would not likely have a material adverse\neffect on the financial results of the Company.\nPatents\nThe Company's subsidiaries have made a practice of obtaining patent protection on their products and processes\nwhere possible. They own, or are licensed under, a significant number of patents in the U.S. and other countries\nrelating to their products, product uses, formulations and manufacturing processes, which in the aggregate are\nbelieved to be of material importance to the Company in the operation of its businesses. The Company’s subsidiaries\nface patent challenges from third parties, including challenges seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company's key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. Significant legal proceedings and claims involving the Company's patent and other\nintellectual property are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings— Intellectual Property” of the Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nSales of the Company’s largest product, STELARA (ustekinumab), accounted for approximately 10.2% of the Company's\ntotal revenues for fiscal 2022. Accordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the\n2\nCompany. Janssen Biotech, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, owns patents specifically related\nto STELARA . The latest expiring United States composition of matter patent expires in 2023. The latest expiring\nEuropean composition of matter patent expires in 2024.\nSales of the Company’s second largest product, collectively DARZALEX (daratumumab) and DARZALEX FASPRO (daratumumab\nand hyaluronidase-fihj), accounted for approximately 8.4% of the Company's total revenues for fiscal 2022.\nAccordingly, the patents related to this product are believed to be material to the Company. Genmab A/S owns two\npatent families related to DARZALEX, and Janssen Biotech, Inc. has an exclusive license to those patent families.\nThe two patent families both expire in the United States in 2029. The latest expiring licensed European patent\nexpires in 2032. Janssen Biotech, Inc. owns a separate patent portfolio related to DARZALEX FASPRO.\nTrademarks\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have made a practice of selling their products under trademarks and of obtaining\nprotection for these trademarks by all available means. These trademarks are protected by registration in the U.S.\nand other countries where such products are marketed. The Company considers these trademarks in the aggregate to be\nof material importance in the operation of its businesses.\nSeasonality\nWorldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, spending has typically been heavier\nin the fourth quarter of each year than in other quarters. This reflects increased spending decisions, principally\nfor advertising and research and development activity.\nCompetition\nIn all of their product lines, the Company's subsidiaries compete with companies both locally and globally.\nCompetition exists in all product lines without regard to the number and size of the competing companies involved.\nCompetition in research, both internally and externally sourced, involving the development and the improvement of\nnew and existing products and processes, is particularly significant. The development of new and innovative\nproducts, as well as protecting the underlying intellectual property of the Company’s product portfolio, is\nimportant to the Company's success in all areas of its business. The competitive environment requires substantial\ninvestments in continuing research. In addition, the development and maintenance of customer demand for the\nCompany’s consumer products involve significant expenditures for advertising and promotion.\nEnvironment\nThe Company is subject to a variety of U.S. and international environmental protection measures. The Company\nbelieves that its operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.\nThe Company’s compliance with these requirements is not expected to have a material effect upon its capital\nexpenditures, cash flows, earnings or competitive position.\nRegulation\nThe Company’s businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which\noperations are conducted, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation and enforcement. The\nCompany is subject to costly and complex U.S. and foreign laws and governmental regulations and any adverse\nregulatory action may materially adversely affect the Company's financial condition and business operations. In the\nU.S., the drug, device and cosmetic industries have long been subject to regulation by various federal and state\nagencies, primarily as to product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The\nexercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the U.S. FDA) continues to result in\nincreases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for U.S. FDA approval of new drugs and devices and a\ncorresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Similar trends are also evident in major markets\noutside of the U.S. The new medical device regulatory framework and the evolving privacy, data localization, and\nemerging cyber security laws and regulations around the world are examples of such increased regulation. Five U.S.\nStates (California, Connecticut, Colorado, Utah and Virginia) now have comprehensive privacy laws in place and\nChina introduced broad personal information protection and data security regulations in 2022. With other\njurisdictions enacting similar privacy laws, local data protection authorities will force greater accountability on\nthe collection, access and use of personal data in the healthcare industry.\nThe regulatory agencies under whose purview the Company operates have administrative powers that may subject it to\nactions such as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions. In some\ncases, the Company’s subsidiaries may deem it advisable to initiate product recalls regardless of whether it has\nbeen required or directed to.\nThe U.S. FDA and regulatory agencies around the globe are also increasing their enforcement activities. If the U.S.\nFDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our drugs or\nmedical\n3\ndevices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the U.S. FDA could ban such products, detain or seize\nadulterated or misbranded products, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such products, refuse to\ngrant pending applications for marketing authorization or require certificates of foreign governments for exports,\nand/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the products present unreasonable risks of\nsubstantial harm to the public health. The U.S. FDA may also assess civil or criminal penalties against us, our\nofficers or employees and impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, or enjoin and/or restrain certain\nconduct resulting in violations of applicable law. The U.S. FDA may also recommend prosecution to the U.S.\nDepartment of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively\nmarketing and selling our products and limit our ability to obtain future clearances or approvals, and could result\nin a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. Equivalent enforcement mechanisms exist in\ndifferent countries in which we conduct business.\nThe costs of human healthcare have been and continue to be a subject of study, investigation and regulation by\ngovernmental agencies and legislative bodies around the world. In the U.S., attention has been focused by states,\nregulatory agencies and Congress on prices, profits, overutilization and the quality and costs of healthcare\ngenerally. Laws and regulations have been enacted to require adherence to strict compliance standards and prevent\nfraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. There is increased focus on interactions and financial relationships\nbetween healthcare companies and healthcare providers. Various transparency laws and regulations require\ndisclosures of payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals and, beginning with\ndisclosures in 2022, to certain non-physician practitioners. Federal and foreign laws governing international\nbusiness practices require strict compliance with anti-bribery standards and certain prohibitions with respect to\npayments to any foreign government official. Payers and Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) have become a more potent\nforce in the market place and increased attention is being paid to drug pricing and appropriate drug and medical\ndevice utilization.\nOur business has been and continues to be affected by federal and state legislation that alters the pricing,\ncoverage, and reimbursement landscape. At the federal level, in August 2022, President Biden signed into law the\nInflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes provisions that effectively authorize the government to establish\nprices for certain high-spend single-source drugs and biologics reimbursed by the Medicare program, starting in\n2026 for Medicare Part D drugs and 2028 for Medicare Part B drugs. It is not yet certain which products the federal\ngovernment will select and subject to government-established prices, or how the federal government will establish\nprices for selected products, as the IRA specifies a ceiling price but not a minimum price. One or more of our\nproducts could be selected and subject to the government-established price.\nThe IRA also contains provisions that impose rebates if certain prices increase at a rate that outpaces the rate of\ninflation, beginning October 1, 2022, for Medicare Part D drugs and January 1, 2023, for Medicare Part B drugs.\nSeparate IRA provisions redesign the Medicare Part D benefit in various ways, including by shifting a greater\nportion of costs to manufacturers within certain coverage phases and replacing the Part D coverage gap discount\nprogram with a new manufacturer discounting program. Failure to comply with IRA provisions may subject\nmanufacturers to various penalties, including civil monetary penalties. The impact of the IRA on our business and\nthe broader pharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as the federal government has yet to make various IRA\nimplementation decisions.\nAdditionally, we expect continued scrutiny on drug pricing and government price reporting from Congress, agencies,\nand other bodies at the federal and state levels.\nThere are a number of additional bills pending in Congress and healthcare reform proposals at the state level that\nwould affect drug pricing, including in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. This changing legal landscape has both\npositive and negative impacts on the U.S. healthcare industry with much remaining uncertain as to how various\nprovisions of federal and state law, and potential modification or repeal of these laws, will ultimately affect the\nindustry. The IRA and any other federal or state legislative change could affect the pricing and market conditions\nfor our products.\nIn addition, business practices in the healthcare industry have come under increased scrutiny, particularly in the\nU.S., by government agencies and state attorneys general, and resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the\nrisk of significant civil and criminal penalties. Of note is the increased enforcement activity by data protection\nauthorities in various jurisdictions, particularly in the European Union, where significant fines have been levied\non companies for data breaches, violations of privacy requirements, and unlawful cross-border data transfers. In\nthe U.S., the Federal Trade Commission has stepped up enforcement of data privacy with several significant\nsettlements and there have been a material increase in class-action lawsuits linked to the collection and use of\nbiometric data.\nFurther, the Company relies on global supply chains, and production and distribution processes, that are complex,\nare subject to increasing regulatory requirements, and may be faced with unexpected changes such as those resulting\nfrom the\n4\nCOVID-19 pandemic and Brexit that may affect sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in the Company's\nproducts. These processes also are subject to complex and lengthy regulatory approvals.\nEmployees and Human Capital Management\nAs of January 1, 2023, and January 2, 2022, the number of employees were approximately:\n2022       2021\nEmployees1                               155,800    144,300\nFull-time equivalent (FTE) positions2    152,700    141,700\n1 “Employee” is defined as an individual working full-time or part-time, excluding fixed term employees, interns\nand co-op employees. Employee data may not include full population from more recently acquired companies and\nindividuals on long-term disability are excluded. Contingent workers, contractors and subcontractors are also\nexcluded. Abiomed headcount has been included in the above table.\n2 FTE represents the total number of full-time equivalent positions and does not reflect the total number of\nindividual employees as some work part-time.\nStrategy\nThe Company believes that its employees are critical to its continued success and are an essential element of its\nlong-term strategy. Management is responsible for ensuring that its policies and processes reflect and reinforce\nthe Company's desired corporate culture, including policies and processes related to strategy, risk management, and\nethics and compliance. The Company’s human capital management strategy is built on three fundamental focus areas:\nAttracting and recruiting the best talent\nDeveloping and retaining talent\nEmpowering and inspiring talent\nUnderpinning these focus areas are ongoing efforts to cultivate and foster a culture built on diversity, equity and\ninclusion (DEI), innovation, health, well-being and safety, where the Company's employees are encouraged to succeed\nboth professionally and personally while helping the Company achieve its business goals.\nCulture and Employee Engagement\nAt the Company, employees are guided by Our Credo which sets forth the Company's responsibilities to patients,\nconsumers, customers, healthcare professionals, employees, communities and shareholders. Employees worldwide must\nadhere to the Company’s Code of Business Conduct which sets basic requirements and serves as a foundation for the\nCompany policies, procedures and guidelines, all of which provide additional guidance on expected employee\nbehaviors in every market where it operates. The Company c onducts global surveys that offer its employees the\nability to provide feedback and valuable insight to help address potential human resources risks and identify\nopportunities to improve. In 2022, 92% of global employees across 77 countries participated in Our Credo Survey\nwhich was offered in 36 languages .\n5\nGrowth and Development\nTo continue to lead in the changing healthcare landscape, it is crucial that the Company continue to attract and\nretain top talent. The Company believes that its employees must be equipped with the right knowledge and skills and\nbe provided with opportunities to grow and develop in their careers. Accordingly, professional development programs\nand educational resources\nare available to all employees. The Company's objective is to foster a learning culture that helps shape each\nperson’s unique career path while creating a robust pipeline of talent to deliver on the Company’s long-term\nstrategies. In furtherance of this objective, the Company deploys a global approach to ensure development is for\neveryone, regardless of where they are on their career journey. In 2022, 46.2% of employees in Manager and above\njob categories who had movements (including upward promotions or lateral transfers) took advantage of career\nopportunities by moving across functions, country or business segment lines (excluding employees in the research\nand development organizations). The Company's voluntary turnover rate was 9%.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI)\nThe Company is committed to workplace diversity and to cultivating, fostering, and advancing a culture of equity\nand inclusion. In 2022, Johnson & Johnson introduced the Company’s evolved enterprise Diversity, Equity and\nInclusion strategy, which recognizes how DEI accelerates the Company’s ability to meet the changing needs of the\ncommunities the Company serves to deliver Our Purpose to profoundly change the trajectory of health for humanity.\nThe Company’s DEI vision is: Be yourself, change the world. The Company’s DEI Mission is: Make diversity, equity\nand inclusion how we work everyday . Our evolved enterprise DEI Strategy is aligned to our DEI Vision and Mission\nand rests on four core pillars:\nAccelerate our global culture of inclusion where every individual belongs\nBuild a workforce that reflects the diversity of our communities\nTransform talent and business processes to achieve equitable access and outcomes for all\nDrive innovation and growth with our business to serve diverse markets around the world\nThe Company’s DEI strategy is guided by internal and external insights, global best practices and continual\nemployee feedback which remind the Company that while diversity changes by location, inclusion is the same\neverywhere.\nCompensation and Benefits\nAs part of the Company's total rewards philosophy, the Company offers competitive compensation and benefits to\nattract and retain top talent. The Company is committed to fairness and equitable treatment in its compensation and\nbenefits for employees at all levels. The Company observes legal minimum wage provisions and exceeds them where\npossible. The Company's total rewards offerings include an array of programs to support its employees' well-being,\nincluding annual performance incentive opportunities, pension and retirement savings programs, health and welfare\nbenefits, paid time off, leave programs, flexible work schedules and employee assistance programs. In recognition\nof the Company’s commitment to help employees balance their personal and professional responsibilities, the Company\nextended its paid parental leave benefit globally from 8 to 12 weeks for all eligible employees. In the U.S., the\nbenefit was effective on January 1, 2022, with retroactive coverage for new family additions as of July 1, 2021.\nHealth, Wellness and Safety\nThe Company’s investment in employee health, well-being and safety is built on its conviction that advancing health\nfor humanity starts with advancing the health of its employees. With the right awareness, focus, practices and\ntools, the Company ensures that all its employees around the world, as well as temporary contractors and visitors\nto the Company's sites, can work safely. The Company has continuously expanded health and well-being programs\nthroughout the Company and across the globe, incorporating new thinking and technologies to keep its offerings\nbest-in-class and to help employees achieve their personal health goals. The programs and practices the Company\nadvances for total health—physical, mental, emotional and financial—ensure employee health protection for emerging\nhealth risks. Protecting and supporting our employees as the COVID-19 pandemic has evolved continues to be a top\npriority and the Company’s approach includes: ensuring the health and safety of our employees in the workplace\nthrough robust layers of protection; enhanced cleaning and access to cleaning supplies and personal protective\nequipment; supporting employees with benefits and well-being tools. The Company continues to address our employees\nneeds through J&J Flex, a hybrid model that empowers the Company’s office-based employees to find the right\nproductivity and balance of in-person and remote work.\n6\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s main corporate website address is www.jnj.com .

          "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in the Company’s common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. The Company seeks\nto identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, but uncertainties and risks are difficult to predict and\nmany are outside of the Company’s control and cannot therefore be eliminated. In addition to the other information\nin this report and the Company’s other filings with the SEC, investors should consider carefully the factors set\nforth below. Investors should be aware that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and that the\nfollowing is not meant to be a complete discussion of all potential risks or uncertainties. If known or unknown\nrisks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s business, results of operations or financial condition could be\nadversely affected, potentially in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\nThe Company’s businesses operate in highly competitive product markets and competitive pressures could adversely\naffect the Company’s earnings.\nThe Company faces substantial competition in all three operating segments and in all geographic markets. The\nCompany’s businesses compete with companies of all sizes on the basis of cost-effectiveness, technological\ninnovations, intellectual property rights, product performance, real or perceived product advantages, pricing and\navailability and rate of reimbursement. The Company also competes with other market participants in securing rights\nto acquisitions, collaborations and licensing agreements with third parties. Competition for rights to product\ncandidates and technologies may result in significant investment and acquisition costs and onerous agreement terms\nfor the Company. Competitors’ development of more effective or less costly products, and/or their ability to secure\npatent and other intellectual property rights and successfully market products ahead of the Company, could\nnegatively impact sales of the Company’s existing products as well as its ability to bring new products to market\ndespite significant prior investment in the related product development.\nFor the Company’s Pharmaceutical businesses, loss of patent exclusivity for a product often is followed by a\nsubstantial reduction in sales as competitors gain regulatory approval for generic and other competing products and\nenter the market. Similar competition can be triggered by the loss of exclusivity for a biological product. For the\nCompany’s MedTech businesses, technological innovation, product quality, reputation and customer service are\nespecially important to competitiveness. Development by other companies of new or improved products, processes and\ntechnologies could threaten to make the Company’s products or technologies less desirable, less economical or\nobsolete. The Company’s Consumer Health businesses face intense competition from other branded products and\nretailers’ private-label brands. If the Company fails to sufficiently differentiate and market its brand name\nconsumer products, this could adversely affect revenues and profitability of those products.\nInterruptions and delays in manufacturing operations could adversely affect the Company’s business, sales and\nreputation.\nThe Company’s manufacture of products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of complex, high-quality\ncomponents and materials. The Company’s subsidiaries operate 89 manufacturing facilities as well as sourcing from\nthousands of suppliers around the world. The Company has in the past, and may in the future, face unanticipated\ninterruptions and delays in manufacturing through its internal or external supply chain. Manufacturing disruptions\ncan occur for many reasons including regulatory action, production quality deviations or safety issues, labor\ndisputes, labor shortages, site-specific incidents (such as fires), natural disasters such as hurricanes and other\nsevere weather events, raw material shortages, political unrest, terrorist attacks and epidemics or pandemics. Such\ndelays and difficulties in manufacturing can result in product shortages, declines in sales and reputational impact\nas well as significant remediation and related costs associated with addressing the shortage.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. Any failure by or loss of a third-party\nmanufacturer could result in delays and increased costs, which may adversely affect our business.\nThe Company relies on third parties to manufacture certain of our products. We depend on these third-party\nmanufacturers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs, to produce\nproducts of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields and to deliver those products to us on a\ntimely basis and at acceptable prices. However, we cannot guarantee that these third-party manufacturers will be\nable to meet our near-term or long-term manufacturing requirements, which could result in lost sales and have an\nadverse effect on our business.\nOther risks associated with our reliance on third parties to manufacture these products include reliance on the\nthird party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, misappropriation of the Company’s intellectual\nproperty, limited ability to manage our inventory, possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third\nparty and the possible termination or nonrenewal of the manufacturing agreement by the third party at a time that\nis costly or inconvenient for us. Moreover, if any of our third-party manufacturers suffers any damage to\nfacilities, loses benefits under material agreements, experiences power outages, encounters financial difficulties,\nis unable to secure necessary raw materials from its suppliers or suffers any other reduction in efficiency, the\nCompany may experience significant business disruption. In the event of any such disruption, the\n8\nCompany would need to seek and source other qualified third-party manufacturers, likely resulting in further delays\nand increased costs which could affect our business adversely.\nCounterfeit versions of our products could harm our patients and have a negative impact on our revenues, earnings,\nreputation and business.\nOur industry continues to be challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and\nthe presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the Internet. Third parties may\nillegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products, which do not meet our rigorous manufacturing\nand testing standards. To distributors and patients, counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from\nthe authentic version. Counterfeit medicines pose a risk to patient health and safety because of the conditions\nunder which they are manufactured – often in unregulated, unlicensed, uninspected and unsanitary sites – as well as\nthe lack of regulation of their contents.\nThe industry’s failure to mitigate the threat of counterfeit medicines could adversely impact our business and\nreputation by impacting patient confidence in our authentic products, potentially resulting in lost sales, product\nrecalls, and an increased threat of litigation. In addition, diversion of our products from their authorized market\ninto other channels may result in reduced revenues and negatively affect our profitability.\nGlobal health crises, pandemics, epidemics, or other outbreaks could adversely disrupt or impact certain aspects of\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to risks associated with global health crises, epidemics, pandemics and other outbreaks (such\nincident(s), a health crisis or health crises), including the global outbreak of coronavirus and its variants\n(COVID-19). The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, certain aspects of\nthe Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including lower sales and reduced customer\ndemand and usage of certain of our products. The continued spread of COVID-19 or other health crises may cause the\nCompany to modify its business practices, and take further actions as may be required by government authorities or\nas the Company determines are in the best interests of our patients, customers, employees and business partners.\nWhile the Company has robust business continuity plans in place across our global supply chain network to help\nmitigate the impact of health crises, these efforts may not completely prevent our business from being adversely\naffected and future impacts remain uncertain.\nWhile the U.S. and other countries have substantially reopened their economies, the extent to which COVID-19, or\nother health crises, could impact the Company’s future operations will depend on many factors which cannot be\npredicted with confidence, including the duration of an outbreak and impact of variants. A surge in COVID-19 or\nother health crises could result in the imposition of new mandates and prolonged restrictive measures implemented\nin order to control the spread of disease. The global spread of COVID-19 or other health crises could adversely\nimpact the Company’s operations, including, among other things, our manufacturing operations, supply chain, third-\nparty suppliers, sales and marketing, and clinical trial operations. Any of these factors could adversely affect\nthe Company’s business, financial results, and global economic conditions generally.\nWe also face uncertainties related to our vaccine development programs, including uncertainties related to the risk\nthat our continued development programs may not be successful, commercially viable or receive approval from\nregulatory authorities; risks associated with clinical trial and real-world data, including further analyses of its\nefficacy, safety and durability; the risk that continued evolution and mutation of disease and the duration of a\nparticular outbreak may impede our ability to conduct trials within a specified time frame; the risk that data are\nsubject to differing interpretations and assessments, including during the peer review/publication process, in the\nscientific community generally, and by national immunization technical advisory groups (NITAGs) and regulatory\nauthorities; disruptions in the relationships between us, our third-party suppliers, external manufacturers, and\nother third parties with whom we engage; the risk that other companies may produce superior or competitive\nproducts; the risk that demand for any products we may develop may no longer exist; risks related to the\navailability of raw materials to manufacture any such products; the risk that we may not be able to recoup costs\nassociated with our R&D and manufacturing efforts and risks associated with any changes in the way we approach or\nprovide additional research funding for potential drug development; the risk that we may not be able to create or\nscale up manufacturing capacity on a timely basis, that we may continue to experience manufacturing delays once a\nmanufacturing site is activated, or have access to logistics or supply channels commensurate with global demand for\nany potential approved vaccine or product candidate, which would negatively impact our ability to supply the\nestimated numbers of doses of our vaccine within the projected time periods indicated, and other challenges and\nrisks associated with the pace of our vaccine development program; and pricing and access challenges for such\nproducts, including in the U.S.\nRisks Related to Government Regulation and Legal Proceedings\nGlobal sales in the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech segments may be negatively impacted by healthcare reforms\nand increasing pricing pressures.\n9\nSales of the Company’s Pharmaceutical and MedTech products are significantly affected by reimbursements by third-\nparty payers such as government healthcare programs, private insurance plans and managed care organizations. As\npart of various efforts to contain healthcare costs, these payers are putting downward pressure on prices at which\nproducts will be reimbursed. In the U.S., increased purchasing power of entities that negotiate on behalf of\nMedicare, Medicaid, and private sector beneficiaries, in part due to continued consolidation among healthcare\nproviders, could result in further pricing pressures. In addition, recent legislation and ongoing political\nscrutiny or pricing, coverage and reimbursement could result in additional pricing pressures. Specifically, the\nInflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) may subject certain products to government-established pricing, potentially\nimpose rebates, and subject manufacturers who fail to adhere to the government's interpretations of the law to\npenalties. Outside the U.S., numerous major markets, including the EU, United Kingdom, Japan and China, have\npervasive government involvement in funding healthcare and, in that regard, directly or indirectly impose price\ncontrols, limit access to, or reimbursement for, the Company’s products, or reduce the value of its intellectual\nproperty protection.\nThe Company is subject to significant legal proceedings that can result in significant expenses, fines and\nreputational damage.\nIn the ordinary course of business, Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries are subject to numerous claims and\nlawsuits involving various issues such as product liability, patent disputes and claims that their product sales,\nmarketing and pricing practices violate various antitrust, unfair trade practices and/or consumer protection laws.\nThe Company’s more significant legal proceedings are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings” under Notes to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report. Litigation, in general, and securities,\nderivative action, class action and multi-district litigation, in particular, can be expensive and disruptive. Some\nof these matters may include thousands of plaintiffs, may involve parties seeking large and/or indeterminate\namounts, including punitive or exemplary damages, and may remain unresolved for several years. For example, the\nCompany is a defendant in numerous lawsuits arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and the Company’s sale, manufacturing and marketing of opioids. While the Company believes\nit has substantial defenses in these matters, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome of litigation. The\nCompany could in the future be required to pay significant amounts as a result of settlements or judgments in these\nmatters, potentially in excess of accruals, including matters where the Company could be held jointly and severally\nliable among other defendants. The resolution of, or increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any\nreporting period could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for\nthat period. The Company does not purchase third-party product liability insurance; however, the Company utilizes a\nwholly owned captive insurance company subject to certain limits.\nProduct reliability, safety and effectiveness concerns can have significant negative impacts on sales and results\nof operations, lead to litigation and cause reputational damage.\nConcerns about product safety, whether raised internally or by litigants, regulators or consumer advocates, and\nwhether or not based on scientific evidence, can result in safety alerts, product recalls, governmental\ninvestigations, regulatory action on the part of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (or its counterpart in other\ncountries), private claims and lawsuits, payment of fines and settlements, declining sales and reputational damage.\nThese circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in the Company’s\nproducts. Product recalls have in the past, and could in the future, prompt government investigations and\ninspections, the shutdown of manufacturing facilities, continued product shortages and related sales declines,\nsignificant remediation costs, reputational damage, possible civil penalties and criminal prosecution.\nThe Company faces significant regulatory scrutiny, which imposes significant compliance costs and exposes the\nCompany to government investigations, legal actions and penalties.\nLike other companies in the healthcare industry, the Company is subject to extensive regulation, investigations and\nlegal action by national, state and local government agencies in the U.S. and other countries in which it operates.\nRegulatory issues regarding compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) (and comparable quality\nregulations in foreign countries) by manufacturers of drugs, devices and consumer products can lead to fines and\npenalties, product recalls, product shortages, interruptions in production, delays in new product approvals and\nlitigation. In addition, the marketing, pricing and sale of the Company’s products are subject to regulation,\ninvestigations and legal actions including under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Medicaid Rebate\nProgram, federal and state false claims acts, state unfair trade practices acts and consumer protection laws.\nScrutiny of healthcare industry business practices by government agencies and state attorneys general in the U.S.,\nand any resulting investigations and prosecutions, carry risk of significant civil and criminal penalties\nincluding, but not limited to, debarment from participation in government healthcare programs. Any such debarment\ncould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The most significant\ncurrent investigations and litigation brought by government agencies are described in Note 19, “Legal\nProceedings—Government Proceedings” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this\nReport.\nChanges in tax laws or exposures to additional tax liabilities could negatively impact the Company’s operating\nresults.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations around the world, including in the U.S. and as led by the Organization for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, such as the recent adoption by the EU, enactment by South Korea and the\nanticipated enactment\n10\nby additional countries of a global minimum tax, could negatively impact the Company’s effective tax rate and\nresults of operations. A change in statutory tax rate or certain international tax provisions in any country would\nresult in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular\njurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit\nrecorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they\narise in the countries where it operates. Changes to tax laws or regulations may occur at any time, and any related\nexpense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nSee Note 8, “Income Taxes” under Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report\nfor additional information.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and is addressing tax audits and disputes\nwith many tax authorities. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are required to disclose\nmore information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of\nprofits earned in other countries. The Company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of its tax audits and\ndisputes to determine the appropriateness of its tax reserves. However, any tax authority could take a position on\ntax treatment that is contrary to the Company’s expectations, which could result in tax liabilities in excess of\nreserves.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nThe Company faces increased challenges to intellectual property rights central to its business.\nThe Company owns or licenses a significant number of patents and other proprietary rights relating to its products\nand manufacturing processes. These rights are essential to the Company’s businesses and materially important to the\nCompany’s results of operations. Public policy, both within and outside the U.S., has become increasingly\nunfavorable toward intellectual property rights. The Company cannot be certain that it will obtain adequate patent\nprotection for new products and technologies in the United States and other important markets or that such\nprotections, once granted, will last as long as originally anticipated.\nCompetitors routinely challenge the validity or extent of the Company’s owned or licensed patents and proprietary\nrights through litigation, interferences, oppositions and other proceedings, such as inter partes review (IPR)\nproceedings before the United States Patent & Trademark Office (USPTO). These proceedings absorb resources and can\nbe protracted as well as unpredictable. In addition, challenges that the Company’s products infringe the patents of\nthird parties could result in an injunction and/or the need to pay past damages and future royalties and adversely\naffect the competitive position and sales of the products in question.\nThe Company has faced increasing patent challenges from third parties seeking to manufacture and market generic and\nbiosimilar versions of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents\ncovering those products. In the U.S., manufacturers of generic versions of innovative human pharmaceutical products\nmay challenge the validity, or claim non-infringement, of innovator products through the Abbreviated New Drug\nApplication, or ANDA, process with the U.S. FDA and related ANDA litigation. The Biologics Price Competition and\nInnovation Act (BPCIA), enacted in 2010, which created a new regulatory pathway for the approval by the U.S. FDA of\nbiosimilar alternatives to innovator-developed biological products, also created mechanisms for biosimilar\napplicants to challenge the patents on the innovator biologics. The IPR process with the USPTO is also being used\nby competitors to challenge patents asserted in litigation.\nIn the event the Company is not successful in defending its patents against such challenges, or upon the “at-risk”\nlaunch by the generic or biosimilar firm of its product, the Company can lose a major portion of revenues for the\nreferenced product in a very short period of time. Current legal proceedings involving the Company’s patents and\nother intellectual property rights are described in Note 19, “Legal Proceedings—Intellectual Property” under Notes\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this Report.\nRisks Related to Product Development, Regulatory Approval and Commercialization\nSignificant challenges or delays in the Company’s innovation and development of new products, technologies and\nindications could have an adverse impact on the Company’s long-term success.\nThe Company’s continued growth and success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new and differentiated\nproducts and services that address the evolving healthcare needs of patients, providers and consumers. Development\nof successful products and technologies is also necessary to offset revenue losses when the Company’s existing\nproducts lose market share due to various factors such as competition and loss of patent exclusivity. New products\nintroduced within the past five years\n11\naccounted for approximately 25% of 2022 sales. The Company cannot be certain when or whether it will be able to\ndevelop, license or otherwise acquire companies, products and technologies, whether particular product candidates\nwill be granted regulatory approval, and, if approved, whether the products will be commercially successful.\nThe Company pursues product development through internal research and development as well as through\ncollaborations, acquisitions, joint ventures and licensing or other arrangements with third parties. In all of\nthese contexts, developing new products, particularly pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and medical\ndevices, requires significant investment of resources over many years. Only a very few biopharmaceutical research\nand development programs result in commercially viable products. The process depends on many factors including the\nability to: discern patients’ and healthcare providers’ future needs; develop promising new compounds, strategies\nand technologies; achieve successful clinical trial results; secure effective intellectual property protection;\nobtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis; and, if and when they reach the market, successfully differentiate\nthe Company’s products from competing products and approaches to treatment. New products or enhancements to\nexisting products may not be accepted quickly or significantly in the marketplace due to product and price\ncompetition, changes in customer preferences or healthcare purchasing patterns, resistance by healthcare providers\nor uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Even following initial regulatory approval, the success of a product\ncan be adversely impacted by safety and efficacy findings in larger real-world patient populations, as well as\nmarket entry of competitive products.\nRisks Related to Financial and Economic Market Conditions\nThe Company faces a variety of financial, economic, legal, social and political risks associated with conducting\nbusiness internationally .\nThe Company’s extensive operations and business activity throughout the world are accompanied by certain financial,\neconomic, legal, social and political risks, including those listed below.\nForeign Currency Exchange : In fiscal 2022, approximately 49% of the Company’s sales occurred outside of the U.S.,\nwith approximately 25% in Europe, 6% in the Western Hemisphere, excluding the U.S., and 18% in the Asia-Pacific and\nAfrica region. Changes in non-U.S. currencies relative to the U.S. dollar impact the Company’s revenues and\nexpenses. While the Company uses financial instruments to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in currency exchange\nrates on its cash flows, unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the\nweakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar may result in significant favorable or unfavorable translation\neffects when the operating results of the Company’s non-U.S. business activity are translated into U.S. dollars.\nInflation and Currency Devaluation Risks : The Company faces challenges in maintaining profitability of operations\nin economies experiencing high inflation rates. Specifically, the Company has accounted for operations in\nArgentina, Turkey and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed\n100%. While the Company strives to maintain profit margins in these areas through cost reduction programs,\nproductivity improvements and periodic price increases, it might experience operating losses as a result of\ncontinued inflation. In addition, the impact of currency devaluations in countries experiencing high inflation\nrates or significant currency exchange fluctuations could negatively impact the Company’s operating results.\nIllegal Importation of Pharmaceutical Products : The illegal importation of pharmaceutical products from countries\nwhere government price controls or other market dynamics result in lower prices may adversely affect the Company’s\nsales and profitability in the U.S. and other countries in which the Company operates. With the exception of\nlimited quantities of prescription drugs for personal use, foreign imports of pharmaceutical products are illegal\nunder current U.S. law. However, the volume of illegal imports continues to rise as the ability of patients and\nother customers to obtain the lower-priced imports has grown significantly.\nAnti-Bribery and Other Regulations: The Company is subject to various federal and foreign laws that govern its\ninternational business practices with respect to payments to government officials. Those laws include the U.S.\nForeign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which prohibits U.S. publicly traded companies from promising, offering, or\ngiving anything of value to foreign officials with the corrupt intent of influencing the foreign official for the\npurpose of helping the Company obtain or retain business or gain any improper advantage. The Company’s business is\nheavily regulated and therefore involves significant interaction with foreign officials. Also, in many countries\noutside the U.S., the healthcare providers who prescribe human pharmaceuticals are employed by the government and\nthe purchasers of human pharmaceuticals are government entities; therefore, the Company’s interactions with these\nprescribers and purchasers are subject to regulation under the FCPA. In addition to the U.S. application and\nenforcement of the FCPA, various jurisdictions in which the Company operates have laws\n12\nand regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, aimed at preventing and penalizing corrupt and\nanticompetitive behavior. Enforcement activities under these laws could subject the Company to additional\nadministrative and legal proceedings and actions, which could include claims for civil penalties, criminal\nsanctions, and administrative remedies, including exclusion from healthcare programs.\nOther Financial, Economic, Legal, Social and Political Risks . Other risks inherent in conducting business globally\ninclude:\nlocal and regional economic environments and policies in the markets that we serve, including interest rates,\nmonetary policy, inflation, economic growth, recession, commodity prices, and currency controls or other\nlimitations on the ability to expatriate cash;\nprotective economic policies taken by governments, such as trade protection measures and import/export licensing\nrequirements;\ncompliance with local regulations and laws including, in some countries, regulatory requirements restricting the\nCompany’s ability to manufacture or sell its products in the relevant market;\ndiminished protection of intellectual property and contractual rights in certain jurisdictions;\npotential nationalization or expropriation of the Company’s foreign assets;\npolitical or social upheavals, economic instability, repression, or human rights issues; and\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, disruptions to markets due to war, armed conflict, terrorism,\nepidemics or pandemics.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory credit rating could adversely affect our liquidity, capital position, borrowing\ncosts and access to capital markets.\nWe currently maintain investment grade credit ratings with Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s Ratings\nServices. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based\non a number of factors. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, whether as a result of our\nactions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase the cost of borrowing under any indebtedness we may\nincur, reduce market capacity for our commercial paper or require the posting of additional collateral under our\nderivative contracts. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our credit ratings, and any\nadditional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our\nratings are under review for a downgrade, may have a negative impact on our liquidity, capital position and access\nto capital markets.\nThe Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War, could adversely affect our\nbusiness, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn February 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing Russia-Ukraine War has provoked\nstrong reactions from the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and various other countries and\neconomic and political organizations around the world. We have been monitoring the geopolitical situation in Russia\nsince the start of the Russia-Ukraine War and have suspended additional investment, enrollment of clinical trials,\nand supply of our personal care products in Russia. We continue to monitor the need for humanitarian relief in the\nregion and continue to supply our medicines, medical devices and equipment in the region in compliance with the\napplicable sanctions. We will continue to monitor the geopolitical situation in Russia and to evaluate our\nactivities and future operations in Russia.\nActions taken in response to the Russia-Ukraine War include the imposition of export controls and broad financial\nand economic sanctions against Russia, Belarus and specific areas of Ukraine. Additional sanctions or other\nmeasures may be imposed by the global community, including but not limited to limitations on our ability to file,\nprosecute and maintain patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, the Russian\ngovernment has already taken action allowing Russian companies and individuals to exploit inventions owned by\npatent holders from the United States and many other countries without consent or compensation and we may not be\nable to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in Russia or from selling or importing products in and\ninto Russia.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, other risks related to the broad economic consequences\nof the Russia-Ukraine War, including foreign currency volatility, decreased demand for our products in countries\naffected by the Russia-Ukraine War and challenges to our global supply chain related to increased costs of\nmaterials and other inputs for our products and suppliers operating in Russia and Ukraine. We also continue to\nmonitor the various sanctions and export controls imposed in response to the Russia-Ukraine War.\nThe full impact of the Russia-Ukraine War, and actions taken in response to the ongoing conflict, on the global\neconomy and geopolitical relations, in general, and on our business in particular, remain uncertain. Any or all of\nthe foregoing risks could\n13\nhave an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition, particularly as the conflict\ncontinues for an indefinite period of time. Given that developments concerning the Russia-Ukraine War are ongoing\nand have been constantly evolving, additional impacts and risks may arise that are not presently known to us. The\nRussia-Ukraine War may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors”\nsection.\nRisks Related to the Planned Separation of our Consumer Health Business\nThe planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business may not be completed on the terms or timeline\ncurrently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the expected results.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business, with the\nintention to create a standalone publicly traded company, which was subsequently named Kenvue, Inc. (\"Kenvue\"). The\nplanned separation is intended to qualify as a tax-free transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The\nCompany is targeting completion of the planned separation in 2023. Completion of the planned separation will be\nsubject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including, among others, consultations with works councils and\nother employee representative bodies, as required, final approval by the Company’s Board of Directors, the\ncontinuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service\n(“IRS”) and receipt of favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors with respect to the tax-free nature of\nthe transaction, and the receipt of other regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance regarding the ultimate\ntiming of the planned separation or that such separation will be completed. Unanticipated developments could delay,\nprevent or otherwise adversely affect the planned separation, including but not limited to disruptions in general\nor financial market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory and tax approvals or\nclearances.\nThe costs to complete the planned separation will be significant. In addition, the Company may be unable to achieve\nsome or all of the strategic and financial benefits that it expects to achieve from the planned separation of the\nCompany’s Consumer Health business.\nThe Company has incurred, and is expected to incur, significant expenses in connection with the planned separation.\nIn addition, the Company may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits that are expected to\nresult from the planned separation. The anticipated benefits of the planned separation are based on a number of\nassumptions, some of which may prove incorrect.\nFollowing the planned separation, the price of shares of the Company’s common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe Company cannot predict the effect of the planned separation on the trading price of shares of its common stock,\nand the market value of shares of its common stock may be less than, equal to or greater than the market value of\nshares of its common stock prior to the planned separation. In addition, the price of the Company’s common stock\nmay be more volatile around the time of the planned separation.\nThe planned separation could result in substantial tax liability.\nThe Company has received a private letter ruling from the IRS as to the tax-free nature of the planned separation\nunder the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The planned separation is conditioned on, among other\nthings, the continuing effectiveness and validity of the Company's private letter ruling from the IRS and receipt\nof favorable opinions of the Company's U.S. tax advisors. The private letter ruling and opinions will be based on,\namong other things, various facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from the Company and Kenvue\nregarding the past and future conduct of the companies’ respective businesses and other matters. If any of these\nfacts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, the Company and its\nshareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling or the opinions of tax advisors. Notwithstanding the private\nletter ruling and opinions of tax advisors, if subsequent to the planned separation the IRS determines that certain\nsteps of the transaction do not qualify for tax-free treatment for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the resulting\ntax liability to the Company and its shareholders could be substantial. The planned separation may also not qualify\nfor tax-free treatment in other countries around the world, and as a result may trigger substantial tax liability\nto the Company.\nOther Risks\nOur business depends on our ability to recruit and retain talented, highly skilled employees and a diverse\nworkforce.\nOur continued growth requires us to recruit and retain talented employees representing diverse backgrounds,\nexperiences, and skill sets. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely\ncompetitive and our ability to compete depends on our ability to hire, develop and motivate highly skilled\npersonnel in all areas of our organization. Maintaining our brand and reputation, as well as a diverse, equitable\nand inclusive work environment enables us to attract top talent. If we are less successful in our recruiting\nefforts, or if we cannot retain highly skilled workers and key leaders, our ability to develop and deliver\nsuccessful products and services may be adversely affected. In addition, effective succession planning is important\nto our long-term success. Any unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans or failure to ensure effective\ntransfer of\n14\nknowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nor results of operations.\nClimate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business\nand results of operations.\nClimate change resulting from increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the\natmosphere could present risks to our operations, including an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather\npatterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. Natural disasters and extreme\nweather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may pose physical risks to our\nfacilities and disrupt the operation of our supply chain. The impacts of the changing climate on water resources\nmay result in water scarcity, limiting our ability to access sufficient high-quality water in certain locations,\nwhich may increase operational costs.\nConcern over climate change may also result in new or additional legal or regulatory requirements designed to\nreduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. If such laws or\nregulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruption in, or an\nincrease in the costs associated with sourcing, manufacturing and distribution of our products, which may adversely\naffect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, the impacts of climate change have an\ninfluence on customer preferences, and failure to provide climate-friendly products could potentially result in\nloss of market share.\nAn information security incident, including a cybersecurity breach, could have a negative impact to the Company’s\nbusiness or reputation.\nTo meet business objectives, the Company relies on both internal information technology (IT) systems and networks,\nand those of third parties and their vendors, to process and store sensitive data, including confidential research,\nbusiness plans, financial information, intellectual property, and personal data that may be subject to legal\nprotection, and ensure the continuity of the Company’s supply chain. The extensive information security and\ncybersecurity threats, which affect companies globally, pose a risk to the security and availability of these\nsystems and networks, and the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Company’s sensitive data. The\nCompany continually assesses these threats and makes investments to increase internal protection, detection, and\nresponse capabilities, as well as ensure the Company’s third-party providers have required capabilities and\ncontrols, to address this risk . To date, the Company has not experienced any material impact to the business or\noperations resulting from information or cybersecurity attacks; however, because of the frequently changing attack\ntechniques, along with the increased volume and sophistication of the attacks, there is the potential for the\nCompany to be adversely impacted. This impact could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other\nbusiness harm as well as financial costs and regulatory action. The Company maintains cybersecurity insurance in\nthe event of an information security or cyber incident; however, the coverage may not be sufficient to cover all\nfinancial, legal, business or reputational losses.\nAs a result of the Russia-Ukraine War, there has been, and we expect there will continue to be, an increased risk\nof information security or cybersecurity incidents, including cyberattacks perpetrated by Russia or others at its\ndirection. Although we have taken steps to enhance our protections against these attacks, we may not be able to\naddress the threat of information security or cybersecurity incidents proactively or implement adequate\npreventative measures and we may not be able to detect and address any such disruption or security breach promptly,\nor at all, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.

Employees are\nempowered and inspired to lead with Our Credo and purpose as guides. This allows every employee to use the\nCompany’s reach and size to advance the Company’s purpose, and to also lead with agility and urgency. Leveraging\nthe extensive resources across the enterprise enables the Company to innovate and execute with excellence.

Operational growth was\nprimarily attributable to increased Cough/Cold/Flu, adult and pediatric incidences, price actions primarily in the\nU.S. and increased consumption in China due to easing of COVID-19 restrictions. Growth was partially offset by\nsupply constraints.\nThe Skin Health/Beauty franchise sales of $4.4 billion declined 4.2% as compared to the prior year. The operational\ndecline was driven by supply constraints in the U.S. partially offset by price actions and strong new product\nperformance in the Asia Pacific and Latin America region.\nThe Oral Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion declined 8.5% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline\nwas due to portfolio simplification in the U.S., competitive pressures in EMEA and China, category decline and\npricing pressures in EMEA, as well as suspension of personal care sales in Russia and negative COVID-19 impacts in\nChina.\nThe Baby Care franchise sales of $1.5 billion declined 6.7% as compared to the prior year. The operational decline\nwas driven by category deceleration and competitive pressures in the U.S., suspension of personal care sales in\nRussia and weakness in India.\nThe Women’s Health franchise sales of $0.9 billion declined 1.5% as compared to the prior year.

Operational growth was driven by strong uptake of STELARA (ustekinumab) in Crohn's disease and\nUlcerative Colitis and strength of TREMFYA (guselkumab) in Psoriasis and uptake in Psoriatic Arthritis. This was\npartially offset by lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nThe latest expiring United States patent for STELARA (ustekinumab) will expire in September 2023. STELARA\n(ustekinumab) U.S. sales in fiscal 2022 were approximately $6.4 billion and the expiration of this product patent\nor loss of market exclusivity will result in a reduction in sales.\nInfectious disease products sales were $5.4 billion in 2022, representing a decline of 6.5% as compared to the\nprior year. Operational growth was driven by the COVID-19 vaccine outside the U.S partially offset by lower sales\nof PREZISTA and PREZCOBIX/REZOLSTA (darunavir/cobicistat) due to increased competition and loss of exclusivity of\nPREZISTA in certain countries outside the U.S.\nNeuroscience products sales were $6.9 billion, in 2022, representing a decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior\nyear. The operational sales growth of INVEGA SUSTENNA/XEPLION (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA TRINZA/TREVICTA\nfrom new patient starts and persistence as well as the launch of INVEGA HAFYERA was offset by negative currency\nimpacts and lower sales of RISPERDAL CONSTA.\nOncology products achieved sales of $16.0 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 9.9% as compared to the\nprior year. Contributions to operational growth were strong sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) driven by share gains\nin all regions, continued strong market growth, and uptake of the subcutaneous formulation as well as the continued\nglobal launch uptake of ERLEADA (apalutamide). This was partially offset by declining sales of IMBRUVICA\n(ibrutinib) due to competitive pressures and market suppression and ZYTIGA due to loss of exclusivity in the\nEuropean Union in the second half of 2022.\nPulmonary Hypertension products sales were $3.4 billion, a decline of 1.0% as compared to the prior year. The\noperational sales growth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) and UPTRAVI (selexipag) due to continued share gains and market\ngrowth was offset by COVID-19 related impacts and continued declines in Other Pulmonary Hypertension.\nCardiovascular/Metabolism/Other products sales were $3.9 billion, a decline of 5.6% as compared to the prior year.\nThe operational decline was primarily attributable to lower sales of INVOKANA/INVOKAMET (canagliflozin) due to\nshare erosion and PROCRIT/ EPREX (epoetin alfa) due to biosimilar competition.\nThe Company updated its policy so that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location. The policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B\ncovered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee\ncovered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been\nand will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it\nbelieves its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited\nby the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug\nmanufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities. This policy update\nhad discount implications which positively impacted sales to customers in 2022.\n25\nDuring 2022, the Company advanced its pipeline with several regulatory submissions and approvals for new drugs and\nadditional indications for existing drugs as follows:\nProduct Name                Indication                   US  Approval    EU  Approval    US Filing    EU Filing\n(Chemical Name)\naprocitentan                Treatment for difficult\nto treat hypertension\nCABENUVA (rilpivirine       HIV treatment for\nand cabotegravir)           adolescents\nTreatment for patients\nCARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene    with relapsed or\nautoleucel)                 refractory Multiple\nMyeloma\nERLEADA                     Tablet reduction\n(apalutamide)\nTreatment for Pediatric\nIMBRUVICA  (ibrutinib)      Patients with Chronic\nGraft-Versus-Host Disease\nTreatment for Frontline\nChronic Lymphocytic\nLeukemia (I + V fixed\nduration) (GLOW)\nTreatment of L1 Prostate\ncancer metastatic\nniraparib                   castration-resistant in\ncombination with\nabiraterone acetate and\nPrednisone\nTreatment of Pediatric\nSTELARA (ustekinumab)       Patients with Juvenile\nPsoriatic Arthritis\nTreatment of Patients\nTalquetamab                 with Relapsed Refractory\nMultiple Myeloma\nteclistamab                 Treatment of Patients\n(BCMA/CD3)                  with Relapsed Refractory\nMultiple Myeloma\n26\nMedTech Segment**\nThe MedTech segment sales in 2022 were $27.4 billion, an increase of 1.4% from 2021, which included operational\ngrowth of 6.2% and a negative currency impact of 4.8%.

The operational\ngrowth in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by the following: Endocutter market recovery and new products\npartially offset by competitive pressures in the U.S.; Biosurgery market recovery and the success of new products\npartially offset by strong U.S. market demand in the prior year for infection prevention products; and Energy\nproducts driven by market recovery and new product penetration coupled with competitive supply challenges. The\noperational growth in General Surgery was primarily driven by market recovery and technology penetration.\nThe Orthopaedics franchise sales were $8.6 billion in 2022, which was flat to the prior year. The Orthopaedics\nfranchise included operational sales growth of 3.7% offset by a negative currency impact of 3.7%. The operational\ngrowth in hips reflects the market recovery combined with continued strength of the portfolio including the ACTIS\nstem and enabling technologies – KINCISE and VELYS Hip Navigation. This growth was partially offset by impacts of\nvolume-based procurement in China and the timing of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in knees was\nprimarily driven by procedure recovery, strength of the ATTUNE portfolio and pull through related to the VELYS\nRobotic assisted solution. This growth was partially offset by impacts of volume-based procurement in China and\ntiming of tenders outside the U.S. The operational growth in Trauma was driven by global market recovery and uptake\nof new products. The operational growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by procedure recovery and new\nproduct introductions. This growth was partially offset by competitive pressures in Spine and impacts of volume-\nbased procurement in China.\nThe Vision franchise achieved sales of $4.8 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 3.4% from 2021. The\nContact Lenses/Other operational growth was due to market recovery, price actions, commercial execution and\nbenefits from new products. Surgical Vision operational growth was primarily due to market recovery and the success\nof new products and was partially offset by a higher prior year U.S. Refractory market.\nThe Interventional Solutions franchise achieved sales of $4.3 billion in 2022, representing an increase of 8.3%\nfrom 2021.

These expenditures\nrelate to the processes of discovering, testing and developing new products, upfront payments and developmental\nmilestones, improving existing products, as well as ensuring product efficacy and regulatory compliance prior to\nlaunch. The Company remains committed to investing in research and development with the aim of delivering high\nquality and innovative products.\nResearch and Development decreased as a percent to sales primarily driven by:\nLower milestone payments in the Pharmaceutical business\nIn-Process Research and Development (IPR&D): In the fiscal year 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset\nimpairment charge of approximately $0.8 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab\n(JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa\n(HS). Additional information regarding efficacy of the AD indication and HS indication became available which led\nthe Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for both AD and HS. The Company acquired all\nrights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in the fiscal year 2020. In fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded a\npartial IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion primarily related to expected development delays in the general surgery\ndigital robotics platform (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019. The impairment charge was\ncalculated based on revisions to the discounted cash flow valuation model reflecting a delay of first in human\nprocedures of approximately two years from the initial acquisition model assumption of the second half of 2022. The\nCompany will continue to monitor the remaining $1.5 billion Ottava platform intangible asset as development program\nactivities are ongoing.\nOther (Income) Expense, Net: Other (income) expense, net is the account where the Company records gains and losses\nrelated to the sale and write-down of certain investments in equity securities held by Johnson & Johnson Innovation\n- JJDC, Inc. (JJDC), changes in the fair value of securities, investment (income)/loss related to employee benefit\nprograms, gains and losses on divestitures, certain transactional currency gains and losses, acquisition and\ndivestiture related costs, litigation accruals and settlements, as well as royalty income.\nOther (income) expense, net for the fiscal year 2022 was unfavorable by $1.4 billion as compared to the prior year\nprimarily due to the following:\n(Dollars in Billions)(Income)/Expense          2022    2021    Change\nConsumer Health separation costs            $   1.0     0.1       0.9\nLitigation related(1)                           0.9     2.3      -1.4\nChanges in the fair value of securities         0.7    -0.5       1.2\nOne-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing         0.7     0.0       0.7\nexit related costs\nAcquisition, Integration and Divestiture        0.1    -0.5       0.6\nrelated(2)\nRestructuring related                           0.1     0.1       0.0\nEmployee benefit plan related                  -1.2    -0.6      -0.6\nOther                                          -0.4    -0.4         —\nTotal Other (Income) Expense, Net           $   1.9     0.5       1.4\n( 1) 2022 was primarily related to pelvic mesh and 2021 was primarily related to talc and Risperdal Gynecomastia\n(2) 2022 was primarily costs related to the acquisition of Abiomed. 2021 was p rimarily related to divestiture\ngains of two pharmaceutical brands outside the U.S.\n29\nInterest (Income) Expense: Interest (income) expense in the fiscal of 2022 was net interest income of $214 million\nas compared to interest expense of $130 million in the fiscal year 2021 primarily due to higher rates of interest\nearned on cash balances. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $23.5 billion at the end of 2022,\nand averaged $27.6 billion as compared to the cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities total of $31.6\nbillion and $28.4 billion average cash balance in 2021. The total debt balance at the end of 2022 was $39.7 billion\nwith an average debt balance of $36.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion at the end of 2021 and an average debt\nbalance of $34.5 billion. The lower average cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and higher average\ndebt balance were primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed in late December of 2022.\nIncome Before Tax by Segment\nIncome (loss) before tax by segment of business were as follows:\nPercent of Segment\n(Dollars in             Income Before Tax              Segment Sales                           Sales\nMillions)                            2022      2021             2022      2021                  2022       2021\nConsumer             $              2,930     1,573           14,953    15,035                  19.6  %    10.5\nHealth(3)\nPharmaceutical(3)                  15,901    17,969           52,563    51,680                  30.3       34.8\nMedTech                             4,607     4,373           27,427    27,060                  16.8       16.2\nSegment earnings                   23,438    23,915           94,943    93,775                  24.7       25.5\nbefore tax(1)\nLess: Expenses\nnot allocated to                      624     1,072\nsegments(2)\nLess: Consumer\nHealth separation                   1,089        67\ncosts\nWorldwide income     $             21,725    22,776           94,943    93,775                  22.9  %    24.3\nbefore tax\n(1) See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details.\n(2) Amounts not allocated to segments include interest (income) expense and general corporate (income) expense.\n(3) Prior year income before tax of approximately $0.2 billion has been reclassified as certain international OTC\nproducts, primarily in China, were reclassified from the Pharmaceutical segment to the Consumer Health segment\nbased on operational changes.\nConsumer Health Segment:\nIn 2022, the Consumer Health segment income before tax as a percent of sales was 19.6% versus 10.5% in 2021. The\nincrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:\nLower litigation expense of $0.2 billion in 2022 versus $1.6 billion (primarily talc related) in 2021\nReduction in brand marketing expenses in 2022 versus 2021\nSupply chain benefits in 2022\npartially offset by:\nCommodity inflation in 2022\nPharmaceutical Segment:\nIn 2022, the Pharmaceutical segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 30.3% versus 34.8% in 2021. The\ndecrease in the income before tax as a percent of sales was primarily driven by the following:\nOne-time COVID-19 vaccine manufacturing exit related costs of $1.5 billion in 2022\nUnfavorable changes in the fair value of securities ($0.7 billion loss in 2022 vs. $0.5 billion gain in 2021)\nAn IPR&D charge of $0.8 billion in 2022 related to bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the\ntreatment of Atopic Dermatitis (AD) and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)\nLower divestiture gains of $0.1 billion in 2022 versus $0.6 billion related to two pharmaceutical brands outside\nthe U.S. in fiscal 2021\nCurrency impacts in Cost of Products Sold\npartially offset by:\nLower litigation related expense of $0.1 billion in 2022 versus $0.6 billion (primarily related to Risperdal\nGynecomastia) in 2021\nLower Research & Development milestone payments in 2022\nLower brand marketing expenses in 2022 versus 2021\nIn fiscal 2020 and 2021, the Company entered into a series of contract manufacturing arrangements for vaccine\nproduction with third party contract manufacturing organizations. These arrangements provided the Company with\nsupplemental commercial capacity for vaccine production and potentially transferable rights to such production if\ncapacity is not required. The Company continues to evaluate and monitor both its internal and external supply\narrangements. In fiscal 2022, the COVID-19 Vaccine related costs (mentioned above) included the remaining\ncommitments and obligations, including external manufacturing network exit and related inventory costs and required\nclinical trial expenses, associated with the Company's modification of its\n30\nCOVID-19 vaccine research program and manufacturing capacity to levels that meet all remaining customer contractual\nrequirements.\nMedTech Segment:\nIn 2022, the MedTech segment income before tax as a percent to sales was 16.8% versus 16.2% in 2021. The increase\nin the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:\nAn IPR&D charge of $0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava)\nacquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019\npartially offset by:\nHigher litigation related expense of $0.6 billion in 2022, primarily related to pelvic mesh costs versus $0.1\nbillion in 2021\nAcquisition related costs of $0.3 billion in 2022 related to the Abiomed acquisition versus $0.1 billion in 2021\nRestructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its\nGlobal Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical\ncapabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future,\nenhance agility and drive growth. The Global Supply Chain actions included expanding its use of strategic\ncollaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing\ncapabilities and optimizing its supply chain network. The Company has achieved approximately $0.8 billion in annual\npre-tax cost savings as outlined in the restructuring actions. In 2022, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of\n$0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in\nrestructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project\ncosts of approximately $2.2 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was\ncompleted in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022.\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 17.4% in 2022 and 8.3% in 2021.\nIn the fiscal 2022, the Company incurred approximately $0.5 billion net incremental international tax cost related\nto the legal separation of the Consumer Health business, and may continue to incur additional cost in fiscal 2023.\nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which\ngenerally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. The EU\neffective dates are January 1, 2024, and January 1, 2025, for different aspects of the directive.\nA significant number of other countries are expected to also implement similar legislation, including South Korea\nwhich approved legislation on December 23, 2022 with a full effective date of January 1, 2024. The Company is\ncontinuing to evaluate the potential impact on future periods of the Pillar Two Framework, pending legislative\nadoption by additional individual countries, including those within the European Union.\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2022 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity & Cash Flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.1 billion at the end of 2022 as compared to $14.5 billion at the end of 2021.\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.4 billion decrease were:\n(Dollars In Billions)\n$                   14.5    Q4 2021 Cash and cash equivalents balance\n21.2    cash generated from operating activities\n-12.4    net cash used by investing activities\n-8.9    net cash used by financing activities\n$                   -0.3    effect of exchange rate and rounding\n$                   14.1    Q4 2022 Cash and cash equivalents balance\nIn addition, the Company had $9.4 billion in marketable securities at the end of fiscal year 2022 and $17.1 billion\nat the end of fiscal year 2021.

As of January 1, 2023, the net debt position was $16.1 billion as compared to the prior year\nof $2.1 billion. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. in December 2022. The debt\nbalance at the end of 2022 was $39.7 billion as compared to $33.8 billion in 2021. Considering recent market\nconditions, the Company has re-evaluated its operating cash flows and liquidity profile and does not foresee any\nsignificant incremental risk. The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the ability to raise funds from\nexternal sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and access to the commercial paper\nmarkets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs, including the Company's remaining\nbalance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately $2.7 billion and the\nestablishment of the $2.0 billion trust for talc related liabilities (See Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements for additional details). In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing\nbasis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable. Effective beginning in fiscal\n2022, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Job Act of 2017 (TCJA) requires the Company to deduct U.S. and international research\nand development expenditures for tax purposes over 5 to 15 years, instead of in the current fiscal year. As a\nresult, in fiscal 2022, the Company experienced an increase in annual cash tax payments of approximately $1.2\nbillion above what otherwise would have been remitted to the U.S Treasury. The Company concurrently records a\ndeferred tax benefit for the future amortization of the research and development (R&D) for tax purposes. The\nrequirement to expense R&D as incurred is unchanged for U.S. GAAP purposes and the impact to pre-tax R&D expense is\nnot affected by this provision.\nOn September 14, 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program,\nauthorizing the Company to purchase up to $5.0 billion of the Company's Common Stock. Share repurchases may be made\nat management’s discretion from time to time on the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. The\nrepurchase program has no time limit and may be suspended for periods or discontinued at any time. Any shares\nacquired will be available\n32\nfor general corporate purposes. The Company intends to finance the share repurchase program through available cash.\nThrough January 1, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion has been repurchased under the program.\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s material contractual obligations and their aggregate maturities as of\nJanuary 1, 2023: To satisfy these obligations, the Company intends to use cash from operations.\nTax Legislation                             Interest on\n(Dollars in Millions)                (TCJA)    Debt Obligations    Debt Obligations     Total\n2023                     $            1,522               1,551                 893     3,966\n2024                                  2,029               1,392                 843     4,264\n2025                                  2,536               1,667                 789     4,992\n2026                                      —               1,996                 744     2,740\n2027                                      —               2,271                 736     3,007\nAfter 2026                                —              19,562               8,772    28,334\nTotal                    $            6,087              28,439              12,777    47,303\nFor tax matters, see Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFinancing and Market Risk\nThe Company uses financial instruments to manage the impact of foreign exchange rate changes on cash flows.\nAccordingly, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of certain foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities and to hedge future foreign currency transactions primarily related to product\ncosts. Gains or losses on these contracts are offset by the gains or losses on the underlying transactions. A 10%\nappreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1, 2023 market rates would increase the unrealized value of the\nCompany’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. Conversely, a 10% depreciation of the U.S. Dollar from the January 1,\n2023 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of the Company’s forward contracts by $0.1 billion. In either\nscenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying\ntransaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated earnings and cash flows.\nThe Company hedges the exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, and the effect on certain assets and\nliabilities in foreign currency, by entering into currency swap contracts. A 1% change in the spread between U.S.\nand foreign interest rates on the Company’s interest rate sensitive financial instruments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of the Company’s swap contracts by approximately $1.7 billion. In either scenario, at\nmaturity, the gain or loss on the swap contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction,\nand therefore, would have no impact on future anticipated cash flows.\nThe Company does not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Further, the Company has\na policy of only entering into contracts with parties that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The\ncounterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions and there is no significant concentration of\nexposure with any one counterparty. Management believes the risk of loss is remote. The Company entered into credit\nsupport agreements (CSA) with certain derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on\nrespective credit ratings and netting agreements. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details on credit support agreements.\nThe Company invests in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities which carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to a rise in\ninterest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted if interest rates fall. A 1%\n(100 basis points) change in spread on the Company’s interest rate sensitive investments would either increase or\ndecrease the unrealized value of cash equivalents and current marketable securities by less than $0.1 billion.\nThe Company has access to substantial sources of funds at numerous banks worldwide. In September 2022, the Company\nsecured a new 364-day Credit Facility of $10 billion, which expires on September 7, 2023. In November 2022, the\nCompany secured an additional 364-day revolving Credit Facility of $10 billion, which has an expiration of November\n21, 2023. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line agreement is based on either Secured Overnight\nFinancing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate as allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment\nfees under the agreement are not material.\nTotal borrowings at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $39.7 billion and $33.8 billion, respectively. The increase in\nborrowings was due to the acquisition of Abiomed, Inc. In 2022, net debt (cash and current marketable securities,\nnet of debt) was $16.1 billion compared to net debt of $2.1 billion in 2021. Total debt represented 34.1% of total\ncapital (shareholders’ equity and total debt) in 2022 and 31.3% of total capital in 2021. Shareholders’ equity per\nshare at the end of 2022 was $29.39 compared to $28.16 at year-end 2021.\nA summary of borrowings can be found in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n33\nDividends\nThe Company increased its dividend in 2022 for the 60th consecutive year. Cash dividends paid were $4.45 per share\nin 2022 and $4.19 per share in 2021.\nOn January 3, 2023, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.13 per share, payable on March 7,\n2023 to shareholders of record as of February 21, 2023.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based on the Company’s\nconsolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the U.S. (GAAP). The preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the amounts reported for revenues, expenses, assets, liabilities and other related\ndisclosures. Actual results may or may not differ from these estimates. The Company believes that the understanding\nof certain key accounting policies and estimates are essential in achieving more insight into the Company’s\noperating results and financial condition. These key accounting policies include revenue recognition, income taxes,\nlegal and self-insurance contingencies, valuation of long-lived assets, assumptions used to determine the amounts\nrecorded for pensions and other employee benefit plans and accounting for stock based awards.\nRevenue Recognition: The Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a\ncontract with the customer are satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to\ncustomers. The Company's global payment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates,\nsales incentives, trade promotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback\nprovisions are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. The Company evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily\nthrough the analysis of wholesaler and other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as\ninternally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during the\nfiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements of certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than\n2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and\n2020 and are included in sales to customers.\nIn addition, the Company enters into collaboration arrangements that contain multiple revenue generating\nactivities. Amounts due from collaborative partners for these arrangements are recognized as each activity is\nperformed or delivered, based on the relative selling price. Upfront fees received as part of these arrangements\nare deferred and recognized over the performance period. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional disclosures on collaborations.\nReasonably likely changes to assumptions used to calculate the accruals for rebates, returns and promotions are not\nanticipated to have a material effect on the financial statements. The Company currently discloses the impact of\nchanges to assumptions in the quarterly or annual filing in which there is a material financial statement impact.\n34\nBelow are tables that show the

Income taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the\nresults of any difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or\nliabilities. The Company estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates.\nFuture changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP, which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $0.5 billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 1 and Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nLegal and Self Insurance Contingencies: The Company records accruals for various contingencies, including legal\nproceedings and product liability claims as these arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on\nmanagement’s judgment as to the probability of losses and, where applicable, actuarially determined estimates. The\nCompany has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self\ninsurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can\nbe reasonably estimated.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nSee Notes 1 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding product liability and\nlegal proceedings.\n36\nLong-Lived and Intangible Assets: The Company assesses changes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, in economic\nconditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows in evaluating the value of the Company’s\nproperty, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. As these assumptions and estimates may change over\ntime, it may or may not be necessary for the Company to record impairment charges.\nEmployee Benefit Plans: The Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit,\ndefined contribution and termination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. These plans are based\non assumptions for the discount rate, expected return on plan assets, mortality rates, expected salary increases,\nhealthcare cost trend rates and attrition rates. See Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further\ndetails on these rates.\nStock Based Compensation: The Company recognizes compensation expense associated with the issuance of equity\ninstruments to employees for their services. Based on the type of equity instrument, the fair value is estimated on\nthe date of grant using either the Black-Scholes option valuation model or a combination of both the Black-Scholes\noption valuation model and Monte Carlo valuation model, and is expensed in the financial statements over the\nservice period. The input assumptions used in determining fair value are the expected life, expected volatility,\nrisk-free rate and expected dividend yield. For performance share units, the fair market value is calculated for\nthe two component goals at the date of grant: adjusted operational earnings per share and relative total\nshareholder return. The fair values for the earnings per share goal of each performance share unit was estimated on\nthe date of grant using the fair market value of the shares at the time of the award, discounted for dividends,\nwhich are not paid on the performance share units during the vesting period. The fair value for the relative total\nshareholder return goal of each performance share unit was estimated on the date of grant using the Monte Carlo\nvaluation model. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for recently adopted accounting pronouncements and\nrecently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted as of January 1, 2023.\n37\nEconomic and Market Factors\nThe Company is aware that its products are used in an environment where, for more than a decade, policymakers,\nconsumers and businesses have expressed concerns about the rising cost of healthcare. In response to these\nconcerns, the Company has a long-standing policy of pricing products responsibly. For the period 2012 - 2022, in\nthe U.S., the weighted average compound annual growth rate of the Company’s net price increases for healthcare\nproducts (prescription and over-the-counter drugs, hospital and professional products) was below the U.S. Consumer\nPrice Index (CPI).\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates continue to have an\neffect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way companies operate. The Company has accounted for\noperations in Argentina and Venezuela as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate\nsurpassed 100%. Beginning in the fiscal second quarter of 2022, the Company accounted for operations in Turkey as\nhighly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. This did not have a material\nimpact to the Company's results in the period. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its\nprofit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nRussia-Ukraine War\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal 2022, including accounts receivable or inventory reserves, was not\nmaterial. As of both the fiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s\nUkraine subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and revenues. As of both the\nfiscal years ending January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries\nrepresented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated assets and represented 1% of revenues.\nIn early March, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. Additionally, at the end of March, the Company made the decision to suspend supply\nof personal care products in Russia. The Company continues to supply its other products as patients rely on many of\nthe products for healthcare purposes.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. A 1% change in the value of the U.S. Dollar as\ncompared to all foreign currencies in which the Company had sales, income or expense in 2022 would have increased\nor decreased the translation of foreign sales by approximately $0.5 billion and net income by approximately $0.1\nbillion.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide healthcare changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude healthcare cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions, pricing and\nreimbursement of healthcare products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company also operates in an environment increasingly hostile to intellectual property rights. Firms have filed\nAbbreviated New Drug Applications or Biosimilar Biological Product Applications with the U.S. FDA or otherwise\nchallenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company's patents, seeking to market generic or biosimilar forms of\nmany of the Company’s key pharmaceutical products prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those\nproducts. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting\nlawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue will be introduced to the market, resulting in\nthe potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-\ncash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also a risk that one or more competitors could\nlaunch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or\nmore valid patents are in place.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability, intellectual property, commercial, employment, indemnification and other matters; governmental\ninvestigations; and other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based\n38\non new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and\nregulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to\nestimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies\noften result from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on\nestimates and assumptions including timing of related payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments\ncan be affected by various factors including, among other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are\nunsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings\nare in early stages; matters present legal uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or\njurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve\ncomprehensive multi-party settlements; complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are\nnumerous parties involved. To the extent adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the\nCompany, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably\nestimated.\nIn the Company's opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company's balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company's results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nSee Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report for further information\nregarding legal proceedings.\nCommon Stock\nThe Company’s Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol JNJ. As of February 10, 2023,\nthere were 124,211 record holders of Common Stock of the Company.",

Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the Company).\nIntercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. Columns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding.\nPercentages have been calculated using actual, non-rounded figures.\nDescription of the Company and Business Segments\nThe Company has approximately 152,700employees worldwide engaged in the research and development, manufacture and\nsale of a broad range of products in the healthcare field. The Company conducts business in virtually all countries\nof the world and its primary focus is on products related to human health and well-being.\nThe Company is organized into threebusiness segments: Consumer Health, Pharmaceutical and MedTech. The Consumer\nHealth segment includes a broad range of products used in the Baby Care, Oral Care, Skin Health/Beauty, Over-the-\nCounter pharmaceutical, Women’s Health and Wound Care markets. These products are marketed to the general public\nand sold online (eCommerce) and to retail outlets and distributors throughout the world. The Pharmaceutical segment\nis focused on the following therapeutic areas, including Immunology, Infectious diseases, Neuroscience, Oncology,\nPulmonary Hypertension, and Cardiovascular and Metabolic diseases. Products in this segment are distributed\ndirectly to retailers, wholesalers, distributors, hospitals and healthcare professionals for prescription use. The\nMedTech segment includes a broad portfolio of products used in the Orthopaedic, Surgery, Interventional Solutions\n(cardiovascular and neurovascular) and Vision fields. These products are distributed to wholesalers, hospitals and\nretailers, and used principally in the professional fields by physicians, nurses, hospitals, eye care professionals\nand clinics.\nIn November 2021, the Company announced its intention to separate the Company’s Consumer Health business (Kenvue as\nthe name for the planned New Consumer Health Company), with the intention to create a new, publicly traded company\nby the end of the fiscal year 2023.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in fiscal 2022.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nNot Adopted as of January 1, 2023\nASU 2022-04: Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50) – Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program\nObligations\nThis update requires that a buyer in a supplier finance program disclose additional information about the program\nto allow financial statement users to better understand the effect of the programs on an entity’s working capital,\nliquidity, and cash flows. This update will be effective for the Company for fiscal years beginning after December\n15, 2022, except for the amendment on roll forward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2023. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently assessing the impact of this update on its\ndisclosures and will adopt this standard in the fiscal first quarter of 2023.\nCash Equivalents\nThe Company classifies all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of\npurchase as cash equivalents and all highly liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months\nfrom the date of purchase as current marketable securities. The Company has a policy of making investments only\nwith commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating. The Company invests its cash\nprimarily in government securities and obligations, corporate debt securities, money market funds and reverse\nrepurchase agreements (RRAs).\nRRAs are collateralized by deposits in the form of Government Securities and Obligations for an amount not less\nthan 102% of their value. The Company does not record an asset or liability as the Company is not permitted to sell\nor repledge the associated collateral. The Company has a policy that the collateral has at least an A (or\nequivalent) credit rating. The Company utilizes a third party custodian to manage the exchange of funds and ensure\nthat collateral received is maintained at 102% of the value of the RRAs on a daily basis. RRAs with stated\nmaturities of greater than three months from the date of purchase are classified as marketable securities.\nInvestments\nInvestments classified as held to maturity investments are reported at amortized cost and realized gains or losses\nare reported in earnings. Investments classified as available-for-sale debt securities are carried at estimated\nfair value with unrealized gains and\n46\nlosses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities available\nfor current operations are classified as current assets otherwise, they are classified as long term. Management\ndetermines the appropriate classification of its investment in debt and equity securities at the time of purchase\nand re-evaluates such determination at each balance sheet date. The Company reviews its investments for impairment\nand adjusts these investments to fair value through earnings, as required.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment and Depreciation\nBuilding and building equipment    30years\nLand and leasehold improvements    10-20years\nMachinery and equipment            2-13years\nThe Company capitalizes certain computer software and development costs, included in machinery and equipment, when\nincurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use. Capitalized software costs\nare amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software, which generally range from 3to 8years.\nThe Company reviews long-lived assets to assess recoverability using undiscounted cash flows. When certain events\nor changes in operating or economic conditions occur, an impairment assessment may be performed on the\nrecoverability of the carrying value of these assets. If the asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is\nmeasured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. If quoted market prices are\nnot available, the Company will estimate fair value using a discounted value of estimated future cash flows.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue from product sales when obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer\nare satisfied; generally, this occurs with the transfer of control of the goods to customers. The Company's global\npayment terms are typically between 30 to 90 days. Provisions for certain rebates, sales incentives, trade\npromotions, coupons, product returns, discounts to customers and governmental clawback provisions are accounted for\nas variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability is recognized within Accrued Rebates,\nReturns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance sheet.\nProduct discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct, indirect and other market\nparticipants, as well as market conditions, including consideration of competitor pricing. Rebates are estimated\nbased on contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis and projected market conditions\nin the various markets served. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of the\nCompany's pharmaceutical products within the U.S., primarily t he Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs,\nwhich amounted to $ 9.6billion and $ 7.7billion as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, respectively. The\nCompany evaluates market conditions for products or groups of products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler\nand other third-party sell-through and market research data, as well as internally generated information.\nSales returns are estimated and recorded based on historical sales and returns information. Products that exhibit\nunusual sales or return patterns due to dating, competition or other marketing matters are specifically\ninvestigated and analyzed as part of the accounting for sales return accruals.\nSales returns allowances represent a reserve for products that may be returned due to expiration, destruction in\nthe field, or in specific areas, product recall. The sales returns reserve is based on historical return trends by\nproduct and by market as a percent to gross sales. In accordance with the Company’s accounting policies, the\nCompany generally issues credit to customers for returned goods. The Company’s sales returns reserves are accounted\nfor in accordance with the U.S. GAAP guidance for revenue recognition when right of return exists. Sales returns\nreserves are recorded at full sales value. Sales returns in the Consumer Health and Pharmaceutical segments are\nalmost exclusively not resalable. Sales returns for certain franchises in the MedTech segment are typically\nresalable but are not material. The Company infrequently exchanges products from inventory for returned products.\nThe sales returns reserve for the total Company has been approximately 1.0% of annual net trade sales during each\nof the fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020.\nPromotional programs, such as product listing allowances and cooperative advertising arrangements, are recorded in\nthe same period as related sales. Continuing promotional programs include coupons and volume-based sales incentive\nprograms. The redemption cost of consumer coupons is based on historical redemption experience by product and\nvalue. Volume-based incentive programs are based on the estimated sales volumes for the incentive period and are\nrecorded as products are sold. These arrangements are evaluated to determine the appropriate amounts to be deferred\nor recorded as a reduction of revenue. The Company also earns profit-share payments through collaborative\narrangements for certain products, which are included in sales to customers. Profit-share payments were less than\n2.0% of the total revenues in fiscal year 2022 and less than 3.0% of the total revenues in fiscal years 2021 and\n2020 and are included in sales to customers.\n47\nSee Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disaggregation of revenue.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs incurred were $ 1.1billion, $ 1.1billion and $ 1.0billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021\nand 2020, respectively, and are included in selling, marketing and administrative expense. The amount of revenue\nreceived for shipping and handling is less than 1.0% of sales to customers for all periods presented.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value determined by the first-in, first-out method.\nIntangible Assets and Goodwill\nThe authoritative literature on U.S. GAAP requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives be\nassessed annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual impairment test for 2022 in the fiscal fourth\nquarter. Future impairment tests will be performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter, or sooner if warranted.\nPurchased in-process research and development is accounted for as an indefinite lived intangible asset until the\nunderlying project is completed, at which point the intangible asset will be accounted for as a definite lived\nintangible asset. If warranted the purchased in-process research and development could be written off or partially\nimpaired depending on the underlying program.\nIntangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives, and are reviewed\nfor impairment when warranted by economic conditions. See Note 5 for further details on Intangible Assets and\nGoodwill.\nFinancial Instruments\nAs required by U.S. GAAP, all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is\nthe exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is a market-\nbased measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue, with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3 having the lowest. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe Company documents all relationships between hedged items and derivatives. The overall risk management strategy\nincludes reasons for undertaking hedge transactions and entering into derivatives. The objectives of this strategy\nare: (1) minimize foreign currency exposure’s impact on the Company’s financial performance; (2) protect the\nCompany’s cash flow from adverse movements in foreign exchange rates; (3) ensure the appropriateness of financial\ninstruments; and (4) manage the enterprise risk associated with financial institutions. See Note 6 for additional\ninformation on Financial Instruments.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether an arrangement is a lease at contract inception by establishing if the contract\nconveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange\nfor consideration. Right of Use (ROU) Assets and Lease Liabilities for operating leases are included in Other\nassets, Accrued liabilities, and Other liabilitieson the consolidated balance sheet. The ROU Assets represent the\nright to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease\npayments arising from the lease. Commitments under finance leases are not significant, and are included in\nProperty, plant and equipment, Loans and notes payable, and Long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet.\nROU Assets and Lease Liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of all\nminimum lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments, when the implicit\nrate is not readily determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease. These options\nare included in the lease term when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating\nlease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has elected the following\npolicy elections on adoption: use of portfolio approach on leases of assets under master service agreements,\nexclusion of short term leases on the balance sheet, and not separating lease and non-lease components.\nThe Company primarily has operating lease for space, vehicles, manufacturing equipment and data processing\nequipment. The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $ 1.1billion and $ 0.9billion in fiscal years 2022 and\n2021, respectively. The lease liability was $ 1.3billion and $ 1.0billion in fiscal years 2022 and 2021,\nrespectively. The operating lease costs were $ 0.3billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash\npaid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $ 0.3billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and\n2020, respectively.\nProduct Liability\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability\nhas been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and\nactuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information\nbecomes available. The Company\n48\naccrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can\nbe reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does\nnot record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the\nself insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts\ncan be reasonably estimated.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development.\nUpfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are\nexpensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to\nregulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts\ncapitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies,\nto develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or\nmore) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards\ndependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by\none or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these\ncollaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of\ncertain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners\nrelated to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense\nbecause the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company’s operations. In general,\nthe income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\nNature/Type of Collaboration              Statement of Earnings Presentation\nThird-party sale of product & profit      Sales to customers\nshare payments received\nRoyalties/milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (post-regulatory    Cost of products sold\napproval)*\nRoyalties received from collaborative     Other income (expense), net\npartner\nUpfront payments & milestones paid to\ncollaborative partner (pre-regulatory     Research and development expense\napproval)\nResearch and development payments to      Research and development expense\ncollaborative partner\nResearch and development payments\nreceived from collaborative partner or    Reduction of Research and development expense\ngovernment entity\n*    Milestones are capitalized as intangible assets and amortized to cost of products sold over the useful\nlife.\nFor all years presented, there was no individual project that represented greater than 5% of the total annual\nconsolidated research and development expense.\nThe Company has a number of products and compounds developed in collaboration with strategic partners including\nXARELTO, co-developed with Bayer HealthCare AG and IMBRUVICA, developed in collaboration and co-marketed with\nPharmacyclics LLC, an AbbVie company.\nSeparately, the Company has a number of licensing arrangements for products and compounds including DARZALEX,\nlicensed from Genmab A/S.\nAdvertising\nCosts associated with advertising are expensed in the year incurred and are included in selling, marketing and\nadministrative expenses. Advertising expenses worldwide, which comprised television, radio, print media and\nInternet advertising, were $ 2.1billion, $ 2.7billion and $ 2.1billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020,\nrespectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable for the current year and include the results of\nany difference between U.S. GAAP accounting and tax reporting, recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities. The\nCompany estimates deferred tax assets and liabilities based on enacted tax regulations and rates. Future changes in\ntax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future.\nThe Company has unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company follows U.S. GAAP which\nprescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and\nmeasurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Management believes that changes in\nthese estimates would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations, cash flows or financial\nposition.\nIn 2017, the United States enacted into law new U.S. tax legislation, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). This\nlaw included provisions for a comprehensive overhaul of the corporate income tax code, including a reduction of the\nstatutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective on January 1, 2018. The TCJA included a provision for a tax\non all previously\n49\nundistributed earnings of U.S. companies located in foreign jurisdictions. Undistributed earnings in the form of\ncash and cash equivalents were taxed at a rate of 15.5% and all other earnings were taxed at a rate of 8.0%. This\ntax is payable over 8 years and will not accrue interest. These payments began in 2018 and will continue through\n2025. The remaining balance at the end of the 2022 was approximately $ 6.1billion, of which $ 4.6billion is\nclassified as noncurrent and reflected as “Long-term taxes payable” on the Company’s balance sheet. The balance of\nthis account is related to receivables from tax authorities not expected to be received in the next 12 months.\nThe TCJA also includes provisions for a tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI). GILTI is described as\nthe excess of a U.S. shareholder’s total net foreign income over a deemed return on tangible assets, as provided by\nthe TCJA. In January 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows companies to elect as an accounting policy whether\nto record the tax effects of GILTI in the period the tax liability is generated (i.e., “period cost”) or provide\nfor deferred tax assets and liabilities related to basis differences that exist and are expected to effect the\namount of GILTI inclusion in future years upon reversal (i.e., “deferred method”). The Company has elected to\naccount for GILTI under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts recorded are based on the evaluation of\ntemporary differences that are expected to reverse as GILTI is incurred in future periods.\nThe Company has recorded deferred tax liabilities on all undistributed earnings prior to December 31, 2017 from its\ninternational subsidiaries. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on the undistributed earnings subsequent to\nJanuary 1, 2018 from certain international subsidiaries where the earnings are considered to be indefinitely\nreinvested. The Company intends to continue to reinvest these earnings in those international operations. If the\nCompany decides at a later date to repatriate these earnings to the U.S., the Company would be required to provide\nfor the net tax effects on these amounts. The Company estimates that the tax effect of this repatriation would be\napproximately $ 0.5billion under currently enacted tax laws and regulations and at current currency exchange rates.\nThis amount does not include the possible benefit of U.S. foreign tax credits, which may substantially offset this\ncost.\nSee Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information regarding income taxes.\nNet Earnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net earnings available to common shareholders by the weighted\naverage number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential\ndilution that could occur if securities were exercised or converted into common stock using the treasury stock\nmethod.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe U.S. requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Estimates are used\nwhen accounting for sales discounts, rebates, allowances and incentives, product liabilities, income taxes,\nwithholding taxes, depreciation, amortization, employee benefits, contingencies and intangible asset and liability\nvaluations. Actual results may or may not differ from those estimates.\nThe Company follows the provisions of U.S. GAAP when recording litigation related contingencies. A liability is\nrecorded when a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated. The best estimate of a loss within a range is\naccrued; however, if no estimate in the range is better than any other, the minimum amount is accrued.\nAnnual Closing Date\nThe Company follows the concept of a fiscal year, which ends on the Sunday nearest to the end of the month of\nDecember. Normally each fiscal year consists of 52 weeks, but every five or six years the fiscal year consists of\n53 weeks, and therefore includes additional shipping days, as was the case in fiscal year 2020, and will be the\ncase again in fiscal year 2026.\nReclassification\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n50\n2.

The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company primarily uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related\nto fixed rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency\ninterest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the\nCompany uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and\nliabilities. These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges and therefore, changes in the\nfair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the\nrelated foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nIn the fiscal fourth quarter of 2022, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps with notional\namounts totaling $ 2.4billion in contemplation of hedging interest rate risk associated with long-term financing\nfor the Consumer Health segment separation. These forward starting interest rate swaps are not designated as hedges\nand therefore, changes in the fair values of these derivatives are recognized in earnings. At the end of the fiscal\nyear 2022, the changes in fair value was not material and therefore not included in the table below.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of January 1, 2023, the total amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA amounted\nto $ 0.8billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company monitors\ncounter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the Company\nprimarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit rating.\nRefer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of January 1, 2023, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 43.3billion, $ 36.2billion and $ 12.4billion, respectively. As of January 2, 2022, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps\nand interest rate swaps of $ 45.8billion, $ 37.4billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings, and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted through the currency translation account within accumulated other comprehensive\nincome. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense using the\nspot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly effective in\noffsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly effective, hedge\naccounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes issued in May 2016 with due dates ranging from 2022 to 2035 as a\nnet investment hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as\ntheir functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of January 1, 2023, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 230million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 13. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 monthsas a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedges. The amount ultimately realized in earnings\nmay differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual exchange\nrates at maturity of the derivative.\n54\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to derivatives and hedges for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, net of tax:\nJanua…                                             Janua…\n1,                                                 2,\n2023                                               2022\n(Dol…                   Cost              Inter…      Other              Cost of              Intere…     Other\nin           Sales        of       R&D    (Inco…    (Incom…     Sales    Produc…       R&D    (Incom…    (Inco…\nMill…                 Produ…    Expen…    Expen…    Expense                 Sold    Expen…    Expense    Expen…\nSold\nThe\neffe…\nof\nfair\nvalu…\nnet\ninve…\nand\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nfair\nvalue\nhedg…\nrela…\nInte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nHedg…    $       —         —         —    -1,098          —         —          —         —       -109         —\nitems\nDeri…\ndesi…\nas               —         —         —     1,098          —         —          —         —        109         —\nhedg…\ninst…\nGain\n(Los…\non\nnet\ninve…\nhedg…\nrela…\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…\nreco…\nin\ninco…    $       —         —         —       140          —         —          —         —        174         —\non\nderi…\namou…\nexcl…\nfrom\neffe…\ntest…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor               —         —         —       140          —         —          —         —        174         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nGain\n(Los…\non\ncash\nflow\nhedg…\nrela…\nForw…\nfore…\nexch…\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…          -72      -271       149         —        -23        17        119        30          —        47\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor               5       319        61         —       -113       -94       -557       123          —       146\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nCross\ncurr…\ninte…\nrate\nswaps\ncont…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor\n(los…            —         —         —       425          —         —          —         —        402         —\nrecl…\nfrom\nAOCI\ninto\ninco…\nAmou…\nof\ngain\nor       $       —         —         —        42          —         —          —         —          9         —\n(los…\nreco…\nin\nAOCI\nAs of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, the following amounts were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet\nrelated to cumulative basis adjustment for fair value hedges\nLine item\nin the                                                             Cumulative\nConsolid…                                                           Amount of\nBalance                                                            Fair Value\nSheet in                                                              Hedging\nwhich the                                                          Adjustment\nhedged                                                               Included\nitem is          Carrying                                              in the\nincluded        Amount of                                            Carrying\n(Dollars              the                                           Amount of\nin                 Hedged  January 1,              January         the Hedged  January               January 2,\nMillions)       Liability  2023                    2, 2022          Liability  1, 2023               2022\nLong-term    $      8,665                $  9,793               $      -1,435               $  -142\nDebt\n55\nGain/(Loss)\n(Dollars in Millions)             Location of Gain /(Loss)                     Recognized In\nDerivatives Not Designated as     Recognized in Income                  Income on Derivative\nHedging Instruments               on Derivative                              January 1, 2023    January 2, 2022\nForeign Exchange Contracts        Other (income) expense             $                    94                -70\nLocation of\nGain or (Loss)\nReclassified\nfrom               Gain/(Loss)\nAccumulated        Reclassified\nGain/(Loss)                       Other              From\nRecognized In                       Comprehensive      Accumulated OCI\n(Dollars in          Accumulated OCI                       Income Into        Into Income        January 2,\nMillions)            January 1, 2023    January 2, 2022    Income             January 1, 2023    2022\nInterest\nDebt              $              197                387    (income)           —                  —\nexpense\nCross Currency                                             Interest\ninterest rate     $              766                548    (income)           —                  —\nswaps                                                      expense\nThe Company holds equity investments with readily determinable fair values and equity investments without readily\ndeterminable fair values.

There were offsetting impacts of $ 142million and $ 422million, respectively, of changes\nin the fair value reflected in net income due to changes in observable prices and gains on the disposal of\ninvestments. The impact in fiscal year 2021, was driven by the gain on disposal of the Grail investment. In fiscal\nyear 2022, the Company sold all of its equity investments in argenx SE for proceeds of $ 0.6billion.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 having the highest priority and Level 3\nhaving the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\n57\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022 were as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)\nDerivatives designated as hedging instruments:          2022                                        2021\nAssets:                                              Level 1    Level 2    Level 3     Total    Total(1)\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —        629          —       629         540\nInterest rate contracts(2)                                 —      1,534          —     1,534         796\nTotal                                             $        —      2,163          —     2,163       1,336\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —        511          —       511         881\nInterest rate contracts(2)                                 —      2,778          —     2,778         979\nTotal                                             $        —      3,289          —     3,289       1,860\nDerivatives not designated as hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                $        —         38          —        38          24\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange contracts                         —         68          —        68          28\nAvailable For Sale Other Investments:\nEquity investments(3)                                    576          —          —       576       1,884\nDebt securities(4)                                         —     10,487          —    10,487      19,727\nOther Liabilities\nContingent Consideration(5)                                $                 1,120     1,120         533\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation\n(Dollars in Millions)                          2022      2021\nTotal Gross Assets                        $   2,201     1,360\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -2,176    -1,285\nTotal Net Asset                                  25        75\nTotal Gross Liabilities                       3,357     1,888\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)               -3,023    -1,855\nTotal Net Liabilities                     $     334        33\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\n(Dollars in Millions)                     2022    2021      2020\nBeginning Balance                     $    533     633     1,715\nChanges in estimated fair value(6)        -194     -52    -1,089\nAdditions(7)                               792       —       106\nPayments                                   -11     -48       -99\nEnding Balance                        $  1,120     533       633\n(1) 2021 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n1,884million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 533million, classified as Level 3.\n(2) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n58\n(3) Classified as non-current other assets.\n(4) Classified as cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(5) Includes $ 1,116million, $ 520million and $ 594million, classified as non-current other liabilities as of\nJanuary 1, 2023, January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively.

The 2022 amount includes the impact of certain provisions of the 2017 TCJA\nthat became effective in fiscal 2022. The 2021 amounts include the reorganization of international subsidiaries;\nthe 2020 amounts include the impact of the new tax legislation enactment in Switzerland, both of which are further\ndescribed below.\n(3) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nThe fiscal year 2022 effective tax rate increased 9.1% as compared to the fiscal year 2021 effective tax rate. As\npart of the planned separation of the Company’s Consumer Health business, the Company has recognized approximately\n$ 0.5billion in net incremental tax costs in fiscal year 2022, which increased the 2022 effective tax rate by\napproximately 2.2%.\nAdditionally, the Company recorded certain non-recurring favorable tax items in fiscal year 2021 which resulted in\nan unfavorable impact to the Company’s fiscal 2022 effective tax rate when compared to the prior fiscal year. These\nitems are described below. The Company’s 2022 tax rate also benefited from certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act of 2017 that became effective in fiscal 2022, the impairment of bermekimab for AD and HS IPR&D (for\nfurther information see Note 5 of the 2022 10-K Consolidated Financial Statements) and changes in the fair value of\nsecurities in the Company’s investment portfolio, both recorded at the U.S. statutory rate.\nThe fiscal year 2021 tax rate decreased by 2.5% compared to the fiscal year 2020 tax rate, which was primarily\ndriven by the following items. In fiscal year 2021, the Company reorganized the ownership structure of certain\nwholly-owned international subsidiaries. As part of this reorganization, the Company increased the tax basis of\ncertain assets to fair value in accordance with applicable local regulations. The net impact of this restructuring\nwas approximately $ 0.6billion net benefit or 2.7% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 2.3billion of local deferred tax assets to record the remeasurement of the tax basis of these\nassets to fair value, this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax\nrate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 1.7billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of these deferred tax assets. This expense has been reflected as “U.S. tax on international\nincome” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nAlso, in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2021 tax rate by approximately 1.3% which\nis reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. Additionally\nother fiscal 2021 impacts to the rate were primarily driven by litigation and acquisition related items as follows:\n62\nthe Company accrued additional legal expenses, of approximately $ 1.6billion for talc at an effective tax rate of\n23.5% and $ 0.8billion for Risperdal Gynecomastia settlements at an effective tax rate of 16.4% (See Note 19 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements for more details).\nthe Company recorded a partial IPR&D charge of $ 0.9billion for the Ottava intangible asset (acquired with the\nAuris Health acquisition in 2019) at an effective rate of 22.4%.\nIn fiscal year 2019, Switzerland enacted the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) and became\neffective for fiscal year 2020. The Federal transitional provisions of TRAF allow companies, under certain\nconditions, to adjust the tax basis in certain assets to fair value (i.e., “step-up”) to be depreciated and\namortized resulting in an incremental Swiss tax deduction over the transitional period.\nTRAF also provides for parameters which enable the Swiss cantons to establish localized tax rates and regulations\nfor companies. The new cantonal tax parameters include favorable tax benefits for patents and additional research\nand development tax deductions. The cantonal transitional provisions of TRAF allowed companies to elect either 1)\ntax basis step-up similar to the Federal transition benefit or 2) alternative statutory tax rate for a period not\nto exceed 5 years. The Company has operations located in various Swiss cantons.\nDuring the fiscal year 2020, the final canton where the Company maintains significant operations enacted TRAF\nlegislation. Additionally, the Company received rulings from the Swiss Federal and cantonal tax authorities in the\nremaining jurisdictions where it has significant operations. These rulings resulted in the Company revising its\nestimate on the tax basis adjustment (i.e., “step-up”) for its assets and as a result, the Company recorded\nadditional deferred tax benefits in 2020. The Company recognized a net benefit in the fiscal year 2020 for Swiss\nTax Reform of approximately $ 0.4billion or 2.6% benefit to the Company’s annual effective tax rate, comprised of\nthe following items:\napproximately $ 0.3billion tax benefit relating to the remeasurement of Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities\nfor the change in the Federal and cantonal tax rates, where enactment occurred in the fiscal year 2020; this\nbenefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\na $ 450million deferred tax asset related to the estimated value of a Federal tax basis step-up of the Company’s\nSwiss subsidiaries’ assets as described above; this benefit has been reflected as “International Operations” on the\nCompany’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\napproximately $ 0.3billion of U.S. deferred tax expense relating to the GILTI deferred tax liability resulting\nfrom the remeasurement of the Swiss deferred tax assets and liabilities in the fiscal year 2020. This benefit has\nbeen reflected as “U.S. tax on international income” on the Company’s effective tax rate reconciliation.\nThe Company does not expect to receive future rulings regarding the transitional provisions of TRAF.\nAlso, in the fiscal year 2020, the Company recognized a capital loss on certain U.S. affiliates related to the\npreviously impaired book value of certain intangibles, which reduced the 2020 tax rate by approximately 1.2% which\nis reflected as a “Tax benefits from loss on capital assets” on the effective tax rate reconciliation. In addition,\nin the fiscal year 2020, the Company had lower income in higher tax jurisdictions, primarily driven by:\nthe impact of the accrual of litigation costs related to talc for $ 4.0billion which reduced the U.S. earnings\nbefore taxes at an effective tax rate of 23.5%;\nthe accrual of additional legal costs, including an additional $ 1.0billion associated with a revised agreement\nin principle to settle opioid litigation at an effective tax rate of 21.4%\nThe Company also reduced the contingent consideration liability related to the Auris Health acquisition in 2019 and\nreversed some of its unrecognized tax benefits due to the completion of several years of tax examinations in\ncertain jurisdictions during the fiscal year 2020.\n63\nTemporary differences and carryforwards at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021 were as follows:\n2022 Deferred Tax                       2021 Deferred Tax(1)\n(Dollars in Millions)                       Asset    Liability                         Asset    Liability\nEmployee related             $                725                                      1,244\nobligations\nStock based compensation                      687                                        679\nDepreciation of property,\nplant and                                                 -858                                       -876\nequipment\nGoodwill and intangibles                                -4,271    -3                               -2,659    -2\nR&D capitalized for tax                     2,611                                      1,664\nReserves & liabilities                      2,761                                      2,882\nIncome reported for tax                     2,045                                      2,566\npurposes\nNet realizable operating\nloss                                        1,260                                      1,720\ncarryforwards(4)\nUndistributed foreign                       1,565       -1,693                         1,015       -1,461\nearnings\nGlobal intangible                                       -3,547                                     -4,853\nlow-taxed income\nMiscellaneous                               1,053          -65                           870          -39\ninternational\nMiscellaneous U.S.                            476                                                     -16\nTotal deferred income        $             13,183      -10,434                        12,640       -9,904\ntaxes\n(1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\n(2) Amount is inclusive of the $ 2.3billion deferred tax asset established as part of the reorganized ownership\nstructure of certain wholly-owned international subsidiaries, as previously described.\n(3) Amount is inclusive of the $ 1.8billion deferred tax liability due to the acquisition of Abiomed.\n(4) Net of valuation allowances of $ 0.9billion in both 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company has wholly-owned international subsidiaries that have cumulative net losses.

The Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax\naudits in progress with a number of tax authorities. With respect to the United States, the IRS has completed its\naudit for the tax years through 2012 and is currently auditing tax years 2013 through 2016. In the fiscal year\n2020, the Company made its final payments for approximately $ 0.7billion to the U.S. Treasury related to the final\nsettlement of 2010-2012 tax audit liability.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audits go back\nto the year 2008. The Company believes it is possible that some tax audits may be completed over the next twelve\nmonths by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions, including in the United States. However, the Company is not\nable to provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments or change in\nuncertain tax positions, if any.\nThe Company classifies liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties as long-term\nliabilities. Interest expense and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax\nexpense. The Company recognized after tax interest expense of $ 139million, $ 44million and $ 32million in fiscal\nyears 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total amount of accrued interest was $ 651million and $ 512million in\nfiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively.\n64\n9.\nEmployee Related Obligations\n(Dollars in Millions)                 2022     2021\nPension benefits                  $  2,698    4,088\nPostretirement benefits              1,734    2,069\nPostemployment benefits              2,832    3,117\nDeferred compensation                  100      181\nTotal employee obligations           7,364    9,455\nLess current benefits payable          597      557\nEmployee related obligations —    $  6,767    8,898\nnon-current\nPrepaid employee related obligations of $ 4,581million and $ 4,436million for 2022 and 2021, respectively, are\nincluded in Other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n10.\nPensions and Other Benefit Plans\nThe Company sponsors various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit, defined contribution and\ntermination indemnity plans, which cover most employees worldwide. The Company also provides post-retirement\nbenefits, primarily healthcare, to all eligible U.S. retired employees and their dependents.\nMany international employees are covered by government-sponsored programs and the cost to the Company is not\nsignificant.\nIn the U.S, non-union pension benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2015 are primarily based on the\nemployee’s compensation during the last five yearsbefore retirement and the number of years of service (the Final\nAverage Pay formula). U.S. pension benefits for employees hired after 2014, are calculated using a different\nformula based on employee compensation over total years of service (the Retirement Value formula).\nIn January 2021, the Company announced that, effective on January 1, 2026, all eligible U.S. non-union employees,\nregardless of hire date, will earn benefits under the Retirement Value formula. This amendment does not affect the\nbenefits\naccrued under the Final Average Pay formula for service before January 1, 2026.\nInternational subsidiaries have plans under which funds are deposited with trustees, annuities are purchased under\ngroup contracts, or reserves are provided.\nThe Company does not fund retiree healthcare benefits in advance and has the right to modify these plans in the\nfuture.\nIn 2022 and 2021 the Company used December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively, as the measurement date\nfor all U.S. and international retirement and other benefit plans.\nRetirement Plans                        Other Benefit Plans\n(Dollars in Millions)                           2022      2021      2020                   2022    2021    2020\nService cost                     $             1,327     1,421     1,380                    320     309     287\nInterest cost                                    911       770       955                    105      81     133\nExpected return on plan                       -2,757    -2,645    -2,461                     -8      -7      -7\nassets\nAmortization of prior service                   -184      -181         2                     -5     -31     -31\ncost\nRecognized actuarial losses                      655     1,257       891                    121     151     142\n(gains)\nCurtailments and settlements                       1         1        23                      —       —       —\nNet periodic benefit cost        $               -47       623       790                    533     503     524\n(credit)\n65\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses. All other components of net\nperiodic benefit cost are presented as part of Other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of\nEarnings.\nUnrecognized gains and losses for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service\nfor each plan. For plans with no active employees, they are amortized over the average life expectancy. The\namortization of gains and losses for the other U.S. benefit plans is determined by using a 10% corridor of the\ngreater of the market value of assets or the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation. Total unamortized gains\nand losses in excess of the corridor are amortized over the average remaining future service.\nPrior service costs/benefits for the U.S. pension plans are amortized over the average remaining future service of\nplan participants at the time of the plan amendment. Prior service cost/benefit for the other U.S. benefit plans is\namortized over the average remaining service to full eligibility age of plan participants at the time of the plan\namendment.\nRetirement Plans                       Other Benefit Plans\nWorldwide Benefit Plans                          2022       2021    2020                   2022    2021    2020\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nService cost discount rate                       2.46  %    2.14    2.82                   2.59    2.09    3.04\nInterest cost discount rate                      2.80  %    2.34    3.13                   2.64    2.33    3.08\nRate of increase in compensation                 4.02  %    4.01    4.00                   4.21    4.25    4.25\nlevels\nExpected long-term rate of return\non                                               7.25  %    7.71    8.12\nplan assets\nBenefit Obligation\nDiscount rate                                    5.01  %    2.49    2.14                   5.42    2.68    2.23\nRate of increase in compensation                 4.00  %    4.01    4.00                   4.21    4.21    4.27\nlevels\nThe Company’s discount rates are determined by considering current yield curves representing high quality, long-\nterm fixed income instruments. The resulting discount rates are consistent with the duration of plan liabilities.\nThe Company's methodology in determining service and interest cost uses duration specific spot rates along that\nyield curve to the plans' liability cash flows.\nThe expected rates of return on plan asset assumptions represent the Company's assessment of long-term returns on\ndiversified investment portfolios globally. The assessment is determined using projections from external financial\nsources, long-term historical averages, actual returns by asset class and the various asset class allocations

Fair value is based upon\nquoted market prices, where available. If listed prices or quotes are not available, fair value is based upon\nmodels that primarily use, as inputs, market-based or independently sourced market parameters, including yield\ncurves, interest rates, volatilities, equity or debt prices, foreign exchange rates and credit curves.\nWhile the Plan believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the\nuse of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could\nresult in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.\nValuation Hierarchy\nThe authoritative literature establishes a three-level hierarchy to prioritize the inputs used in measuring fair\nvalue. The levels within the hierarchy are described in the table below with Level 1 having the highest priority\nand Level 3 having the lowest.\nThe Net Asset Value (NAV) is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities,\nand then divided by the number of shares outstanding.\nA financial instrument’s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that\nis significant to the fair value measurement.\nFollowing is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value.\nShort-term investment funds — Cash and quoted short-term instruments are valued at the closing price or the\namount held on deposit by the custodian bank. Other investments are through investment vehicles valued using the\nNAV provided by the administrator of the fund. The NAV is a quoted price in a market that is not active and\nclassified as Level 2.\nGovernment and agency securities — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported\non the major market on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active\nmarket, the investments are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted market prices are not\navailable for the specific security, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of\nsecurities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows. When quoted market prices for a security are not\navailable in an active market, they are classified as Level 2.\nDebt instruments — A limited number of these investments are valued at the closing price reported on the major\nmarket on which the individual securities are traded. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, the\ninvestments are classified as Level 1. If quoted market prices are not available for the specific security, then\nfair values are estimated by using pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or\ndiscounted cash flows and are classified as Level 2. Level 3 debt instruments are priced based on unobservable\ninputs.\nEquity securities — Equity securities are valued at the closing price reported on the major market on which the\nindividual securities are traded. Substantially all equity securities are classified within Level 1 of the\nvaluation hierarchy.\nCommingled funds — These investment vehicles are valued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Assets\nin the Level 2 category have a quoted market price.\n69\nOther assets — Other assets are represented primarily by limited partnerships. These investment vehicles are\nvalued using the NAV provided by the fund administrator. Other assets that are exchange listed and actively traded\nare classified as Level 1, while inactively traded assets are classified as Level 2.\nThe following table sets forth the Retirement Plans' investments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2022 and\nDecember 31, 2021:\nQuoted\nPrices\nin\nActive\nMarkets              Signif…\nfor                Other              Signif…            Invest…\nIdenti…              Observ…              Unobse…            Measur…\nAssets               Inputs              Inputs…             at Net\n(Doll…        (Level               (Level               (Level              Asset               Total\nin                1)                   2)                   3)              Value              Assets\nMilli…          2022      2021       2022      2021       2022    2021       2022      2021      2022      2021\nShort…\ninves…    $       33       102         13     1,033          —       —          —         —        46     1,135\nfunds\nGover…\nand                —         —      5,863     7,016          —       —          —         —     5,863     7,016\nagency\nsecur…\nDebt               —         —      3,681     3,505          —       —          —         —     3,681     3,505\ninstr…\nEquity         8,846    14,107          2         2          —       —          —         —     8,848    14,109\nsecur…\nCommi…             —         —      4,362     5,496         56     105      6,106     8,708    10,524    14,309\nfunds\nOther              —         —         33        34         13      15      2,506     1,807     2,552     1,856\nassets\nInves…\nat        $    8,879    14,209     13,954    17,086         69     120      8,612    10,515    31,514    41,930\nfair\nvalue\n(1) The activity for the Level 3 assets is not significant for all years presented.\nThe Company's Other Benefit Plans are unfunded except for U.S. commingled funds (Level 2) of $ 78million and $\n102million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.\nThe fair value of Johnson & Johnson Common Stock directly held in plan assets was $ 21million ( 0.1% of total plan\nassets) at December 31, 2022 and $ 385million ( 0.9% of total plan assets) at December 31, 2021.\n11.\nSavings Plan\nThe Company has voluntary 401(k) savings plans designed to enhance the existing retirement programs covering\neligible employees.

The other current and non-current assets line within the Statement of Cash\nflows includes the impact of foreign currency translation. This equity account includes the results of translating\ncertain balance sheet assets and liabilities at current exchange rates and some accounts at historical rates,\nexcept for those located in highly inflationary economies, (Argentina and Venezuela). Beginning in the fiscal\nsecond quarter of 2022, the Company also accounted for operations in Turkey as highly inflationary.

Common Stock, Stock Option Plans and Stock Compensation Agreements\nAt January 1, 2023, the Company had onestock-based compensation plan. The shares outstanding are for contracts\nunder the Company's 2012 Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. The 2012 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan expired on April 26, 2022. All awards (stock options, restricted shares units and performance share\nunits) granted subsequent to that date were under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan. Under the 2022 Long-Term\nIncentive Plan, the Company may issue up to 150million shares of common stock, of which up to 110million shares of\ncommon stock may be issued subject to stock options or stock appreciation rights and up to 40million shares of\ncommon stock may be issued subject to full value awards. Awards will generally be counted on a 1-for-1 basis\nagainst the share reserve, provided that if more than 40million full value awards are granted, each full value\naward in excess of 40million will be counted on a 5-for-1 basis against the share reserve. Shares available for\nfuture grants under the 2022 Long-Term Incentive Plan were 150million at the end of fiscal year 2022.\nThe compensation cost that has been charged against income for these plans was $ 1,138million, $ 1,135million and $\n1,005million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total income tax benefit recognized in the\nincome statement for share-based compensation costs was $ 196million, $ 218million and $ 210million for fiscal\nyears 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company also recognized additional income tax benefits of $\n282million, $ 223million and $ 248million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, for which options\nwere exercised or restricted shares were vested. The total unrecognized compensation cost was $ 939million, $\n862million and $ 804million for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average period for\nthis cost to be recognized was 1.80years, 1.78years and 1.76years for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively. Share-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were insignificant in all periods.\nThe Company settles employee benefit equity issuances with treasury shares. Treasury shares are replenished through\nmarket purchases throughout the year for the number of shares used to settle employee benefit equity issuances.\n72\nStock Options\nStock options expire 10years from the date of grant and vest over service periods that range from 6months to\n4years. All options are granted at the average of the high and low prices of the Company’s Common Stock on the New\nYork Stock Exchange on the date of grant.\nThe fair value of each option award was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option valuation\nmodel that uses the assumptions noted in the following table. For 2022, 2021, and 2020 grants, expected volatility\nrepresents a blended rate of 10-year weekly historical overall volatility rate, and a 5-week average implied\nvolatility rate based on at-the-money traded Johnson & Johnson options with a life of 2 years. For all grants,\nhistorical data is used to determine the expected life of the option. The risk-free rate was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n2022          2021          2020\nRisk-free rate               1.98    %     0.83    %     1.47    %\nExpected volatility         18.00    %    18.59    %    15.33    %\nExpected life (in years)           7.0           7.0           7.0\nExpected dividend yield      2.70    %     2.50    %     2.60    %\nAggregate\nIntrinsic\nWeighted                       Value\n(Shares in Thousands)          Outstanding Shares       Average Exercise Price       (Dollars in Millions)\nShares at December 29, 2019               111,637    $                  105.63    $                  4,478\nOptions granted                            20,723                       151.41\nOptions exercised                         -16,275                        86.05\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -1,835                       137.62\nShares at January 3, 2021                 114,250                       116.22                       4,703\nOptions granted                            18,525                       164.62\nOptions exercised                         -13,248                        97.48\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -2,166                       149.75\nShares at January 2, 2022                 117,361                       125.36                       5,364\nOptions granted                            19,809                       165.89\nOptions exercised                         -16,310                       100.15\nOptions canceled/forfeited                 -2,188                       160.56\nShares at January 1, 2023                 118,672    $                  134.95    $                  4,949\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 1,228million, $ 919million and $ 1,021million in fiscal years\n2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n73\nThe following table summarizes stock options outstanding and exercisable at January 1, 2023:\n(Shares in     Outstanding                                                 Exercisable\nThousands)\nWeighted                               Weighted\nExercise           Options    Average              Average                     Options    Average\nPrice Range                   Life(1)              Exercise                               Exercise\nPrice                                  Price\n$72.54-$10…         17,221                  1.5                  $93.07         17,221                   $93.07\n$101.87-$1…         22,039                  3.6                 $108.78         22,039                  $108.78\n$129.51-$1…         24,870                  5.7                 $130.88         24,228                  $130.85\n$151.41-$1…         35,465                  7.6                 $157.75            150                  $156.21\n$164.63-$1…         19,077                  9.1                 $165.89             23                  $165.89\n118,672                  5.8                 $134.95         63,661                  $113.06\n(1) Average contractual life remaining in years.\nStock options outstanding at January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 were 117,361and an average life of 5.8years and\n114,250and an average life of 6.0years, respectively.

These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results\nof operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 17.3billion\nand has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2022 acquisitions primarily included Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed). The remaining acquisitions were not\nmaterial.\nOn December 22, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Abiomed, a leading, first-to-market provider of\ncardiovascular medical technology with a first-in-kind portfolio for the treatment of coronary artery disease and\nheart failure which also has an extensive innovation pipeline of life-saving technologies. The transaction broadens\nthe Company’s position as a growing cardiovascular innovator, advancing the standard of care in heart failure and\nrecovery, one of healthcare’s largest areas of unmet need. The transaction was accounted for as a business\ncombination and the results of operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the date of the acquisition.\nThe acquisition was completed through a tender offer for all outstanding shares. The consideration paid in the\nacquisition consisted of an upfront payment of $ 380.00per share in cash, amounting to $ 17.1billion, net of cash\nacquired, as well as a non-tradeable contingent value right (“CVR”) entitling the holder to receive up to $\n35.00per share in cash (which with respect to the CVRs total approximately $ 1.6billion in the aggregate) if\ncertain commercial and clinical milestones are achieved. The corresponding enterprise value (without taking into\naccount the CVRs) of approximately $ 16.5billion includes cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities\nacquired.\nThe milestones of the CVR consist of:\na. $ 17.50per share, payable if net sales for Abiomed products exceeds $ 3.7billion during Johnson & Johnson’s\nfiscal second quarter of 2027 through fiscal first quarter of 2028, or if this threshold is not met during this\nperiod and is subsequently met during any rolling four quarter period up to the end of Johnson & Johnson’s fiscal\nfirst quarter of 2029, $ 8.75per share;\nb. $ 7.50per share payable upon FDA premarket application approval of the use of Impella ® products in ST-elevated\nmyocardial infarction (STEMI) patients without cardiogenic shock by January 1, 2028; and\nc. $ 10.00per share payable upon the first publication of a Class I recommendation for the use of Impella ®\nproducts in high risk PCI or STEMI with or without cardiogenic shock within four years from their respective\nclinical endpoint publication dates, but in all cases no later than December 31, 2029.\nThe fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 19.9billion (net of $ 0.3billion cash\nacquired), primarily to goodwill for $ 10.9billion, amortizable intangible assets for $ 6.6billion, IPR&D for $\n1.1billion, marketable\n82\nsecurities of $ 0.6billion and liabilities assumed of $ 2.8billion, which includes the fair value of the contingent\nconsideration mentioned above for $ 0.7billion and deferred taxes of $ 1.8billion. The goodwill is primarily\nattributable to the commercial acceleration and expansion of the portfolio and is not expected to be deductible for\ntax purposes. The contingent consideration was recorded in Other Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nAs the acquisition occurred in December 2022, the Company is still finalizing the allocation of the purchase price\nto the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation of the purchase price included in the\ncurrent period balance sheet is based on the best estimate of management and is preliminary and subject to change.\nTo assist management in the allocation, the Company engaged valuation specialists to prepare appraisals. The\nCompany will finalize the amounts recognized as the information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. The\nCompany expects to finalize these amounts as soon as possible but no later than one year from the acquisition date.\nThe amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market products of the Impella ® platform\nwith an average weighted life of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved\nproducts. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using probability-adjusted cash flow projections discounted for the\nrisk inherent in such projects. The probability of success factor ranged from 52% to 70%. The discount rate applied\nwas 9.5%.\nIn 2022, the Company recorded acquisition related costs before tax of approximately $ 0.3billion, which was\nrecorded in Other (income)/expense.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, certain businesses were acquired for $ 7.3billion in cash and $ 0.4billion of liabilities\nassumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations\nhave been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $ 7.5billion and\nhas been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\nThe fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which\nhas multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases\nand the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science\ncapabilities.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational\ncompound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech\nInc., for a purchase price of $ 0.8billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-\namortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&D, for $ 0.8billion applying a probability of success factor that\nranged from 20% to 60% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different\nindications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. The transaction was accounted for as a business\ncombination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. In fiscal 2022, the Company recorded an intangible asset\nimpairment charge of approximately $ 0.8billion related to this in-process research and development asset.\nAdditionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares\nin Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares\npreviously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the MedTech\nsegment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily\nIPR&D, for $ 0.4billion, goodwill for $ 0.2billion, other assets of $ 0.2billion and liabilities assumed of $\n0.3billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $\n0.4billion.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $\n6.1billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable\nintangible assets (IPR&D) of $ 6.0billion, goodwill of $ 1.2billion, other assets of $ 0.5billion and liabilities\nof $ 1.6billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal\ndisorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the\nasset, probability of success factors ranging from 20% to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect\ninherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13%. The\ngoodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected\nto be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the\nPharmaceutical segment.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP standards related to business combinations, and goodwill and other intangible assets,\nsupplemental pro forma information for fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 is not provided, as the impact of the\naforementioned acquisitions did not have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations.\nDivestitures\nDuring fiscal year 2022, the Company did not make any material divestitures.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, in separate transactions, the Company divested two brands outside the U.S. within the\nPharmaceutical segment. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain recorded in Other (income) expense, net, of\napproximately $ 0.6billion.\n83\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company sold 11.8million shares of Idorsia LTD (Idorsia), or its 8.3% ownership in the\ncompany at that time. The transaction resulted in gross proceeds of approximately CHF 337million ($ 357million)\nbased on a sales price of CHF 28.55/share and resulted in an immaterial net loss. At the end of fiscal 2020, the\nCompany had rights to approximately 38.7million shares through a convertible loan with a principal amount of CHF\n445million (due June 2027). During fiscal year 2021, the Company converted CHF 110million ($ 120million) of this\nloan into approximately 9.6million shares of Idorsia which were reflected at fair value as of January 2, 2022.\nDuring the fiscal third quarter of 2021, the Company's undrawn credit facility with Idorsia was terminated.\n19.\nLegal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of January 1, 2023, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nPRODUCT LIABILITY\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has established accruals for product liability claims and lawsuits\nin compliance with ASC 450-20 based on currently available information, which in some cases may be limited. The\nCompany accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as\nestimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent\nprojected product liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and\nwith different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information\nbecomes available.\nThe most significant of these cases include: the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing\nSystem; the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; pelvic meshes; RISPERDAL; body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON'S Baby Powder; ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; ELMIRON; and TYLENOL. As of January 1, 2023, in\nthe United States there were approximately 170plaintiffs with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries\nallegedly due to the DePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System; 1,400with respect to the\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System; 9,000with respect to pelvic meshes; 1,100with respect to RISPERDAL; 40,300with\nrespect to body powders containing talc; 2,100with respect to ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh; 2,000with\nrespect to ELMIRON; and 170 with respect to TYLENOL. The number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as\ncertain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional lawsuits are filed.\n84\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established\naccruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability\nlitigation.\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. Prior to 2019, several adverse verdicts had been\nrendered against DePuy, one of which was reversed on appeal and remanded for retrial. During the first quarter of\n2019, DePuy established a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement\nprogram, adverse verdicts have been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability\nlitigation associated with the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nBelgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South\nAfrica. In November 2019, the Federal Court of Australia issued a judgment regarding its findings with respect to\nliability in relation to the three Lead Applicants and generally in relation to the design, manufacture, pre and\npost-market assessments and testing, and supply and promotion of the devices in Australia used to treat stress\nurinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. In September 2022, after exhausting its appeals, the Company\nreached an in-principle agreement to resolve the two pelvic mesh class actions in Australia, pending Federal Court\napproval. In November 2022, the application for approval of the settlement was filed, and a hearing on the\nsettlement has been scheduled for the end of February 2023. The class actions in Canada were discontinued in 2020\nas a result of a settlement of a group of cases and an agreement to resolve the Israeli class action was reached in\nMay 2021. The parties in the Israeli class action are currently finalizing the terms of the settlement. A motion to\napprove the settlement was filed with the Court. The Company has established accruals with respect to product\nliability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of ETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District\n85\nof Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits\npending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits\npending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term\nsheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL\nand MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes\n3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. All deadlines and trial settings in those proceedings are currently stayed pending\nthe completion of the settlement agreement. Of the cases subject to the MSA, 2,236have been dismissed with\nprejudice. Post-settlement cases in the Physiomesh MDL and MCL are subject to docket control orders requiring early\nexpert reports and discovery requirements. As of January 2023, there are approximately 208active cases subject to\nthese orders which are being reviewed and evaluated.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed pending resolution of the proposed\nsettlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject to docket control orders requiring\nearly expert reports and discovery requirements.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with ETHICON\nPHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the\nuse of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. Product liability lawsuits continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive\ninformation with respect to potential costs and the anticipated number of cases. The Company has successfully\ndefended a number of these cases but there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October\n2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in\nJanuary 2020. In September 2021, the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing\nplaintiffs in this matter and in substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs\nassociated with this and other settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\nClaims for personal injury arising out of the use of XARELTO, an oral anticoagulant, have been made against Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI); the Company; and JPI’s collaboration partner for XARELTO, Bayer Healthcare AG, and\ncertain of its affiliates. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-\ndistrict litigation in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. In addition, cases\nwere filed in state courts across the United States. Many of these cases were consolidated into a state mass tort\nlitigation in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and in a coordinated proceeding in Los Angeles, California. Class action\nlawsuits also have been filed in Canada. In March 2019, JPI and the Company announced an agreement in principle to\nsettle the XARELTO cases in the United States; the settlement agreement was executed in May 2019, the settlement\nbecame final in December 2019, and the settlement was funded in January 2020. This resolved the majority of cases\npending in the United States. The Company has established accruals for its costs associated with the United States\nsettlement program and XARELTO related product liability litigation.\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer were made against Johnson & Johnson\nConsumer Inc. and the Company arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby\nPowder. The number of these personal injury lawsuits, filed in state and federal courts in the United States as\nwell as outside of the United States, continued to increase.\nIn talc cases that previously have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there\nalso have been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri\nCourt of Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson &\nJohnson, et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer\nof the case to the Missouri Supreme Court\n86\nwas subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a review of the Ingham decision by the\nUnited States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the award, which, including interest,\ntotaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the terms of the award, were unique to\nthe Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the Company. The Company continues to\nbelieve that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that it has appealed. Notwithstanding\nthe Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain circumstances the Company has settled\ncases.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). As a result of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary restraining order staying all litigation\nagainst LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court confirmed the scope of the\nstay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement and prosecution of talc-\nrelated claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified\nretailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties). The LTL Bankruptcy Case was\ntransferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court\nextended the PI through the end of February 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and,\nfollowing a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March\n2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court simultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected\nParties. The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the\nextension of the stay. In May 2022, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The\nbriefing and oral argument on the appeal were completed in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit\nreversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL\nfiled a petition for rehearing on the decision.\nWhile the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court’s order effectively stays all of the Company’s talc-related personal injury\nlitigation, LTL has agreed to lift the stay on a small number of appeals where appeal bonds have been filed.\nThe Company has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of amounts the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\ndetermines are owed by LTL and the establishment of a $ 2billion trust in furtherance of this purpose. The Company\nhas established a reserve for approximately $ 2billion in connection with the aforementioned trust. After and as a\nresult of the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company de-consolidated LTL, which is a related party. The\nimpact of the de-consolidation is not material to the Company. The parties have not yet reached a resolution of all\ntalc matters in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, and the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss\nbeyond the amount accrued.\nA class action advancing claims relating to industrial talc was filed against the Company and others in New Jersey\nstate court in May 2022 (the Edley Class Action). The Edley Class Action asserts, among other things, that the\nCompany fraudulently defended past asbestos personal injury lawsuits arising from exposure to industrial talc\nmined, milled, and manufactured before January 6, 1989 by the Company’s then wholly owned subsidiary, Windsor\nMinerals, Inc., which is currently a debtor in the Imerys Bankruptcy described hereafter. The Company removed the\nEdley Class Action to federal court in the District of New Jersey. In July 2022, Imerys filed a motion in the\nImerys Bankruptcy to stay the Edley Class Action, which was denied in August 2022. In October 2022, the Company\nfiled motions to dismiss and to deny certification of a class to pursue the Edley Class Action in the New Jersey\nDistrict Court.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition under chapter 11 of\nthe United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware\n(Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury from\nexposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company for\nindemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In May 2020, Imerys, its parent Imerys S.A., the Tort\nClaimants’ Committee (TCC), and the Future Claimants’ Representative (FCR) (collectively, the Plan Proponents)\nfiled their Plan of Reorganization (the Plan) and the Disclosure Statement related\n87\nthereto. The Plan Proponents have since filed numerous amendments to the Plan and Disclosure Statement. A hearing\non the Plan Proponent’s Disclosure Statement was held in January 2021, and the Court entered an order approving the\nDisclosure Statement, allowing Imerys to proceed with soliciting votes on the Plan.\nIn March 2021, the Company voted to reject the Plan and opted out of the consensual releases in the Plan. In April\n2021, the Plan Proponents announced the Plan had received the requisite number of accepting votes to confirm the\nPlan. The Company challenged certain improprieties with respect to portions of the vote and sought to disqualify\nthose votes. In October 2021, the Bankruptcy Court issued a ruling deeming thousands of votes as withdrawn.\nIn October 2021, Imerys cancelled the confirmation hearing on the Plan. Imerys, the TCC, the FCR, certain of\nImerys’s insurers, and certain parties in the Cyprus Mines chapter 11 case (described below) (collectively the\nMediation Parties) agreed to engage in mediation. The most recent term of the mediation ended on December 31, 2022.\nIn July 2021, Imerys commenced an adversary proceeding against the Company in the Imerys Bankruptcy (the Imerys\nAdversary Proceeding). The Imerys Adversary Proceeding sought, among other things, certain declarations with\nrespect to the indemnification obligations allegedly owed by the Company to Imerys. The TCC and FCR simultaneously\nfiled a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from\nundergoing a corporate restructuring that would separate the Company’s talc liabilities from its other assets. The\nBankruptcy Court denied the motion. The Company thereafter filed a motion to dismiss the adversary proceeding. The\nBankruptcy Court has not yet decided the motion to dismiss. In October 2021, the Company filed a Notice of\nBankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case should apply to the Imerys Adversary Proceeding.\nIn June 2020, Cyprus Mines Corporation and its parent, Cyprus Amax Minerals Company (CAMC) (together, Cyprus),\nwhich had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed an adversary proceeding against the Company and Imerys in the\nImerys Bankruptcy seeking a declaration of indemnity rights under certain contractual agreements (the Cyprus\nAdversary Proceeding). The Company denies such indemnification is owed, and filed a motion to dismiss the adversary\ncomplaint. In February 2021, Cyprus filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code\nand filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with\nImerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys\nPlan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain protected parties. Cyprus\nhas not yet sought approval of its Disclosure Statement and Plan. Cyprus, along with the TCC and FCR appointed in\nthe Cyprus chapter 11 case, have agreed to participate in the mediation with the Mediation Parties. In October\n2021, the Company filed a Notice of Bankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay\narising upon the filing of the LTL Bankruptcy Case should apply to the Cyprus Adversary Proceeding. In June 2022,\nCyprus commenced an Adversary Proceeding in its chapter 11 case seeking an order enforcing the automatic stay by\nenjoining parties from commencing or continuing “talc-related claims” against CAMC. In June 2022, the court entered\na preliminary injunction order enjoining claimants from pursuing talc-related claims against CAMC through January\n2023.\nIn February 2021, several of the Company’s insurers involved in coverage litigation in New Jersey State Court (the\nCoverage Action) filed a motion in the Imerys Bankruptcy Court proceeding seeking a determination that the\nautomatic stay does not apply to the Coverage Action and, in the alternative, seeking relief from the automatic\nstay to allow them to continue to litigate their claims in the Coverage Action. In March 2021, the Company filed a\nlimited response and reservation of rights with respect to the motion. The Court entered an agreed order modifying\nthe stay to allow the litigation in the Coverage Action to continue. In October 2021, LTL filed a Notice of\nBankruptcy Filing and Stay of Proceedings clarifying that the automatic stay arising upon the filing of the LTL\nBankruptcy Case should apply to the Coverage Action. In March 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court ruled that the\nLTL automatic stay applied to the Coverage Action.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. Plaintiff is\nseeking damages. In April 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the complaint and briefing on the motion was complete\nas of August 2019. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In March 2020, the Company\nanswered the complaint. In April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. In\nJuly 2021, the Company filed a notice of supplemental authority in opposition to Plaintiff’s motion for class\ncertification, and Plaintiff filed a response. In December 2021, the Company filed a motion to supplement the class\ncertification record, and in January 2022, Plaintiff responded. In March 2022, LTL asked the New Jersey Bankruptcy\nCourt to stay the securities class action. In April 2022, Defendants filed a second motion to supplement the class\ncertification record. In May 2022, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court entered an order staying the securities class\naction. Plaintiff has appealed the Bankruptcy Court’s order.\n88\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\nthe plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In\nJuly 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved\nto dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response\nto those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the\nthird amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court\ngranted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint\nbut indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a\nFifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in\nthe Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice\nof Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its\nresponsive brief in October 2021. In October 2021, Notice of Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth\nCircuit. A bankruptcy stay was imposed in December 2021, and the Court held the reply deadline in abeyance. In\nFebruary 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order extending the stay. The appeal continues to be held in\nabeyance, with the Company being required to file periodic status updates.\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc\nmatters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and\nresponded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of INVOKANA, a prescription medication indicated to\nimprove glycemic control in adults with Type 2 diabetes. In December 2016, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States were organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the District of\nNew Jersey. Cases have also been filed in state courts. Class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada.

Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the coverage and/or validity of the patents on various products and allegations that certain\nof the Company’s products infringe the patents of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity,\n89\nrequire the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any\nassociated intangible asset. Significant matters are described below.\nMedTech\nIn August 2018, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. and Intuitive Surgical Operations, Inc.

In February and March 2020, the USPTO instituted review of the ’447, and\n’906 patents and denied review of the ’276 patent. In March 2021, the USPTO ruled that the challenged claims of the\n’447 and ’906 patents are not invalid.

These ANDAs typically include allegations of non-infringement and invalidity of the\napplicable patents. The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the USPTO, created under the 2011 America Invents\nAct, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits, to challenge the\napplicable patents. In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or the automatic\nstatutory stay of the ANDAs expires before the United States District Court rulings are obtained, the generic\ncompanies involved would have the ability, upon approval of the U.S. FDA, to introduce generic versions of their\nproducts to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the\napplicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In\naddition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can\ninvolve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the\nrelevant patents.\n90\nZYTIGA\nBeginning in January 2019, Janssen Inc., Janssen Oncology, Inc., and BTG International Ltd.

In December 2022, the Arbitration Tribunal issued an Interim Decision\nfinding that Janssen may terminate the agreements, but it may not continue to sell products developed during the\nterm of the agreements without continuing to pay royalties to Alkermes.\nGOVERNMENT PROCEEDINGS\nLike other companies in the pharmaceutical, consumer health and medical devices industries, the Company and certain\nof its subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the\nUnited States and other countries in which they operate. Such regulation has been the basis of government\ninvestigations and litigations. The most significant litigation brought by, and investigations conducted by,\ngovernment agencies are listed below. It is possible that criminal charges and substantial fines and/or civil\npenalties or damages could result from government investigations or litigation.\nAverage Wholesale Price (AWP) Litigation\nThe Company and several of its pharmaceutical subsidiaries (the J&J AWP Defendants), along with numerous other\npharmaceutical companies, were named as defendants in a series of lawsuits in state and federal courts involving\nallegations that the pricing and marketing of certain pharmaceutical products amounted to fraudulent and otherwise\nactionable conduct because, among other things, the companies allegedly reported an inflated Average Wholesale\nPrice (AWP) for the drugs at issue. Payors alleged that they used those AWPs in calculating provider reimbursement\nlevels. The plaintiffs in these cases included three classes of private persons or entities that paid for any\nportion of the purchase of the drugs at issue based on AWP, and state government entities that made Medicaid\npayments for the drugs at issue based on AWP. Many of these cases, both federal actions and state actions removed\nto federal court, were consolidated for pre-trial purposes in a multi-district litigation in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts, where all claims against the J&J AWP Defendants were ultimately\ndismissed. The J&J AWP Defendants also prevailed in a case brought by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Other AWP\ncases have been resolved through court order or settlement. The case brought by Illinois was settled after trial.\nIn New Jersey, a putative class action based upon AWP allegations is pending against Centocor, Inc. and Ortho\nBiotech Inc. (both now Janssen Biotech, Inc.), the Company and ALZA Corporation. All other cases have been\nresolved.\nOpioid Litigation\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The suits also raise allegations related to previously owned active\npharmaceutical ingredient supplier subsidiaries, Tasmanian Alkaloids Pty, Ltd. and Noramco, Inc. (both subsidiaries\nwere divested in 2016). The majority of the cases have been filed by state and local governments. Similar lawsuits\nhave also been filed by private plaintiffs and organizations, including but not limited to the following:\nindividual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome; hospitals; and health\ninsurers/payors. To date, complaints against pharmaceutical manufacturers, including the Company and JPI, have been\nfiled by the state Attorneys General in Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,\nMissouri, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas, Washington\nand West Virginia. Complaints against the manufacturers also have been filed in state or federal court by city,\ncounty and local government agencies in every state but Alaska. The Government of Puerto Rico filed suit in\nSuperior Court of San Juan.\n96\nThe Company, JPI and other pharmaceutical companies had also received subpoenas or requests for information related\nto opioids marketing practices from the following state Attorneys General: Alaska, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire,\nSouth Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Washington. In September 2017, the Company and JPI were contacted by the Texas\nand Colorado Attorney General’s Offices on behalf of approximately 38 states regarding a multi-state Attorney\nGeneral investigation.\nIn 2019, the trial in the matter filed by the Oklahoma Attorney General resulted in a judgment against the Company\nand JPI in the amount of $ 465million. The Company and JPI appealed the judgment, and in November 2021, the\nOklahoma Supreme Court reversed the trial court’s judgment and directed entry of judgment for Defendants. In\nOctober 2019 the Company and JPI announced a settlement of the first case set for trial in the MDL with two\ncounties in Ohio. In April 2021, three California counties and the City of Oakland commenced a trial in California\nstate court against the Company and JPI, and other affiliates, as well as three other pharmaceutical manufacturers.\nThe trial concluded in October 2021, and in December 2021, the Court entered a final trial judgment in favor of\nDefendants on all claims. In February 2022, Plaintiffs’ motion to set aside and vacate the judgment was denied.\nPlaintiffs appealed the judgment, but later filed a request to dismiss the appeal after electing to participate in\nthe national settlement agreement.\nIn October 2019, the Company announced a proposed agreement in principle that would include the Company paying $\n4billion as settlement of these matters that had not been tried or settled. In October 2020, the Company agreed to\ncontribute up to an additional $ 1billion to an all-in settlement amount that would resolve opioid lawsuits filed\nand future claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments, for a total of $ 5billion which has been\naccrued, subject to various conditions and an agreement being finalized. This agreement is not an admission of\nliability or wrong-doing. In July 2021, the Company announced that the terms of the agreement to settle the state\nand subdivision claims had been finalized and approximately half of the all-in settlement was expected to be paid\nby the end of fiscal year 2022, depending upon the level of participation by the states and their subdivisions. The\nterms provided a period of time for states to elect to participate in the agreement and, thereafter, a period for\nthe subdivisions of the participating states to opt-in. Based on expected participation, the Company committed in\nadvance to proceed with the settlement in five of the participating states (New York, Texas, Florida, Nevada, and\nNew Mexico) and with tribal governments. By late February 2022, 45 states, five territories, the District of\nColumbia, and the vast majority of eligible subdivisions had elected to participate in the settlement, and the\nCompany confirmed that the level of participation was sufficient to proceed with the agreement as to all\nparticipants. The agreement was effective in April 2022. Also in April 2022, the Company entered into settlement\nagreements with the states of Alabama and West Virginia and their participating subdivisions. In July 2022, the\nCompany reached a settlement agreement with all litigating Oklahoma subdivisions, and in September 2022, the\nCompany settled with the State of New Hampshire and its participating subdivisions. Consequently, by the end of the\nfiscal year 2022, the Company had settled the opioid claims advanced by all states except Washington.\nThere are approximately 60cases remaining post-settlement in various state courts. There are approximately\n570remaining federal cases against the Company and JPI coordinated in a federal Multi-District Litigation (MDL)\npending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, and approximately 20additional cases pending\nagainst the Company and JPI in other federal courts. In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit\nagainst the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is\nseeking to have that action certified as an opt in class action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the\nfederal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and\nJanssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries),\nmunicipalities and First Nations bands. In October 2019, an antitrust complaint was filed by private plaintiffs in\nfederal court in Tennessee and is pending transfer to the MDL. These actions allege a variety of claims related to\nopioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public nuisance, consumer fraud\nviolations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. The suits generally seek penalties\nand/or injunctive and monetary relief and, in some of the suits, the plaintiffs are seeking joint and several\nliability among the defendants. An adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of\nlarge monetary penalties and significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines,\nequitable remedies and other sanctions.\nIn August 2019, the Company received a grand jury subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern\nDistrict of New York for documents related to the Company’s anti-diversion policies and procedures and distribution\nof its opioid medications, in what the Company understands to be part of a broader investigation into\nmanufacturers’ and distributors’ monitoring programs and reporting under the Controlled Substances Act.\nFrom June 2017 through December 2019, the Company’s Board of Directors received a series of shareholder demand\nletters alleging breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids. The Board retained independent\ncounsel to investigate the allegations in the demands, and in April 2020, independent counsel delivered a report to\nthe Board recommending that the\n97\nCompany reject the shareholder demands and take the steps that are necessary or appropriate to secure dismissal of\nrelated derivative litigation. The Board unanimously adopted the recommendations of the independent counsel’s\nreport.\nIn November 2019, one of the shareholders who sent a demand filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\nCompany has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints\nmaking similar allegations against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal\ncourts in 2019 and 2020. By 2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022,\nthe state court granted the Company’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the\nsecond case filed a notice of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed filed a motion for\nreconsideration. In May 2022, the state court held oral argument on the motion for reconsideration and subsequently\ndenied the motion. The shareholder has appealed the state court’s dismissal order.\nOther\nIn August 2012, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc., DePuy, Inc. (now known as DePuy Synthes, Inc.), and Johnson & Johnson\nServices, Inc. (collectively DePuy) received an informal request from the United States Attorney’s Office for the\nDistrict of Massachusetts and the Civil Division of the United States Department of Justice (the United States) for\nthe production of materials relating to the DePuy ASR XL Hip device. In July 2014, the United States notified the\nUnited States District Court for the District of Massachusetts that it had declined to intervene in a qui tam case\nfiled pursuant to the False Claims Act against the companies concerning the hip devices. In February 2016, the\nDistrict Court granted the companies’ motion to dismiss with prejudice, unsealed the qui tam complaint, and denied\nthe qui tam relators’ request for leave to file a further amended complaint. The qui tam relators appealed the case\nto the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In July 2017, the First Circuit affirmed the District\nCourt’s dismissal in part, reversed in part, and affirmed the decision to deny the relators’ request to file a\nthird amended complaint. In March 2021, DePuy filed its motion to strike and dismiss the relators’ second amended\ncomplaint; the District Court denied DePuy’s motion to strike and dismiss in July 2021. DePuy filed a motion for\nreconsideration of the District Court’s July 2021 ruling. In November 2021, the District Court granted DePuy’s\nmotion for reconsideration and dismissed the case with prejudice. The District Court’s order was unsealed in\nDecember 2021. The relators filed several post-dismissal motions, including a January 2022 omnibus motion for\nreconsideration, which the District Court denied. Following the District Court’s order dismissing the case with\nprejudice, DePuy filed a December 2021 motion seeking the recovery of attorneys’ fees and costs, which the District\nCourt denied except as to costs. The Relators have appealed the District Court’s dismissal of the case to the First\nCircuit. The briefing on the appeal is complete, the First Circuit held oral argument on December 6, 2022, and the\nFirst Circuit’s decision remains pending.\nIn October 2012, the Company was contacted by the California Attorney General’s office regarding a multi-state\nAttorney General investigation of the marketing of surgical mesh products for hernia and urogynecological purposes\nby the Company’s subsidiary, Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon). In May 2016, California and Washington filed civil complaints\nagainst the Company, Ethicon and Ethicon US, LLC alleging violations of their consumer protection statutes. Similar\ncomplaints were filed against the companies by the following states: Kentucky, Mississippi, West Virginia and\nOregon. In April 2019, the Company and Ethicon settled the Washington case. In October 2019, the Company and\nEthicon settled the multi-state investigation with 41 other states and the District of Columbia. In April 2020, the\nCompany settled the West Virginia case. In October 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Oregon.\nIn November 2020, the Company settled with the Attorney General of Mississippi. Trial in the Kentucky matter is\nscheduled for June 2023. The California case started trial in July 2019 and concluded in September 2019. In January\n2020, the Court in California issued a statement of decision, finding in favor of the State of California, and\nawarded civil penalties in the amount of $ 344million. In April 2020, the Court in California denied the Company’s\nmotion for a new trial. In August 2020, the Court entered judgment with respect to the penalties of $ 344million,\nbut denied the Attorney General’s request for injunctive relief. The Company appealed the penalty judgment. In\nApril 2022, the Court of Appeals reduced the judgment to $ 302million, but otherwise denied the appeal. In July\n2022, the Supreme Court of California denied the Company’s petition to review the Court of Appeals decision, and\nthe Company recorded a charge to reflect the judgment in the second quarter of 2022. In November 2022, the Company\npetitioned the United States Supreme Court for review.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District\nof Hinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi\nConsumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc\ncontained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive\nand monetary relief. The Company and JJCI moved for summary judgment on the grounds that the State’s claim was\nbarred by preemption, which the trial court denied. The Mississippi Supreme Court granted the Company and JJCI’s\nrequest to file an interlocutory appeal of the denial of the motion for summary judgment in late 2019. Briefing and\noral argument were completed. Thereafter, the Court\n98\nrejected the interlocutory appeal in April 2021 and remanded the matter to the trial court. In August 2021, JJCI\nfiled a Petition for Writ of Certiorari in the United States Supreme Court as to the Mississippi Supreme Court’s\nruling of April 2021. In December 2021 the United States Supreme Court denied the Petition for Writ of Certiorari.\nAfter the Mississippi Supreme Court remanded the matter to the trial court, the State moved for a trial setting.\nJJCI objected to any trial setting as barred by the stay arising from the LTL Bankruptcy Case, referenced above,\nwhile the State argued that the stay did not apply. In January 2022, the Court granted the State’s motion for trial\nsetting and directed the parties to consult with the Court administrator to secure a trial date. In February 2022,\nthe trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However, given the efforts to resolve talc-\nrelated claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a temporary stay of discovery until\nMay 2022. The temporary stay expired in May 2022. LTL thereafter moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL\nBankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. The State filed an appeal\nto the Third Circuit concerning the stay order.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The State of New Mexico filed an Amended Complaint in March 2020. The\nCompany moved to dismiss certain of the claims in the Amended Complaint, which was granted. The Company then filed\na motion for partial judgment on the pleadings in December 2020, which was denied. In March 2022, the New Mexico\ncourt denied the Company’s motion to compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and\ndenied the Company’s request for interlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ\nof Superintending Control and a Request for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New\nMexico’s discovery obligations. In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, the Company and the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ\nbefore the New Mexico Supreme Court, which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin\nprosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying\nthe case. In December 2022, the State filed an appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately,\nin September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court granted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing\non the scope of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia have commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of\nits talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has not asserted any claims against the Company.\nFive states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents and other information. The Company has\nproduced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and entered into confidentiality agreements.\nThe Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In March 2022, each of the forty-two states\n(including Mississippi and New Mexico) agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July\n2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL\nBankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. LTL moved the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\nfor an order staying further proceedings in those two actions, which the Bankruptcy Court granted in October 2022.\nIn December 2022, the Bankruptcy Court allowed New Mexico and Mississippi to file a direct appeal of its stay.\nIn July 2016, the Company and Janssen Products, LP were served with a qui tam complaint pursuant to the False\nClaims Act filed in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging the off-label\npromotion of two HIV products, PREZISTA and INTELENCE, and anti-kickback violations in connection with the\npromotion of these products. The complaint was filed under seal in December 2012. The federal and state governments\nhave declined to intervene, and the lawsuit is being prosecuted by the relators. The Court denied summary judgment\non all claims in December 2021. Daubert motions were granted in part and denied in part in January 2022, and the\ncase is proceeding to trial.\nIn March 2017, Janssen Biotech, Inc. (JBI) received a Civil Investigative Demand from the United States Department\nof Justice regarding a False Claims Act investigation concerning management and advisory services provided to\nrheumatology and gastroenterology practices that purchased REMICADE or SIMPONI ARIA. In August 2019, the United\nStates Department of Justice notified JBI that it was closing the investigation. Subsequently, the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Massachusetts unsealed a qui tam False Claims Act complaint, which was served on\nthe Company. The Department of Justice had declined to intervene in the qui tam lawsuit in August 2019. The Company\nfiled a motion to dismiss, which was granted in part and denied in part. Discovery is underway.\nIn April and September 2017, the Company received subpoenas from the United States Attorney for the District of\nMassachusetts seeking documents broadly relating to pharmaceutical copayment support programs for DARZALEX, OLYSIO,\nREMICADE, SIMPONI, STELARA and ZYTIGA. The subpoenas also seek documents relating to Average Manufacturer Price and\nBest Price reporting to the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services related to those products, as well as rebate\npayments to state Medicaid agencies. The Company has provided documents in response to the subpoenas.\n99\nIn June 2017, the Company received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of\nMassachusetts seeking information regarding practices pertaining to the sterilization of DePuy Synthes, Inc.\n(DePuy) spinal implants at three hospitals in Boston as well as interactions of employees of Company subsidiaries\nwith physicians at these hospitals. The Company and DePuy fully cooperated with the government’s investigation. In\nJanuary 2023, the Company, DePuy Synthes, Inc., and DePuy Synthes Sales Inc. entered into a settlement agreement\nwith the United States resolving the matter for an immaterial amount.\nIn July 2018, the Public Prosecution Service in Rio de Janeiro and representatives from the Brazilian antitrust\nauthority CADE inspected the offices of more than 30 companies including Johnson & Johnson do Brasil Indústria e\nComércio de Produtos para Saúde Ltda. The authorities appear to be investigating allegations of possible anti-\ncompetitive behavior and possible improper payments in the medical device industry. The Company continues to\nrespond to inquiries regarding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act from the United States Department of Justice and\nthe United States Securities and Exchange Commission.\nFrom time to time, the Company has received requests from a variety of United States Congressional Committees to\nproduce information relevant to ongoing congressional inquiries. It is the policy of Johnson & Johnson to cooperate\nwith these inquiries by producing the requested information.\nGENERAL LITIGATION\nBeginning in September 2017, multiple purported class actions were filed on behalf of indirect purchasers of\nREMICADE against the Company and Janssen Biotech, Inc. (collectively, Janssen) alleging that Janssen has violated\nfederal antitrust laws through its contracting strategies for REMICADE. The cases were consolidated for pre-trial\npurposes as In re REMICADE Antitrust Litigation in United States District Court for the Eastern District of\nPennsylvania.

We also\nhave audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, based on criteria\nestablished in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations\nof the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 1, 2023 and January 2, 2022, and the results of its operations\nand its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 1, 2023 in conformity with\naccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company\nmaintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023,\nbased on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's\ninternal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the\nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect\nto the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Abiomed,\nInc., (“Abiomed”) from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023, because\nit was acquired by the Company in a business combination during 2022. We have also excluded Abiomed from our audit\nof internal control over financial reporting. Abiomed is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total\nsales excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent\nless than 1% of each of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 1, 2023.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n103\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nU.S. Pharmaceutical Rebate Reserves – Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes revenue from product sales\nwhen obligations under the terms of a contract with the customer are satisfied. Rebates and discounts provided to\ncustomers are accounted for as variable consideration and recorded as a reduction in sales. The liability for such\nrebates and discounts is recognized within Accrued Rebates, Returns, and Promotions on the consolidated balance\nsheet. A significant portion of the liability related to rebates is from the sale of pharmaceutical goods within\nthe U.S., primarily the Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid programs, which amounted to $9.6 billion as of January\n1, 2023. For significant rebate programs, which include the U.S. Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid rebate\nprograms, rebates and discounts estimated by management are based on contractual terms, historical experience,\npatient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in the U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. pharmaceutical\nrebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by\nmanagement due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing these reserves and the high degree\nof auditor judgment, subjectivity and audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating the assumptions related\nto contractual terms, historical experience, patient outcomes, trend analysis, and projected market conditions in\nthe U.S. pharmaceutical market.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to U.S. pharmaceutical rebate reserves - Managed Care, Medicare and Medicaid, including controls\nover the assumptions used to estimate these rebates. These procedures also included, among others, (i) developing\nan independent estimate of the rebates by utilizing third party information on price and market conditions in the\nU.S. pharmaceutical market, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical experience and trend\nanalysis of actual rebate claims paid; (ii) testing rebate claims processed by the Company, including evaluating\nthose claims for consistency with the contractual and mandated terms of the Company’s rebate arrangements; and\n(iii) comparing the independent estimates to management’s estimates.\nLitigation Contingencies – Talc\nAs described in Notes 1 and 19 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records accruals for loss\ncontingencies associated with legal matters, including talc, when it is probable that a liability will be incurred\nand the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse awards, judgments, or verdicts have\nbeen rendered against the Company, management does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable\nand can be reasonably estimated. For these matters, management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of\nloss beyond the amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of\njudgments about future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of\nrelated payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors, including,\namong other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and\nlegal discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. Management\ncontinues to believe that the Company has strong legal grounds to contest the talc verdicts it has appealed.\nNotwithstanding management’s confidence in the safety of the Company’s talc products, in certain circumstances the\nCompany has settled cases. In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI), a wholly-owned subsidiary\nof Johnson & Johnson, implemented a corporate restructuring and created a subsidiary, LTL Management LLC (LTL),\nwhich became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities, and another subsidiary, New JJCI, which became\nresponsible for the remaining business of Old JJCI. LTL filed a voluntary petition, seeking relief under chapter 11\nof the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the LTL bankruptcy case, the Court entered a temporary restraining order\nstaying all litigation against LTL and Old JJCI. On November 15, 2021, the North Carolina Bankruptcy Court\nconfirmed the scope of the stay, issuing a Preliminary Injunction (PI) prohibiting and enjoining the commencement\nand prosecution of talc-related claims against LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, Johnson & Johnson, other of their corporate\naffiliates, identified retailers, insurance companies, and certain other parties. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was\ntransferred to the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey in November 2021, and that court\nextended the PI through the end of\n104\nFebruary 2022. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing,\nthe New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions by order issued in March 2022. The New Jersey Bankruptcy Court\nsimultaneously issued another order extending the stay as to the Protected Parties. The claimants subsequently\nfiled notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss and the extension of the stay. In May 2022,the\nThird Circuit Court of Appeals granted the petitions to appeal. The briefing and oral argument on the appeal were\ncompleted in September 2022. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and\nremanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy. LTL has filed a petition for rehearing on the\ndecision.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the talc litigation is a\ncritical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when assessing the likelihood of a loss being\nincurred and when determining whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss for the future and\nexisting talc claims can be made, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort\nin performing procedures and evaluating management’s assessment of the loss contingencies associated with this\nlitigation.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our\noverall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of\ncontrols relating to management’s evaluation of the talc litigation, including controls over determining whether a\nloss is probable and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, as well as financial statement\ndisclosures. These procedures also included, among others, (i) gaining an understanding of the Company’s process\naround the accounting and reporting for the talc litigation; (ii) discussing the status of significant known actual\nand potential litigation and the ongoing LTL bankruptcy proceedings with the Company’s in-house legal counsel, as\nwell as external counsel when deemed necessary; (iii) obtaining and evaluating the letters of audit inquiry with\ninternal and external legal counsel for significant litigation; (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s\nassessment regarding whether an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible or probable and reasonably estimable;\nand (v) evaluating the sufficiency of the Company’s litigation contingencies disclosures.\n/s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFlorham Park, New Jersey\nFebruary 16, 2023\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1920. We have not been able to determine the specific year\nwe began serving as auditor of the Company.\n105\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nUnder Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, management is required to assess the effectiveness of the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year and report, based on that\nassessment, whether the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial\nreporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance as\nto the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of external financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nInternal controls over financial reporting, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore,\ninternal control over financial reporting determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with\nrespect to financial statement preparation and may not prevent or detect all misstatements. Moreover, projections\nof any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate\nbecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Company’s management has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting\nas of January 1, 2023. In making this assessment, the Company used the criteria established by the Committee of\nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” These\ncriteria are in the areas of control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and\ncommunication, and monitoring. The Company’s assessment included extensive documenting, evaluating and testing the\ndesign and operating effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting.\nThe Company acquired Abiomed, Inc. (Abiomed), in a business combination in December 2022. Abiomed's total assets,\nexcluding intangible assets and goodwill, and total sales represented less than 1% of each of the related\nconsolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023. As the acquisition\noccurred in the fiscal year 2022, the scope of the Company's assessment of the design and effectiveness of internal\ncontrol over financial reporting for the fiscal year 2022 excluded the above mentioned acquisition. This exclusion\nis in accordance with the SEC's general guidance that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted\nfrom the scope in the year of acquisition.\nBased on the Company’s processes and assessment, as described above, management has concluded that, as of January\n1, 2023, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2023 has been audited\nby PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which\nappears herein.\n/s/  J.

At the end of the period covered by this Report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the\ntime periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the Company’s\nmanagement, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar\nfunctions, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chairman and\nChief Executive Officer, and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, reviewed and\nparticipated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded that, as of the end of\nthe period covered by this Report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nReports on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. The information called for by this item is incorporated\nherein by reference to “Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting”, and the attestation\nregarding internal controls over financial reporting included in the “Report of Independent Registered Public\nAccounting Firm” included in Item 8 of this Report.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. During the fiscal quarter ended January 1, 2023, there were\nno changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation\nrequired under Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act that have materially affected, or are reasonably\nlikely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to\nmonitor and assess the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.",
