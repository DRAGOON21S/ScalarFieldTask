Cautionary note regarding forward-looking statements

This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and Johnson & Johnson’s other publicly available documents contain “forward-
looking statements” within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Management and representatives of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries (the
Company) also may from time to time make forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements do not relate
strictly to historical or current facts and reflect management’s assumptions, views, plans, objectives and
projections about the future. Forward-looking statements may be identified by the use of words such as “plans,”
“expects,” “will,” “anticipates,” “estimates,” and other words of similar meaning in conjunction with, among other
things: discussions of future operations, expected operating results, financial performance; impact of planned
acquisitions and dispositions; impact and timing of restructuring initiatives including associated cost savings and
other benefits; the Company’s strategy for growth; product development activities; regulatory approvals; market
position and expenditures.

Because forward-looking statements are based on current beliefs, expectations and assumptions regarding future
events, they are subject to uncertainties, risks and changes that are difficult to predict and many of which are
outside of the Company’s control. Investors should realize that if underlying assumptions prove inaccurate, or
known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, the Company’s actual results and financial condition could
vary materially from expectations and projections expressed or implied in its forward-looking statements. Investors
are therefore cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. Risks and uncertainties include, but are
not limited to:

Risks related to product development, market success and competition

• Challenges and uncertainties inherent in innovation and development of new and improved products and technologies
on which the Company’s continued growth and success depend, including uncertainty of clinical outcomes, additional
analysis of existing clinical data, obtaining regulatory approvals, health plan coverage and customer access, and
initial and continued commercial success;

• Challenges to the Company’s ability to obtain and protect adequate patent and other intellectual property rights
for new and existing products and technologies in the United States and other important markets;

• The impact of patent expirations, typically followed by the introduction of competing generic, biosimilar or
other products and resulting revenue and market share losses;

• Increasingly aggressive and frequent challenges to the Company’s patents by competitors and others seeking to
launch competing generic, biosimilar or other products and increased receptivity of courts, the United States
Patent and Trademark Office and other decision makers to such challenges, potentially resulting in loss of market
exclusivity and rapid decline in sales for the relevant product sooner than expected;

• Competition in research and development of new and improved products, processes and technologies, which can
result in product and process obsolescence;

• Competition to reach agreement with third parties for collaboration, licensing, development and marketing
agreements for products and technologies;

• Competition based on cost-effectiveness, product performance, technological advances and patents attained by
competitors; and

• Allegations that the Company’s products infringe the patents and other intellectual property rights of third
parties, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to sell the products in question and require the
payment of money damages and future royalties.

Risks related to product liability, litigation and regulatory activity

• Product efficacy or safety concerns, whether or not based on scientific evidence, potentially resulting in
product withdrawals, recalls, regulatory action on the part of the United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S.
FDA) (or international counterparts), declining sales, reputational damage, increased litigation expense and share
price impact;

• The impact, including declining sales and reputational damage, of significant litigation or government action
adverse to the Company, including product liability claims and allegations related to pharmaceutical marketing
practices and contracting strategies;

• The impact of an adverse judgment or settlement and the adequacy of reserves related to legal proceedings,
including patent litigation, product liability, personal injury claims, securities class actions, government
investigations, employment and other legal proceedings;

• Increased scrutiny of the healthcare industry by government agencies and state attorneys general resulting in
investigations and prosecutions, which carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties, including, but
not limited to, debarment from government business;

• Failure to meet compliance obligations in compliance agreements with governments or government agencies, which
could result in significant sanctions;

• Potential changes to applicable laws and regulations affecting United States and international operations,
including relating to: approval of new products; licensing and patent rights; sales and promotion of healthcare
products; access to, and reimbursement and pricing for, healthcare products and services; environmental protection;
and sourcing of raw materials;

• Compliance with local regulations and laws that may restrict the Company’s ability to manufacture or sell its
products in relevant markets, including requirements to comply with medical device reporting regulations and other
requirements such as the European Union’s Medical Devices Regulation;

• Changes in domestic and international tax laws and regulations, increasing audit scrutiny by tax authorities
around the world and exposures to additional tax liabilities potentially in excess of existing reserves; and

• The issuance of new or revised accounting standards by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and regulations
by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Risks related to healthcare market trends and the realization of benefits from the Company's strategic initiatives

• Pricing pressures resulting from trends toward healthcare cost containment, including the continued consolidation
among healthcare providers and other market participants, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments
increasingly becoming the primary payors of healthcare expenses, significant new entrants to the healthcare markets
seeking to reduce costs and government pressure on companies to voluntarily reduce costs and price increases;

• Restricted spending patterns of individual, institutional and governmental purchasers of healthcare products and
services due to economic hardship and budgetary constraints;

• Challenges to the Company’s ability to realize its strategy for growth including through externally sourced
innovations, such as development collaborations, strategic acquisitions, licensing and marketing agreements, and
the potential heightened costs of any such external arrangements due to competitive pressures;

• The potential that the expected strategic benefits and opportunities from any planned or completed acquisition or
divestiture by the Company may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;

• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to past and ongoing restructuring actions may
not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected;

• The Company’s ability to divest the Company’s remaining ownership interest in Kenvue Inc. (Kenvue) and realize
the anticipated benefits from the separation; and

• Kenvue's ability to succeed as a standalone publicly traded company.

Risks related to economic conditions, financial markets and operating internationally

• The risks associated with global operations on the Company and its customers and suppliers, including foreign
governments in countries in which the Company operates;

• The impact of inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates and the potential effect
of such fluctuations on revenues, expenses and resulting margins;

• Potential changes in export/import and trade laws, regulations and policies of the United States and other
countries, including any increased trade restrictions or tariffs and potential drug reimportation legislation;

• The impact on international operations from financial instability in international economies, sovereign risk,
possible imposition of governmental controls and restrictive economic policies, and unstable international
governments and legal systems;

• The impact of global public health crises and pandemics;

• Changes to global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters that could affect demand for the Company’s
products and services, cause disruptions in manufacturing and distribution networks, alter the availability of
goods and services within the supply chain, and affect the overall design and integrity of the Company’s products
and operations;

• The impact of global or economic changes or events, including global tensions and war; and

• The impact of armed conflicts and terrorist attacks in the United States and other parts of the world, including
social and economic disruptions and instability of financial and other markets.
                                                                                                                   
   Risks related to supply chain and operations                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
• Difficulties and delays in manufacturing, internally, through third-party providers or otherwise within the
supply chain, that may lead to voluntary or involuntary business interruptions or shutdowns, product shortages,
withdrawals or suspensions of products from the market, and potential regulatory action;

• Interruptions and breaches of the Company’s information technology systems or those of the Company’s vendors,
which could result in reputational, competitive, operational or other business harm as well as financial costs and
regulatory action;

• Reliance on global supply chains and production and distribution processes that are complex and subject to
increasing regulatory requirements that may adversely affect supply, sourcing and pricing of materials used in the
Company’s products; and

• The potential that the expected benefits and opportunities related to restructuring actions may not be realized
or may take longer to realize than expected, including due to any required approvals from applicable regulatory
authorities.

Investors also should carefully read the Risk Factors described in Item 1A of the Company's Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023, for a description of certain risks that could, among other
things, cause the Company’s actual results to differ materially from those expressed in its forward-looking
statements. Investors should understand that it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors and should
not consider the risks described above to be a complete statement of all potential risks and uncertainties. The
Company does not undertake to publicly update any forward-looking statement that may be made from time to time,
whether as a result of new information or future events or developments.

Supplier finance program obligations

The Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions. These programs
provide participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with the third-party
financial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the third-party
financial institutions. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment
dates (which have general payment terms of 90days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to
participate in the program.

As of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, $ 0.6billion and $ 0.7billion, respectively, were valid obligations
under the program. The obligations are presented as Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company uses forward foreign exchange contracts to manage its exposure to the variability of cash flows,
primarily related to the foreign exchange rate changes of future intercompany product and third-party purchases of
materials denominated in a foreign currency. The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency
risk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.

Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed
rate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest
rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company
uses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.
These forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of
these derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign
currency assets and liabilities.

The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that
contain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain
derivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting
agreements. As of March 31, 2024, the cumulative amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA
amounted to $ 2.2billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company
monitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the
Company primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit
rating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this
footnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had
notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and
interest rate swaps of $ 43.2billion, $ 39.6billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the
Company had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps
and interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively.

All derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of
derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the
derivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.

The designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all
derivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are
accounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in
the income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then
reclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.

Gains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to
changes in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on
net investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other
comprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense
using the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly
effective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly
effective, hedge accounting is discontinued.

The Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2024 to 2035 as a net investment
hedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their
functional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.

As of March 31, 2024, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive
income was $ 795million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive
Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange
contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected
to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is
18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount ultimately realized in
earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual
exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.

* Includes the 9.5% remaining stake in Kenvue and the unfavorable change in the fair value of the investment.

Fair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is
a market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or
liability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in
measuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest
priority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.

The fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate
contracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the
prevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange
rate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the
amounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material
effect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity
investments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds
acquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are
classified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques
for which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.

The following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:

Level 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.

Level 2 — Significant other observable inputs.

Level 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.

  Note 5 — Income taxes                                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
The worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal first quarters of 2024 and 2023 were 12.4% and 61.8%,
respectively. The change in the consolidated tax rate as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter is
primarily due to a charge of $ 6.9billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2023 and a charge of $ 2.7billion in the
fiscal first quarter of 2024, both for the talc settlement proposal. Both charges were recorded at an effective
U.S. federal and state tax rate of approximately 23% (for further information see Note 11 to the Consolidated
Financial Statements).

Additionally in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the effective tax rate was impacted by legislative changes that
went into effect for Pillar Two in some of the Company's foreign jurisdictions. The Company also had tax benefits
received from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or vested during each of the fiscal first
quarters, as well as a capital loss tax benefit in the fiscal first quarter of 2024.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $ 2.5billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The
Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a
number of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit
for the tax years through 2016 and in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 has commenced the audit for tax years 2017
through 2020.

In other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back
to the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months
by taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to
provide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax
positions.

44.2million shares related to stock options, as the exercise price of these options was greater than the average
market value of the Company’s stock.

Subsequent to the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive
agreement to acquire all outstanding shares of Shockwave Medical, Inc. (Shockwave) (Nasdaq: SWAV), a leading,
first-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the treatment of calcified
coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), for $ 335.00per share in cash, corresponding to
an enterprise value of approximately $ 13.1billion including cash acquired. The results of operations will be
included in the MedTech segment as of the acquisition date. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by
mid–year 2024.

On March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a clinical-stage
biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-
generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of
approximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.8billion net of cash acquired. The Company acquired all of the outstanding
shares of Ambrx’s common stock for $ 28.00per share through a merger of Ambrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The
transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations were included in the
Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets
acquired of $ 2.3billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $
1.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.5billion, which includes deferred taxes of $
0.4billion. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the
measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 40% to 70% was used in the fair value calculation
to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 17%.
The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal first quarter of
2024 were not material.

Divestitures

In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Ponvory resulting in approximately $
0.2billion in proceeds.

There were no material acquisitions or divestitures in the fiscal first quarter of 2023.
                                                                                                                   
  Note 11 — Legal Proceedings                                                                                      
                                                                                                                   
Johnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product
liability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and
other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.

The Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a
liability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of March 31, 2024, the
Company has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be
reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal
issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance
with ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is
probable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the
amounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about
future events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related
payments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among
other things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal
discovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal
uncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and
unpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;
complexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent
adverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an
accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.

In the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with
counsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is
not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or
increase in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect
on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.

Matters concerning talc

A significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against Johnson
& Johnson Consumer Inc., its successor LTL Management LLC (now known as LLT Management LLC) and the Company arising
out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.

In talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have
been verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of
Appeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson,
et al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the
case to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a
review of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the
award, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the
terms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the
Company. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that
it has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain
circumstances the Company has settled cases.

In October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021
Corporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and threenew entities were
created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a
North Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,
Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets
and became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in
any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or
exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such
damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’
compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).

In October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a
voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte
Division, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against
LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance
companies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to
the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL
Bankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in
March 2022.

The claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy
Case and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the
Bankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.

In April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as
to all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy
Case). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to
section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining
order staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other
parties (the New Protected Parties).

Also in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the
Company and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained
in force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary
Injunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for in those cases filed in the federal
court ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was
permitted to proceed.

Furthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed
by similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023,
the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the
decision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy
Court entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October
2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. Briefing is ongoing.

In October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to
achieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision;
(ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its
dismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative
claims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products.

Following the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were
reactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a
multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL,
case-specific discovery is proceeding with an expectation that a trial will occur in early 2025. In March 2024, the
court granted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert hearing and set a briefing schedule.

On May 1, 2024, the Company commenced a three-month solicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged”
chapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the “Proposed Plan”) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and
future claims related to
                                                                                                                   
  26

cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims,
in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $ 6.475billion payable over 25years
(nominal value of approximately $ 8.4billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The claims encompassed by the Proposed
Plan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its talc powder products. Mesothelioma
and State consumer protection claims are being addressed outside the Proposed Plan. The Company separately has
resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date, and has agreements in principle to resolve the State
claims.

To account for these settlements and the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the
Company recorded an incremental charge of approximately $ 2.7billion, for a total reserve as of the first fiscal
quarter 2024 at a present value of approximately $ 11billion (or nominal value of approximately $ 13.7billion).
Approximately one-third of the reserve is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the
Company's best estimate of probable loss.

During the pendency of the solicitation period, the Company will continue to pursue in parallel the other three
previously-announced pathways to resolve the talc claims, including proceeding with the Daubert motions in the MDL.

In February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc
Vermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under
chapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District
of Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury
from exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company
for indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan
(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its
alleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust
would pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification
from the Company.

In February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary
petition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus
Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary
contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims
asserted against it and certain affiliated parties.

The Imerys Plan proceeded to solicitation in early 2021. However, the Imerys Plan did not receive the requisite
number of votes to be confirmed after the Bankruptcy Court ruled certain votes cast in favor of the Imerys Plan
should be disregarded. Imerys subsequently canceled its confirmation hearing.

After the confirmation hearing was canceled, Imerys, the Imerys Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Imerys Future
Claimants’ Representative, along with Cyprus, the Cyprus Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Cyprus Future
Claimants’ Representative engaged in mediation. The Bankruptcy Court also authorized Imerys and Cyprus to proceed
with mediation with certain of their insurers.

In September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar
construct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain
other protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights
against the Company. In January 2024, Imerys and Cyprus each filed a disclosure statement for its respective
Chapter 11 plans. On April 29, 2024, the Company, Imerys and Cyprus reached an agreement in principle on monetary
and non-monetary terms to resolve their ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus
bankruptcies.

In February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the
United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal
securities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily
JOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the
Company moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In
April 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. The case was stayed in May 2022
pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s
motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit under Federal
Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class certification, and in
February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. Fact discovery closed in February 2024 and the Court
ordered the parties to mediate. The Court stayed the case pending the mediation, which is scheduled for May 2024.

A lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging
violations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,
the plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In
July 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of
California and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved
to dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response
to those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the
third amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court
granted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint
but indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a
Fifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to
state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in
the Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss

with prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed
their opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its responsive brief in October 2021. After the Notice of
Suggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit, a stay was imposed, and the Court held the reply
deadline in abeyance. In September 2023, the stay lifted. On April 29, 2024, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the
District Court's order dismissing the case with prejudice.

In June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District
of Hinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as
Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi
Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc
contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive
and monetary relief. In February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However,
in October 2022, the LTL bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued
the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL
Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to this matter. The State requested a new trial setting. Later in
April 2023, the trial court set a new trial date for April 2024. The Company filed summary judgment and Daubert
motions. The State filed a limited Daubert motion. The parties agreed to the Court's request for mediation. The
Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.

In January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively
marketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the
presence of carcinogens, including asbestos. In March 2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company’s motion to
compel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and denied the Company’s request for
interlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a
Request for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations.
In April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and
the State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court,
which expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy
Case. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In December 2022, the State filed an
appeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court
granted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s
discovery obligations. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and
in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as
to this matter. While the State notified the New Mexico Supreme Court of the lifted stay of litigation in April
2023, the Court has not taken any action since being notified of the lifting of the stay and it remains in effect.
The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.

Forty-two states and the District of Columbia (including Mississippi and New Mexico) have commenced a joint
investigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has
not asserted any claims against the Company. Five states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents
and other information. The Company has produced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and
entered into confidentiality agreements. The Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In
March 2022, each of the forty-two states agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July
2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL
Bankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. In March 2023, the mediation was
terminated. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state
Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. The unique procedural history and status
of the New Mexico and Mississippi matters specifically have been discussed above.

In addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc
matters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and
responded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.

Matters concerning opioids

Beginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with
other pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,
including DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases were filed by state and local governments,
which were subject to a final settlement in 2021. As of January 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or otherwise
resolved the opioid claims advanced by all government entity claimants except the City of Baltimore, a number of
school districts, and other claimants. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and
organizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with
Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.

To date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at
trial or on appeal.

In July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle all remaining state and subdivision
claims for up to $ 5.0billion. Approximately 60% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal first
quarter 2024, and will increase to approximately 75% by fiscal year end 2024.
                                                                                                                   
  28                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
Table of Contents

The Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as
the cases brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, hospitals, and health insurers/payors. Counting
the private litigant cases, there are approximately 35remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various
state courts, 435remaining cases in the Ohio MDL, and 4additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these
cases have been dismissed and are being appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in
2024, 2025, or 2026.

In addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen
Inc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class
action on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class
actions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on
behalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. These actions
allege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition,
public nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. An
adverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and
significant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other
sanctions.

In November 2019, a shareholder filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the nominal defendant and
certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint
alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages
as a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations
against the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By
2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted the
Company’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice
of dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed appealed the state court’s dismissal order, and
briefing on the appeal concluded in October 2022. In February 2024, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of
the shareholder's amended complaint. In March 2024, the shareholder filed a notice of petition for certification
with the Supreme Court of New Jersey seeking review of the appellate court's decision.

Product liability

The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits
involving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive
damages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome
of litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements
based on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each
related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in
accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to
defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the
Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other
losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the
world, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be
required in the future as additional information becomes available.
The table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in
the United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product

DePuy ASR XL acetabular system and ASR Hip resurfacing system

In August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular
System and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury
have been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been
organized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.
Litigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,
Australia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed
committee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip
patients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August
2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement
program to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.
This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip
litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program
does not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that
resolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached
agreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with
respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established
accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability
litigation.

DePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System

Claims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,
DePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits
continue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the
anticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a
multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).
Beginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the
Texas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed
in state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established
a United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have
been settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE
Acetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.

Ethicon Pelvic Mesh

Claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s
pelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to
receive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the
United States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court
has remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh
lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the
majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining
cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or
claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in
various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,
Belgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South
Africa. The vast majority of these actions are now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to
product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.

Ethicon Physiomesh

Following a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),
claims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury
arising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been
organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of
Georgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic
County for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional
lawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL
for polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed
for Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In
May 2021, Ethicon
                                                                                                                   
  30                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
Table of Contents

and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases
(covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement
(MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other than a small number of
cases still pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been resolved or are undergoing
formal review for purposes of settlement.

Claims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED
Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order
consolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have
been filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United
States.

Ethicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE
Polypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County
Superior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state
courts in the United States.

In October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of
the pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh
products, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed
pending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject
to docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.

The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon
Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System
products.

Innovative Medicine

RISPERDAL

Claims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the
use of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed
episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been
filed in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the
United States and Canada. The Company continues to defend RISPERDAL product liability lawsuits, and continues to
evaluate potential costs related to those claims. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but
there have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive
damages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021,
the Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in
substantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other
settlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.

ELMIRON

Claims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for
the relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that
ELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state
and federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United
States, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district
litigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been
filed in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen
County, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort
designation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. The Company continues to defend
ELMIRON product liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential costs related to those claims. Other than a
small number of cases in the MDL filed by one law firm, all U.S. based ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are
undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity
costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.

Intellectual Property

Certain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to
patent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters
involve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that
certain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these
subsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all
significant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases
could adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to
loss of market

exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment
charge for any associated intangible asset.

Innovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)

The Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA
(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various
subsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits
typically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication
“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of
these lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic
version of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the
Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court
rulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce
generic versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and
revenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated
intangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and
such settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to
the expiration of the relevant patents.

The Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the
2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits
to challenge the applicable patents.

XARELTO

Beginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer Intellectual Property
GmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have
filed ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed
Patents. The following entities are named defendants: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.; Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories,
Ltd.; Lupin Limited; Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A.,
Inc.; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Mylan Inc.; Mankind Pharma Limited; Apotex Inc.;
Apotex Corp.; Auson Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Auson Pharmaceuticals Co. Ltd.; Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd; Macleods
Pharma USA, Inc.; Indoco Remedies Limited; FPP Holding Company LLC; Umedica Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.; Aurobindo
Pharma Limited; Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc.; Cipla Ltd.; Cipla USA Inc.; InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Prinston
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The following U.S. patents are included in one or more cases: 9,539,218 and 10,828,310. In
January 2024, the Company entered into a confidential settlement agreement with Macleods Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and
Macleods Pharma USA, Inc. In February 2024, the Company entered into confidential settlement agreements with Apotex
Inc. and Apotex Corp. (as to U.S. Patent No. 9,539,218), as well as Indoco Remedies Limited and FPP Holding Company
LLC. In March 2024, the Company entered into confidential settlement agreements with Umedica Laboratories Pvt. Ltd.

U.S. Patent No. 10,828,310 was also under consideration by the USPTO in an IPR proceeding. In July 2023, the USPTO
issued a final written decision finding the claims of the patent invalid. In September 2023, Bayer Pharma AG filed
an appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

OPSUMIT

Beginning in January 2023 Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Actelion Pharmaceuticals US, Inc. filed patent
infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking

Immunology products achieved operational growth of 4.6% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales of STELARA
(ustekinumab) were driven by market growth and share gains in Inflammatory Bowel Disease partially offset by
unfavorable patient mix. Growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains. Additionally,
SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA growth was driven by growth outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to
biosimilar competition.

Sales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed
abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA.
The Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a
result of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the
launch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States. The latest expiring European
composition of matter patent (Supplementary Protection Certificate) expires in 2024 in most European Union Member
States and the United Kingdom.

Biosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United
States and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will
result in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.

Infectious disease products experienced an operational decline of 48.3% as compared to the same period a year ago
primarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue. The Company expects an insignificant amount of COVID-19
vaccine revenue in fiscal 2024.

Neuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 2.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. The
growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by increased physician and patient demand. Growth was partially offset
by declines in RISPERDAL CONSTA.

Oncology products achieved operational sales growth of 18.8% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong
sales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions. Growth of ERLEADA
(apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth. Increased sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene
autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally,
sales from the ongoing launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and the launch of TALVEY (talquetamab) and RYBREVANT
(amivantamab) in Other Oncology contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone
acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) declines due to global competitive pressures.

Pulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 22.4% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales
growth was due to favorable patient mix, market growth and share gains from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT
(macitentan).

Cardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 10.5% as compared to the same
period a year ago. The decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and
share loss.

The Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location
other than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B
covered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee
covered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been
and will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it
believes its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited
by the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug
manufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities.

The Surgery franchise achieved operational sales growth of 1.9% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter.
The decline in Advanced Surgery was primarily driven by competitive pressures and volume-based procurement impacts
in Endocutters and Energy partially offset by Biosurgery global procedure growth, strength of the portfolio and
commercial execution as well as uptake of new products in Endocutters and Energy. The operational growth in General
Surgery was primarily driven by increased procedures coupled with technology penetration and upgrades within the
differentiated Wound Closure portfolio. The growth was partially offset by fewer selling days.

The Orthopaedics franchise achieved operational sales growth of 4.8% as compared to the prior year fiscal first
quarter. The fiscal first quarter of 2024, includes a one-time revenue recognition timing change related to certain
products across all Orthopaedic platforms in the U.S. which positively impacted the worldwide Orthopaedics
franchise growth by approximately 3.0%. The operational growth in Hips reflects global procedure growth, continued
strength of the portfolio and the aforementioned revenue recognition timing change partially offset by Russia
Sanctions and one less selling day. The operational growth in Knees was primarily driven by procedures, continued
strength of the ATTUNE portfolio, pull through related to the VELYS Robotic assisted solution, the aforementioned
revenue recognition timing change and timing of tenders outside the U.S. partially offset by one less selling day.
The operational growth in Trauma was driven by the aforementioned revenue recognition timing change and the
continued adoption of recently launched products. This was partially offset by U.S. competitive challenges, one
less selling day, weather-related softness in core trauma and volume-based procurement impacts. The operational
growth in Spine, Sports & Other was primarily driven by growth in Digital Solutions, Craniomaxillofacial,
Shoulders, and the aforementioned revenue recognition timing change partially offset by Spine competitive pressures
and one less selling day.

The Cardiovascular franchise (previously referred to as Interventional Solutions) achieved operational sales growth
of 22.5% as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter. Electrophysiology grew by double digits due to global
procedure growth, new product uptake, commercial execution and Asia Pacific distributor inventory dynamics
partially offset by the impacts of volume-

based procurement in China and fewer selling days. Abiomed sales reflect the strength of all major commercialized
regions driven by continued strong adoption of Impella 5.5 and Impella RP.

The Vision franchise experienced an operational sales decline of 1.4% as compared to the prior year fiscal first
quarter. The Contact Lenses/Other operational decline was primarily driven by U.S. stocking dynamics, the impact of
the Blink divestiture in the fiscal third quarter of 2023 and economic pressures in Asia Pacific partially offset
by the continued strong performance in the ACUVUE OASYS 1-Day family of products (including recent launches) and
price actions. The Surgical operational growth was primarily driven by the continued strength of recent innovations
and commercial execution partially offset by preparation for volume-based procurement implementation in China and
refractive softness in the U.S.

Interest income in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $364 million as compared to $198 million in the fiscal
first quarter of 2023 primarily due to higher rates of interest earned on cash balances. Interest expense in the
fiscal first quarter of 2024 was $155 million as compared to $212 million in the same period a year ago primarily
due to a lower average debt balance. The balance of cash, cash equivalents and current marketable securities was
$26.2 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024 as compared to $32.3 billion (including $7.7 billion
of restricted cash related to Kenvue) at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2023. The Company’s debt position
was $33.6 billion as of March 31, 2024, as compared to $52.9 billion the same period a year ago (including $7.7
billion related to Kenvue debt).

The Innovative Medicine segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was
36.6% versus 32.8% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for
the fiscal first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:

• One-time COVID-19 Vaccine related exit costs of $0.4 billion in 2023

• Favorable patient mix in Cost of products sold

partially offset by

• An increase in brand marketing investment

• Higher administrative costs

• Higher investments in research and development

The MedTech segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was 19.4% versus
18.8% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal
first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:

• An IPR&D charge in 2023 of approximately $0.1 billion related to the Pulsar Vascular acquisition in the fiscal
year 2016

• Research and development expense phasing

partially offset by

• Macroeconomic factors and unfavorable currency in Cost of products sold

In the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment
within the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to
patients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are
primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus
(RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1
billion in both the fiscal first quarters of 2024 and 2023, included the termination of partnered and non-partnered
program costs and asset impairments. Total project costs of approximately $0.6 billion have been recorded since the
restructuring was announced.

In the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within its
MedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network
arrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $27 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, of which $20
million was recorded in Restructuring and $7 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated
Statement of Earnings, primarily included costs related to market and product exits. Total project costs of
approximately $0.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.

The worldwide effective income tax rate for the fiscal three months was 12.4% in 2024 and 61.8% in 2023.

On December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which
generally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-
operation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. Several
EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with
other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that as result of this legislation
the 2024 effective tax rate will increase by 1.5% (150 basis points) compared to fiscal 2023. Further legislation,
guidance and regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well as other business events, may impact this
estimate.

Statements.

As of March 31, 2024, the Company's cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was approximately $26.2
billion and had approximately $33.6 billion of notes payable and long-term debt for a net debt position of $7.4
billion as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter net debt position of $20.6 billion (which included cash
of $1.7 billion and debt of $7.7 billion related to Kenvue). The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the
ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and
access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs,
including the Company’s remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately
$2.1 billion and the approximately $11.0 billion ($13.7 billion nominal) reserve remaining for the talc settlement
proposal (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company
monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market
conditions are favorable.

Subsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company paid approximately $2.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury, including $2.0
billion related to the current installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge (see
Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year
ended December 31, 2023) and $0.6 billion primarily related to the normal estimated payment for the fiscal first
quarter of 2024.

In July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the
Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that
the IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and
therefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the
district court’s denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.

Although the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the
financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory
reserves, was not material. As of the fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2024, and the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s
consolidated assets and revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue
separation.

In March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any
additional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare
purposes.

Although the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the
financial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory
reserves, was not material. As of the fiscal three months ending March 31, 2024, and the fiscal year ending
December 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented approximately 1% of the Company’s
consolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.
                                                                                                                   
  Other Macroeconomic Considerations                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
The Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.
The Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency
exchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company
operates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey as highly inflationary, as
the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives
to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price
increases.

Governments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing
or decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are
required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater
audit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in
the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the
period in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the
Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the
countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or
benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.

The Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that
include health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of
health care products.

Changes in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying
medical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing
healthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the
Company’s businesses.

The Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar
manufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products
prior to the expiration of the applicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or
abbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the
Company’s patents. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the
resulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market,
resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result
in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors
could launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one
or more valid patents are in place.

Disclosure controls and procedures. At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the
effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the
reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,
within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without
limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in
the reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the
Company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing
similar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief
Executive Officer; Chairman, Executive Committee and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial
Officer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded
that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were
effective.

Internal control. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control
over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the
Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness
of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.

The Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize
processes and

systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance functions. These are

enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and standardize financial
systems.

This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the Company’s internal control over
financial

reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will continue to align and streamline the design and
operation of

its financial control environment.
