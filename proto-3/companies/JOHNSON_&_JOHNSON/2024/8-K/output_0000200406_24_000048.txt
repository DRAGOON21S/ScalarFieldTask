Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On May 1, 2024, Johnson & Johnson issued the attached earnings schedules for the first quarter ended March 31,
2024. These schedules have been amended to reflect the information referenced in Item 7.01
                                                                                                                   
  Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
On May 1, 2024, the Company announced a proposed Plan of Reorganization (the “Proposed Plan”) for the comprehensive
and final resolution of all current and future claims related to ovarian cancer arising from cosmetic talc
litigation in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims, in
exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $6.475 billion payable over 25 years
(nominal value of approximately $8.4 billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). To account for these settlements and
the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the Company recorded an incremental charge of
approximately $2.7 billion, for a total reserve as of the first fiscal quarter 2024 at a present value of
approximately $11 billion (nominal value of approximately $13.7 billion).

The Proposed Plan is a recognized subsequent event and previously reported GAAP net earnings for the fiscal first
quarter ended March 31, 2024 is reduced from $5.4 billion to $3.3 billion. Previously reported earnings per share
(EPS) for the fiscal first quarter ended March 31, 2024 is reduced from $2.20 to $1.34. There is no impact to
previously reported Adjusted Earnings, Adjusted EPS and Adjusted Operational EPS for the fiscal first quarter ended
March 31, 2024.
