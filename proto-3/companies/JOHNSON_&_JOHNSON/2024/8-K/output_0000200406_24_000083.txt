On September 20, 2024, the Company announced that its subsidiary, Red River Talc LLC (“Red River”), filed a
voluntary prepackaged Chapter 11 bankruptcy case today in the in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of
Texas Houston Division to fully and finally resolve of all current and future claims related to ovarian cancer
arising from cosmetic talc litigation against the Company and its affiliates in the United States. Red River filed
the bankruptcy case after it received the support of the overwhelming majority (approximately 83%) of the current
claimants for the proposed bankruptcy plan (the “Plan”). After extensive negotiations with counsel for claimants
who initially opposed the Plan, Red River agreed to increase its contribution to the settlement by $1.75 billion to
a present value of approximately $8 billion.
