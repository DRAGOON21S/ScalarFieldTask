Item 2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition

On October 19, 2021, Johnson & Johnson issued the attached press release announcing its sales and earnings for the
third quarter ended October 3, 2021.
                                                                                                                   
  Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure                                                                               
                                                                                                                   
Subsequent to the quarter, the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary LTL Management LLC (LTL), a newly created and
separate subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, that was established to hold and manage claims in the cosmetic talc
litigation, has filed for voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. This filing is intended to resolve all claims
related to cosmetic talc in a manner that is equitable to all parties, including any current and future claimants.
Johnson & Johnson and its other affiliates did not file for bankruptcy protection and will continue to operate
their businesses as usual. To demonstrate its commitment to resolving the cosmetic talc cases and remove any
financial objections to the process, Johnson & Johnson has agreed to provide funding to LTL for the payment of
amounts the Bankruptcy Court determines are owed by LTL and will also establish a $2 billion trust in furtherance
of this purpose. The $2 billion trust resulted in an incremental $1.4 billion litigation charge (recorded in Other
income & expense) in the third fiscal quarter. While LTL pursues this equitable resolution, all pending cosmetic
talc cases will be stayed. The press release further discussing this announcement is attached below as Exhibit
99.3.
