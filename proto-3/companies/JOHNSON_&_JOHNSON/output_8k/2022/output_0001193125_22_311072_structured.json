Other than with respect to these commitments, Johnson & Johnson (i) has the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to direct and control the development, marketing, commercialization and sale of the Products in all respects and (ii) is not otherwise required (expressly or implicitly) to achieve or undertake any level of efforts, or employ any level of resources, to develop, market, commercialize or sell the Products or achieve the Milestones. It is possible that none of the Milestones will be achieved, in which case holders of CVRs will not receive any payments with respect to their CVRs. It is not possible to predict whether any payment will become payable with respect to the CVRs. Whether any Milestone required for payment of any Milestone Payment is met will depend on many factors, some of which are outside the control of Johnson & Johnson and its subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that any of the Milestones will be achieved or that any payment with respect to the CVRs will be made. The foregoing description of the CVR Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the CVR Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 10.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference."

                "Transaction Financing and Cost": "The aggregate amount paid by Purchaser in the Offer and the Merger for the Shares was approximately $17.1 billion, excluding related fees and expenses. Johnson & Johnson and Purchaser funded the acquisition of the Shares in the Offer and the Merger through a combination of Johnson & Johnson’s available cash on hand and short-term financing. Johnson & Johnson estimates that it would need approximately $1.6 billion to pay the maximum aggregate amount that the holders of CVRs and holders of certain options would be entitled to if all of the Milestones are achieved.
