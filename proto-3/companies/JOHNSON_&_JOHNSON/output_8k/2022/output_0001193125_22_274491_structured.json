              "content": "On October 31, 2022, Johnson & Johnson, a New Jersey corporation ('Johnson & Johnson'), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'Merger Agreement') with Athos Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson ('Merger Sub'), and ABIOMED, Inc., a Delaware corporation ('ABIOMED').",

                "agreement_and_plan_of_merger": "Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub has agreed to commence a tender offer (the 'Offer') to acquire all outstanding shares of common stock of ABIOMED for (i) $380.00 per ABIOMED Share in cash (the 'Cash Amount'), plus (ii) one non-tradeable contingent value right per ABIOMED Share (a 'CVR'), representing the right to receive contingent payments of up to $35.00 per share. Merger Sub’s obligation to accept payment is subject to customary conditions, including: (i) a number of shares being tendered that represents at least one share more than 50% of the then-outstanding ABIOMED Shares, (ii) expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other regulatory approvals, and (iii) the absence of any legal impediment. Following the Offer, Merger Sub will merge with and into ABIOMED, with ABIOMED surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. At the effective time of the Merger, each outstanding ABIOMED Share will be converted into the right to receive the Offer Price. Each ABIOMED equity-based award will be canceled in exchange for the Cash Amount (less exercise price for options) plus one CVR. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, and covenants. ABIOMED has agreed not to solicit other acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions. The Merger Agreement has customary termination rights for both parties. If terminated under certain circumstances, including ABIOMED entering into a superior proposal, ABIOMED will be required to pay Johnson & Johnson a termination fee of $550,000,000. The boards of directors of Johnson & Johnson, Merger Sub, and ABIOMED have unanimously approved the agreement.",

CVRs will be non-transferable, subject to limited exceptions. Each CVR represents the right to receive the following milestone payments: (1) $17.50 per CVR if aggregate worldwide Net Sales of certain ABIOMED products exceed $3,700,000,000 during a specified 2028 measurement period (or $8.75 per CVR if achieved in a later 2029 period). (2) $7.50 per CVR if, on or prior to January 1, 2028, the FDA approves a premarket application for the use of any device in the Impella Product Family in patients with STEMI without cardiogenic shock. (3) $10.00 per CVR upon the earliest achievement of one of the following by December 31, 2029: publication of a Class I recommendation in the ACC/AHA Clinical Practice Guideline based on results from the STEMI DTU™ study, the PROTECT IV study, or the RECOVER IV study. Johnson & Johnson is required to expend an agreed-upon amount towards the achievement of certain milestones but is not otherwise required to undertake efforts to achieve them."

The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from the expectations and projections of ABIOMED or Johnson & Johnson. Risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to: the risk that the closing conditions for the acquisition will not be satisfied; uncertainty as to the percentage of ABIOMED stockholders that will support the proposed transaction; the possibility that the transaction will not be completed in the expected timeframe or at all; potential adverse effects to the businesses of Johnson & Johnson or ABIOMED during the pendency of the transaction; the risk of stockholder litigation; the potential that the expected benefits and opportunities of the acquisition may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected; challenges inherent in product research and development; manufacturing difficulties and delays; competition; changes to applicable laws and regulations; and trends toward health care cost containment. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022, and in subsequent filings with the SEC. Johnson & Johnson does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement."
