              "content": "On July 28, 2023, Johnson & Johnson sent a notice (the “Blackout Notice”) to its directors and executive officers informing them that, in connection with Johnson & Johnson’s offer (the “Offer”) to exchange 1,533,830,450 shares of common stock of Kenvue Inc. that it owns for outstanding shares of common stock of Johnson & Johnson (“Johnson & Johnson Shares”), a blackout period may be imposed, during which they will be subject to certain trading restrictions with respect to Johnson & Johnson Shares. The blackout period will be imposed if fifty percent or more of the participants or beneficiaries in the Johnson & Johnson Savings Plan, Johnson & Johnson Retirement Savings Plan and any other “individual account plan”, as defined in Regulation BTR (collectively, the “Plans”) direct the trustee for the applicable Plan (or its designated agent) to exchange some or all of the Johnson & Johnson Shares held in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund (through which participants may invest a portion of their Plan account balance in Johnson & Johnson Shares) attributable to their Plan accounts. The reason for the potential blackout period is that participants in the Plans who tender their Johnson & Johnson Shares will be unable, during a short period of time, to exchange or withdraw their account balances in the Johnson & Johnson Stock Fund or take certain other actions.",
