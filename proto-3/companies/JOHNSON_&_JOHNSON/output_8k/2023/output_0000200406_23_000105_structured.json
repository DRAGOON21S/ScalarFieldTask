              "content": "On November 21, 2023, the Compensation & Benefits Committee (the “Committee”) of the Board of Directors of Johnson & Johnson (the “Company”) approved the adoption of the Johnson & Johnson Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is an unfunded, nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides eligible management and other highly-compensated employees (including named executive officers) with the opportunity to defer, on a pre-tax basis, up to 50% of their base salary and up to 100% of their annual cash performance bonus to be earned in the following year. Participants will be fully vested at all times in their account within the Plan. The Plan does not provide for matching or discretionary Company contributions. Payments of deferred amounts, together with deemed investment return (positive or negative), will generally be made following a participant’s separation from service with the Company or at an earlier in-service payment date elected by the participant. The foregoing description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Plan, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and incorporated into this Current Report on Form 8-K by reference.",
