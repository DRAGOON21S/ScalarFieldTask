                "acquisition_announcement_and_eps_impact": "Today, the Company announced its acquisition of Laminar, Inc. As a result of the acquisition, Johnson & Johnson will be adjusting its expected Adjusted Fiscal Year 2023 EPS. The asset acquisition will require an in-process research and development charge which will reduce operational and reported Adjusted EPS by approximately $0.17 from guidance previously issued. The new expected operational and reported Adjusted EPS ranges are now $9.85 to $9.91 and $9.90 to $9.96, respectively. Additionally, the asset acquisition is expected to have an approximate negative $0.15 EPS impact in fiscal year 2024.",

                "cautionary_statement_regarding_forward_looking_statements": "This Current Report on Form 8-K contains forward-looking statements regarding the acquisition of Laminar, Inc. and its expected effect on our financial results. The reader is cautioned not to rely on these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on current expectations of future events. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or known or unknown risks or uncertainties materialize, actual results could vary materially from our current expectations and projections. A further list and descriptions of these risks, uncertainties and other factors can be found in Johnson & Johnson’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 1, 2023, including in the sections captioned “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” and in Johnson & Johnson’s subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Copies of these filings are available online at www.sec.gov, www.jnj.com or on request from Johnson & Johnson. Any forward-looking statement made in this release speaks only as of the date of this release. Johnson & Johnson does not undertake to update any forward-looking statement as a result of new information or future events or developments.",
                "non_gaap_financial_measures": "This Current Report on Form 8-K includes Adjusted EPS, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company believes that providing this non-GAAP financial measure enhances the Company’s and investors’ understanding of our financial performance. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s definitions of its non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The most directly comparable GAAP measure to Adjusted EPS is earnings per share, or EPS. The Company is not providing a reconciliation of Adjusted EPS to EPS, however, because Johnson & Johnson does not provide GAAP financial measures on a forward-looking basis as the Company is unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of adjusted items, such as legal proceedings, unusual gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, and purchase accounting fair value adjustments without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to Johnson & Johnson's results computed in accordance with GAAP."
