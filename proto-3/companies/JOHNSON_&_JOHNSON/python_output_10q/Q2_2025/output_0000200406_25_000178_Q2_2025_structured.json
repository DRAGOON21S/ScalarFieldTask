The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of June 29, 2025, the cumulative amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA\namounted to $ 5.2billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company\nmonitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low because the\nCompany primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit\nrating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of June 29, 2025, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 47.7billion, $ 40.9billion and $ 9.0billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2024, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps\nand interest rate swaps of $ 45.1billion, $ 40.5billion and $ 9.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other\ncomprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense\nusing the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly\neffective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly\neffective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2028 to 2055 as a net investment\nhedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of June 29, 2025, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 0.7billion after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount ultimately realized in\nearnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual\nexchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\n10\nTable of Contents\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to

The Company has elected to measure equity investments that do not have readily\ndeterminable fair values at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price\nchanges in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer.\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to equity investments:\nDecember 29,\n2024                                                  June 29, 2025\nChanges in\n(Dollars in            Carrying    Fair Value            -Sales)/               Carrying Value      Non Current\nMillions)                 Value    Reflected in          Purchases/Ot…                             Other Assets\nNet Income(1)\nEquity\nInvestments\nwith readily               $451                   -57                   59                 453              453\ndeterminable\nvalue\nEquity\nInvestments\nwithout                    $773                   -26                   76                 823              823\nreadily\ndeterminable\nvalue\n(1) Recorded in Other (income)/expense, net\n(2) Other includes impact of currency\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest\npriority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\n14\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value as of June 29, 2025 and December\n29, 2024 were as follows:\nJune 29, 2025                                            December 29, 2024\n(Dollars in Millions)                        Level 1    Level 2    Level 3    Total    Total(1)\nDerivatives designated as\nhedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange                          $—      1,006          —    1,006                         660\ncontracts\nInterest rate contracts(2)                         —        431          —      431                       1,484\nTotal                                              —      1,437          —    1,437                       2,144\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange                           —        774          —      774                         794\ncontracts\nInterest rate contracts(2)                         —      6,234          —    6,234                       3,753\nTotal                                              —      7,008          —    7,008                       4,547\nDerivatives not designated\nas hedging\ninstruments:\nAssets:\nForward foreign exchange                           —         57          —       57                          50\ncontracts\nLiabilities:\nForward foreign exchange                           —         72          —       72                          17\ncontracts\nOther Investments:\nEquity investments(3)                            453          —          —      453                         451\nDebt securities(4)                                 —      2,094          —    2,094                       7,216\nOther Liabilities:\nContingent                                        $—          —      1,157    1,157                       1,217\nconsideration(5)\nGross to Net Derivative Reconciliation    June 29, 2025    December 29, 2024\n(Dollars in Millions)\nTotal Gross Assets                               $1,494                2,194\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)                   -1,471               -2,172\nTotal Net Asset                                      23                   22\nTotal Gross Liabilities                           7,080                4,564\nCredit Support Agreement (CSA)                   -6,666               -4,412\nTotal Net Liabilities                              $414                  152\nSummarized information about changes in liabilities for contingent consideration for the fiscal second quarters\nended June 29, 2025 and June 30, 2024 is as follows:\nJune 29, 2025    June 30, 2024\n(Dollars in Millions)\nBeginning Balance                            $1,217            1,092\nChanges in estimated fair value(6)              -60               44\nAdditions                                         —              112\nPayments                                          —                —\nEnding Balance                               $1,157            1,248\n(1) 2024 assets and liabilities are all classified as Level 2 with the exception of equity investments of $\n451million, which are classified as Level 1 and contingent consideration of $ 1,217million, classified as Level 3.\n(2) Includes cross currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps.\n(3) Classified as non-current other assets.\nForm 10-Q15\nTable of Contents\n(4) Classified within cash equivalents and current marketable securities.\n(5) Includes $ 1,107million and $ 1,217million classified as non-current other liabilities as of June 29, 2025 and\nDecember 29, 2024, respectively.

     $39,235    37,376\n(1) In the fiscal first quarter of 2025, the Company issued senior unsecured notes for approximately $ 9.2billion.\nThe net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Intra-Cellular Therapies, Inc. acquisition which closed\non April 2, 2025, and for general corporate purposes.\nThe weighted average effective interest rate on non-current debt is 3.57%.\nThe excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of debt was $ 2.0billion at December 29, 2024.\nFair value of the non-current debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker\nprices and significant other observable inputs.\nThe current debt balance as of June 29, 2025, includes $ 8.5billion of commercial paper which has a weighted\naverage interest rate of 4.28% and a weighted average maturity of approximately two months.\nNote 5 — Income taxes\nThe worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal six months of 2025 and 2024 were 17.8% and 16.1%,\nrespectively.\nThe increase in the worldwide effective tax rate is primarily due to more income in higher tax jurisdictions,\nspecifically in the U.S. In the fiscal six months of 2025 the Company reversed previously accrued reserves of\napproximately $ 7.0billion for the Talc settlement proposal versus a charge of $ 3.0billion recorded in the fiscal\nsix months of 2024 for the Talc settlement proposal. Both were recorded at an effective rate for U.S. federal and\nstate tax of approximately 22% (for further information see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nAdditionally in the fiscal six months of 2025, the effective tax rate benefited primarily from changes in uncertain\ninternational tax positions due to expiration of statute of limitations.\nSubsequent to the end of the fiscal second quarter, on July 4, 2025, the United States enacted into law new tax\nlegislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, (OBBBA). The OBBBA includes provisions modifying the corporate income\ntax code, including the immediate expensing of domestic research and development expenditures for tax purposes,\n100% bonus depreciation for qualified assets, and an increase in the statutory tax rate on foreign earnings from\n10.5% to 12.6% (effective in the fiscal year 2026). The law also renamed the provision for taxes on foreign\nearnings from Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) to Net Controlled Foreign Corporation (CFC) Tested Income\n(NCTI). The Company has elected to account for GILTI, now NCTI, under the deferred method. The deferred tax amounts\nrecorded are based on the evaluation of temporary differences that are expected to reverse as NCTI is incurred in\nfuture periods. As a result, the Company will remeasure its deferred tax balances related to NCTI for the changes\nin the tax rate and will record an adjustment to this balance in the fiscal third quarter. The Company is still\nassessing this impact but is estimating this one-time re-measurement cost to be approximately $ 1.0billion.\nAs of June 29, 2025, the Company had approximately $ 2.2billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The\nCompany conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a\nnumber of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit\nfor the tax years through 2016 and the audit for tax years 2017 through 2020 is ongoing.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States.\n18\nTable of Contents\nNote 6 — Pensions and other benefit plans\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans include the\nfollowing components:\nFiscal                                               Fiscal\nSecond                                               Six\nQuarter                                              Months\nEnded                                                Ended\nRetire…                 Other                        Retire…                Other\nPlans               Benefit                          Plans               Benef…\nPlans                                               Plans\n(Doll…                June       June       June       June                June       June       June      June\nin                     29,        30,        29,        30,                 29,        30,        29,       30,\nMilli…                2025       2024       2025       2024                2025       2024       2025      2024\nServi…                $219        222         72         69                 433        446        144       138\ncost\nInter…                 356        351         53         52                 707        703        107       104\ncost\nExpec…\nreturn\non                    -599       -639         -1         -1              -1,186     -1,281         -3        -3\nplan\nassets\nAmort…\nof\nprior                  -46        -46         -1         -1                 -92        -92         -1        -1\nservi…\ncost/…\nRecog…\nactua…                  85         44         15         13                 168         87         31        26\n(gain…\nCurta…\nand                      —         -8          —          —                   —         -8          —         —\nsettl…\nSpeci…\ntermi…                   1          —          —          —                   1          —          —         —\nbenef…\nNet\nperio…                 $16        -76        138        132                  31       -145        278       264\nbenef…\ncost/…\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses.

The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $\n2.3billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $ 1.9billion, goodwill\nfor $ 0.3billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.5billion. The goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes.\nAcquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal six months of 2025 are notmaterial.\nAsset acquisitions\nThere were no material asset acquisitions in the fiscal six months of 2025 or 2024.\nDivestitures\nThere were no material divestitures in the fiscal six months of 2025.\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Acclarent resulting in approximately\n$ 0.3billion in proceeds. In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Ponvory\noutside of the U.S. resulting in approximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds.\n30\nTable of Contents\nNote 11 — Legal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of June 29, 2025, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the\nCompany and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have\nbeen verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson,\net al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the\ncase to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a\nreview of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the\naward, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the\nterms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the\nCompany. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that\nit has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain\ncircumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn an effort to expeditiously resolve the litigation for the overwhelming majority of claimants, beginning in\nOctober 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring, through which Old\nJJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were created: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited\nliability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company and a direct\nsubsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company\n(New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-related\nliabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or\ndamage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any\nproduct, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which\nthe exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nFollowing the 2021 Corporate Restructuring, Debtor and the Company attempted to achieve a full and comprehensive\nresolution of the Talc-Related Liabilities. Debtor filed voluntary petitions for Bankruptcy pursuant to Chapter 11\nof the Bankruptcy Code in October 2021 and again in April 2023; both petitions were dismissed.\nIn October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to\nachieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision;\n(ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its\ndismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative\nclaims against experts for false and defamatory narratives\nForm 10-Q31\nTable of Contents\nregarding the Company’s talc powder products. In December 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its\nname to LLT Management LLC (LLT).\nIn May 2024, the Company commenced a three-monthsolicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged”\nChapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the Proposed Plan) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and future\nclaims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer\nprotection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $ 6.475billion\npayable over 25years (nominal value of approximately $ 8.0billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The claims\nencompassed by the Proposed Plan constituted 99.75% of then-pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its\ntalc powder products.\nIn August 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited liability\ncompanies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (Red River); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (Pecos River); and (3) New Holdco (Texas)\nLLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were\nseparated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated\nto Pecos River.\nWhile the Company had resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date as of August 2024, cases continue to\nbe filed. Trials have commenced in various state courts.\nIn September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red\nRiver filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas,\nseeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the\nCompany's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Shortly thereafter, as a consequence of this filing, the Company\nwithdrew its appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision.\nTo account for the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the Company recorded a\ncumulative incremental charge of approximately $ 5.0billion during fiscal year 2024. As of the end of fiscal year\n2024, the total present value of the reserve was approximately $ 11.6billion (or nominal value of approximately $\n13.5billion).\nOn March 31, 2025, the Texas Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the case (the Texas dismissal) and, as a\nresult, the Company reversed substantially all, or approximately $ 7billion, from amounts previously reserved for\nthe bankruptcy resolution. As of the second quarter 2025, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $\n4.0billion, comprising previously executed settlement agreements, litigation defense and other costs. Approximately\none-third of the reserve is recorded as a current liability.\nAfter the Texas dismissal, the Company announced it would not appeal the decision and returned to the tort system\nto litigate the talc claims and defend the safety of its products. Courts have begun to hold scheduling conferences\nand the Company is preparing to start bellwether trials in consolidated proceedings in the California JCCP in\nNovember 2025 and in the New Jersey MCL in January 2026.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nChapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy) seeking indemnification from the Company and rights to joint insurance proceeds.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court and filed its\nDisclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan) also asserting claims for indemnity against the Company arising out\nof personal injury claims.\nIn July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent entities),\nand the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in the Imerys debtors' and\nCyprus debtors' respective Chapter 11 cases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement\nAgreement) to resolve the parties ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus\nbankruptcies. In October 2024, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Imerys Settlement\nAgreement (the Settlement Order).\nCertain insurers have appealed the Settlement Order and sought a stay of the order pending appeal, which the\nDelaware Bankruptcy Court denied in January 2025. The insurers then sought a stay of the order in the District\nCourt for the District of Delaware, which also was denied. The insurers then appealed the denial of their request\nfor a stay of the order to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The briefing of the Settlement Order appeal in the\nDelaware District Court was completed in April 2025, and the appeal is pending a decision from the Court. The\nbriefing in the Third Circuit appeal of the denial of the stay order is ongoing.\nIn January 2025, Imerys and Cyprus each filed a certification of voting results, indicating that their respective\nChapter 11 plans had been accepted by each voting class of talc claimants. A joint confirmation hearing for the\nplans began in April 2025 but was continued, at the request of Imerys and Cyprus, after issues arose relating to\ntreatment of foreign claims under their respective Chapter 11 plans.\n32\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In\nDecember 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a\npetition with the Third Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s\norder granting class certification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In\nFebruary 2024, fact discovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending\nmediation. In May 2024, the parties participated in an unsuccessful mediation. In June 2024, at the parties'\nrequest, the Court lifted the stay for certain limited discovery, but otherwise kept the stay in place pending a\ndecision from the Third Circuit on the 23(f) petition. Briefing on the 23(f) petition was completed in September\n2024, and in March 2025, the Third Circuit heard oral argument.\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and\norganizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims for up\nto $ 5.0billion. Approximately 80% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal second quarter 2025. A\nfew government entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve\nthe hospital cases.\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants. In total, there are under 27remaining opioid cases against the Company and\nJPI in various state courts, 290remaining cases in the Ohio multi-district litigation (MDL), and 2additional cases\nin other federal courts.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada. That action was certified as an opt in class action on behalf of\nother provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada in January 2025. The defendants, including the\nCompany, filed appeals from the certification order in late February 2025. Additional proposed class actions have\nbeen filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on behalf of\npeople who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed class action\nin Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against Janssen Inc.\nand other industry members in April 2024; and leave to appeal was denied in October 2024.\nStarting in November 2019, a series of shareholder derivative complaints were filed against the Company as the\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\nCompany has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. As of September 2024, all the complaints had\nbeen dismissed, and all appeals exhausted.\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each\nrelated legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to\ndefend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the\nCompany has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other\nlosses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the\nworld, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be\nrequired in the future as additional information becomes available.\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of June 29, 2025\nForm 10-Q33\nTable of Contents\nProduct or product category                          Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S                          70,030\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip                               40\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                                                860\nPelvic meshes                                                               5,350\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh                                    120\nELMIRON                                                                       920\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland,\nIndia and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers\nrepresenting ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the\nUnited States. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution\nsignificant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and\nthe settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The Company continues to receive\ninformation with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The\nCompany has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-\nrelated product liability litigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established\na United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have\nbeen settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\nAcetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nand Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The vast majority of these actions\nare now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with\nEthicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this\n34\nTable of Contents\nhernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a multi-district\nlitigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. A multi-county\nlitigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic County for cases pending\nin New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional lawsuits pending in the United\nStates District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL for polypropylene mesh devices\nmanufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed for Proceed/Proceed Ventral\nPatch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In May 2021, Ethicon and lead\ncounsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases (covering\napproximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement (MSA) was\nentered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other than a small number of cases still\npending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been resolved or are undergoing formal review\nfor purposes of settlement.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed\npending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject\nto docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon\nPhysiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nInnovative Medicine\nELMIRON\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been\nfiled in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen\nCounty, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort\ndesignation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. The Company continues to defend\nELMIRON product liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential costs related to those claims. All U.S.\nbased ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement. The Company\nhas established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability\nlitigation.\nIntellectual property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that\ncertain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these\nsubsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all\nsignificant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases\ncould adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to\nloss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash\nimpairment charge for any associated intangible asset.\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-\nForm 10-Q35\nTable of Contents\ninfringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic\nEquivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of these lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries\nare seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic version of a product before the expiration of\nthe relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the Company’s subsidiaries are not successful in an\naction, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court rulings are obtained, the generic companies\ninvolved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce generic versions of their products to the\nmarket, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for the applicable products, and\nwhich may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. In addition, from time to\ntime, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and such settlements can involve the\nintroduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to the expiration of the relevant\npatents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Pharma AG, Bayer AG and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents. The following entities are named defendants: Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc.; Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories,\nLtd.; Lupin Limited; Lupin Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Taro Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; Taro Pharmaceuticals U.S.A.,\nInc.; Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc.; Mylan Inc.; Mankind Pharma Limited; Apotex Inc.;\nApotex Corp.; Cipla Ltd.; Cipla USA Inc.; and InvaGen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The following U.S. patents are included\nin one or more cases: 9,539,218 and 10,828,310.\nU.S. Patent No. 10,828,310 was also under consideration by the USPTO in an IPR proceeding. In July 2023, the USPTO\nissued a final written decision finding the claims of the patent invalid. In September 2023, Bayer Pharma AG filed\nan appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Oral argument was heard in May 2025.\nINVEGA SUSTENNA\nBeginning in January 2018, Janssen Pharmaceutica NV and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed patent infringement\nlawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have filed ANDAs seeking approval to\nmarket generic versions of INVEGA SUSTENNA before expiration of the Orange Book Listed Patent. The following\nentities are named defendants: Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.; Mylan Laboratories Limited; Pharmascience Inc.;\nMallinckrodt PLC; Specgx LLC; Tolmar, Inc.; Accord Healthcare, Inc.; Qilu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.; and Qilu Pharma\nInc. The following U.S. patent is included in one or more cases: 9,439,906. In October 2020, the district court\nissued a decision in the case against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., finding that United States Patent No.\n9,439,906 is not invalid. Teva previously stipulated to infringement. Teva appealed the decision, and, in April\n2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the case to the district\ncourt for further proceedings. In November 2024, the district court issued its decision on remand, finding that\nUnited States Patent No. 9,439,906 is not invalid.

Strong\nsales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains and market growth. Growth of ERLEADA\n(apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth partially offset by the impact of Medicare Part D\nredesign. Increased sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains and capacity\nexpansion. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launches of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv), TALVEY (talquetamab-tgvs)\nand RYBREVANT (amivantamab)/LAZCLUZE (lazertinib) contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA\n(abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) declines due to competitive pressures\nand the impact of Medicare Part D redesign.\nImmunology products experienced an operational decline of 16.0% as compared to the same period a year ago primarily\ndue to the decline of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales driven by the impact of biosimilar competition and Medicare Part\nD redesign. The growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to share gains, market growth and launch-related inventory\ndynamics partially offset by the impact of Medicare Part D redesign. The increase in SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA sales was\nprimarily driven by the Merck, Sharp & Dohme return of rights in Europe in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024. The\nincrease in REMICADE (infliximab) sales was due to favorable patient mix, market growth, and the Merck, Sharp &\nDohme return of rights in Europe, partially offset by biosimilar competition.\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $6.7 billion in fiscal 2024. Third parties have filed\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA.\nThe Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009.\nAccording to patent settlement and license agreements, the Company expects continued launches of biosimilar\nversions of STELARA in Europe and the United States in 2025 which will impact the Company’s sales of STELARA.\nNeuroscience products, which include sales of CAPLYTA (lumateperone) acquired with the Intra-Cellular Therapies\n(Intra-Cellular) acquisition on April 2, 2025, achieved operational growth of 14.4% as compared to the same period\na year ago. Growth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by continued increased physician and patient demand.

Several\nEU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with\nother aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. While countries continue to enact new provisions or issue new\nregulations this could have an impact to the Company’s effective tax rate. The Company will continue to monitor\nfurther developments to determine any potential impact in the countries in which we operate, such as the recently\nannounced understanding between the U.S. and the G7 of a side-by-side system that would fully exclude U.S. parented\ngroups from certain provisions of the Pillar Two Framework.\nFor further details related to the fiscal 2025 provision for taxes refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAcquisitions\n(net of cash acquired)\nProceeds from the disposal of\nassets/businesses, net\nForm 10-Q53\nTable of Contents\nDividends to shareholders\nCash flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $18.6 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2025 as compared with $24.1\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2024.

(Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nIRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates\nJanssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen\nis not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader\npharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies\nremains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs,\nimplementation of the program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of\nits summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\nRussia-Ukraine war\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal second quarter of 2025, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal six months ending June 29, 2025, and the fiscal year ending December\n29, 2024, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated\nassets and represented approximately 1% of revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukrainian subsidiaries.\nIn March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare\npurposes.\nConflict in the Middle East\nAlthough the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal second quarter of 2025, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal six months ending June 29, 2025, and the fiscal year ending December\n29, 2024, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s consolidated\nassets and revenues.\nOther Macroeconomic Considerations\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency\nexchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company\noperates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey and Egypt (beginning in the\nfiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as the\n56\nTable of Contents\nprior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to\nmaintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price\nincreases.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company may be further impacted by the imposition of tariffs, trade protection measures or other policies\nadopted by any jurisdiction that favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealth care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar\nmanufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products\nprior to the expiration of the applicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the\nCompany’s patents. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the\nresulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market,\nresulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result\nin a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors\ncould launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one\nor more valid patents are in place.",

At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,\nwithin the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the\nCompany’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing\nsimilar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief\nExecutive Officer; Chairman, Executive Committee and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial\nOfficer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective.\nInternal control. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nForm 10-Q57\nTable of Contents\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions.
