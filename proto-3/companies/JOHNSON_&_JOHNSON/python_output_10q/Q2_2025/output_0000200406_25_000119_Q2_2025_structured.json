The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of March 30, 2025, the cumulative amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA\namounted to $ 1.9billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company\nmonitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low because the\nCompany primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit\nrating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of March 30, 2025, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 45.2billion, $ 40.0billion and $ 9.0billion, respectively. As of December 29, 2024, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps\nand interest rate swaps of $ 45.1billion, $ 40.5billion and $ 9.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other\ncomprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense\nusing the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly\neffective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly\neffective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2028 to 2055 as a net investment\nhedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of March 30, 2025, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 1.2billion after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount ultimately realized in\nearnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change.

Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest\npriority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position.

3.58%.\nThe excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of debt was $ 2.0billion at December 29, 2024.\nFair value of the non-current debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker\nprices and significant other observable inputs.\nThe current debt balance as of March 30, 2025, includes $ 10.9billion of commercial paper which has a weighted\naverage interest rate of 4.28% and a weighted average maturity of approximately two months.\nNote 5 — Income taxes\nThe worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 and 2024 were 19.3% and 12.4%,\nrespectively. The increase in the consolidated tax rate is primarily due to more income in higher tax\njurisdictions, specifically in the U.S. In the fiscal first quarter of 2025 the Company reversed approximately $\n7.0billion, a significant portion of the previously accrued talc reserve versus a charge of $ 2.7billion recorded\nin the fiscal first quarter of 2024 for the talc settlement proposal. Both charges were recorded at an effective\nU.S. federal and state tax rate of approximately 22% (for further information see Note 11 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\nAs of March 30, 2025, the Company had approximately $ 2.1billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The\nCompany conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a\nnumber of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit\nfor the tax years through 2016 and has commenced the audit for tax years 2017 through 2020.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States.\n16\nTabl e of Contents\nNote 6 — Pensions and other benefit plans\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans include the\nfollowing components:\nFiscal First\nQuarter Ended\nRetirement Plans                           Other Benefit\nPlans\n(Dollars in                          March 30, 2025      March 31, 2024    March 30, 2025        March 31, 2024\nMillions)\nService cost                                   $214                 224                72                    69\nInterest cost                                   351                 352                54                    52\nExpected return on                             -587                -642                -2                    -2\nplan assets\nAmortization of\nprior service                                   -46                 -46                 —                     —\ncost/(credit)\nRecognized\nactuarial                                        83                  43                16                    13\n(gains)/losses\nNet periodic\nbenefit                                         $15                 -69               140                   132\ncost/(credit)\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, and Selling, marketing and administrative expenses.

(Intra-Cellular), a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and\ncommercialization of therapeutics for central nervous system disorders. The Company acquired all the outstanding\nshares of Intra-Cellular’s common stock for $ 132.00per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $\n14.6billion. The Company funded the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and proceeds from the\nissuance of debt in the fiscal first quarter of 2025. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for\nadditional details.\nThe Company is in the process of determining the preliminary fair value of assets acquired which will primarily be\ncomprised of amortizable intangible assets and in-process research and development assets associated with CAPLYTA,\nliabilities assumed and total consideration transferred. This transaction will be accounted for as a business\ncombination and the results of operations will be included in the Innovative Medicine segment beginning on the\nacquisition date.\nBusiness combinations\nIn the fiscal first quarter of 2025, there were no material business combinations.\nOn June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix, Inc., a privately held biotechnology\ncompany focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, in an all-cash merger transaction for total\nconsideration of $ 0.8billion net of cash acquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment. The results\nof operations were included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the\nacquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 1.2billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets,\ninclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $ 0.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion, and liabilities assumed of $ 0.3billion,\nincluding $ 0.1billion of contingent consideration. The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.\nAcquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal first quarter of 2025 were notmaterial. The preliminary\npurchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period.\nOn May 31, 2024, the Company acquired all the outstanding shares of Shockwave Medical Inc. a leading, first-to-\nmarket provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the treatment of calcified coronary\nartery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), in an all-cash merger transaction for total consideration\nof $ 11.5billion, net of cash acquired. The results of operations were included in the MedTech segment as of the\nacquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 14.4billion primarily\namortizable intangible assets of $ 5.3billion, purchased IPR&D of $ 0.6billion, goodwill for $ 7.6billion, $\n0.5billion of inventory and $ 0.4billion of other assets, and liabilities assumed of $ 2.9billion. The goodwill is\nnot expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any\nsubsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal\nfirst quarter of 2025 were $ 0.1billion, primarily related to the fair value of the inventory step-up and were\nrecorded in Cost of products sold.\nOn March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a clinical-stage\nbiopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-\ngeneration antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total consideration of\napproximately $ 1.8billion net of cash acquired. The results of operations were included in the Innovative Medicine\nsegment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $\n2.3billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $ 1.9billion, goodwill\nfor $ 0.3billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.5billion, which includes deferred taxes of $ 0.4billion. The\ngoodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal first quarter of\n2025 were notmaterial.\nAsset acquisitions\nIn the fiscal first quarters of 2025 and 2024, there were no material asset acquisitions.\nDivestitures\nIn the fiscal first quarter of 2025, there were no material divestitures.\nIn the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Ponvory outside of the U.S. resulting\nin approximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds.\n26\nTabl e of Contents\nNote 11 — Legal proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of March 30, 2025, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the\nCompany and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have\nbeen verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson,\net al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the\ncase to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a\nreview of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the\naward, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the\nterms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the\nCompany. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that\nit has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain\ncircumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the\nMississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’\nuse of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The\nCompany has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its\ntalcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group\nof state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements\nwere finalized.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and three new entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old\nForm 10-Q27\nTabl e of Contents\nJJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or\nincurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk\nof, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is\nprovided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against\nLTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance\ncompanies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to\nthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL\nBankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in\nMarch 2022.\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\nBankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case.\nIn April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy\nCase). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to\nsection 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining\norder staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other\nparties (the New Protected Parties).\nAlso in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the\nCompany and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained\nin force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary\nInjunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for those cases filed in the federal court\novarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted\nto proceed.\nFurthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case\nfollowed by similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July\n2023, the court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the\ndecision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October\n2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. In July 2024, the Third Circuit issued a non-\nprecedential opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case.\nIn October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to\nachieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision;\n(ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its\ndismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative\nclaims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products. In\nDecember 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC (LLT).\nFollowing the dismissal of the LTL 2 Bankruptcy Case, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had\nbeen stayed were reactivated, and trials commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court,\norganized in a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey.\nIn the MDL, case-specific discovery proceeded. The MDL proceedings were stayed by order of the bankruptcy court in\nthe Red River Bankruptcy case discussed below. In March 2024, the court granted the Company's motion for a renewed\nDaubert hearing prior to the trial. The briefing on the renewed Daubert issues was completed in August 2024.\nIn May 2024, the Company commenced a three-monthsolicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged”\nChapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the Proposed Plan) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and future\nclaims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer\nprotection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $ 6.475billion\npayable over 25years (nominal value of approximately $ 8.0billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The claims\nencompassed by the Proposed Plan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its talc\npowder products.\nIn August 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited liability\ncompanies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (Red River); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (Pecos River); and (3) New Holdco (Texas)\nLLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological cancers were\nseparated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims were allocated\nto Pecos River.\n28\nTabl e of Contents\nIn September 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red\nRiver filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas,\nseeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the\nCompany's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Red River also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,\nseeking to extend the automatic stay to additional non-debtor entities.\nShortly after Red River filed its Chapter 11 petition, the U.S. Trustee's office filed a motion to transfer venue\nin the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter, a motion to transfer venue and a motion to dismiss in the Texas\nBankruptcy Court. A coalition of six plaintiff law firms also filed a motion to transfer venue and a motion to\ndismiss in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. In September 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary order\nenjoining the commencement or prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities,\nincluding the Company, until October 11, 2024 (the Stay Order). The Stay Order was extended in October 2024,\nDecember 2024, and on March 13, 2025. Also in September 2024, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied the U.S.\nTrustee's motion to transfer venue without prejudice. In October 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court denied the motion\nto transfer venue from Texas to New Jersey Bankruptcy Court. A consolidated hearing to address, among other things,\nthe motions to dismiss and plan confirmation began on February 18, 2025 and concluded on February 28, 2025.\nTo account for the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the Company recorded a\ncumulative incremental charge of approximately $ 5.0billion during fiscal year 2024. As of the end of fiscal year\n2024, the total present value of the reserve was approximately $ 11.6billion (or nominal value of approximately $\n13.5billion). On March 31, 2025, the Texas Bankruptcy Court issued an order dismissing the case and, as a result,\nthe Company reversed substantially all, or approximately $ 7billion, from amounts previously reserved for the\nbankruptcy resolution. Further, as a result of the dismissal, the Stay Order was dissolved. On April 1, 2025, the\nCompany provided notice to the MDL court that the pending Daubert motion should proceed.\nWhile the Company has resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date, cases continue to be filed. Trials\nhave commenced in various state courts. As of the first quarter 2025, the total present value of the reserve is\napproximately $ 4.2billion, comprising previously executed settlement arrangements, litigation defense and other\ncosts. Approximately one-third of the reserve is recorded as a current liability.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nChapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury\nfrom exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company\nfor indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a Chapter 11 plan\n(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its\nalleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust\nwould pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification\nfrom the Company.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Delaware Bankruptcy Court and filed its\nDisclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus Plan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc\nclaimants where Cyprus would make a monetary contribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange\nfor an injunction against talc claims asserted against it and certain affiliated parties. Cyprus also asserts it\nhas claims for indemnity against the Company arising out of talc personal injury claims. Under the Cyprus Plan,\nCyprus would also contribute its alleged indemnification rights to the trust.\nIn September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar\nconstruct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain\nother protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights\nagainst the Company. The Company opposed both plans on the basis that the plans inflated Imerys’s and Cyprus’s\nliability for talc claims and had the potential effect of imposing those inflated liabilities on the Company\nthrough the Company’s alleged indemnification obligations.\nIn July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent entities),\nand the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in the Imerys debtors' and\nCyprus debtors' respective Chapter 11 cases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement\nAgreement) to resolve the parties ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus\nbankruptcies. Under the global settlement, the Company and its affiliates, on the one hand, and Imerys and Cyprus\nand their respective affiliates, on the other hand, release their claims against one another arising out of talc\nclaims, including indemnification and contribution claims. In addition, under the settlement, the Company purchased\nthe Imerys and Cyprus debtors' indemnification rights against the Company free and clear of all claims and interest\n(the Indemnity Buyback). In August 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended Chapter 11 plans and disclosure statements\nincorporating the terms of the settlement with the Company. In October 2024, the Delaware Bankruptcy Court entered\nan order approving the Imerys Settlement Agreement (the Settlement Order). The effectiveness of certain provisions\nof the settlement, including the mutual\nForm 10-Q29\nTabl e of Contents\nreleases, and Indemnity Buyback, were subject to certain conditions, which have since been satisfied. Accordingly,\nthe mutual releases and Indemnity Buyback are now in effect.\nCertain insurers have appealed the Settlement Order and sought a stay of the order pending appeal, which the\nDelaware Bankruptcy Court denied on January 13, 2025. The insurers then sought a stay of the order in the District\nCourt for the District of Delaware, which also was denied. The insurers then appealed the denial of their request\nfor a stay of the order to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. The briefing of the Settlement Order appeal in the\nDelaware District Court is scheduled to be completed in April 2025.\nOn January 5, 2025, Imerys and Cyprus each filed a certification of voting results, indicating that their\nrespective Chapter 11 plans had been accepted by each voting class of talc claimants. A joint confirmation hearing\nfor the plans is scheduled for April 2025.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. The\ncase was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the\nCourt granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the\nThird Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class\ncertification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In February 2024, fact\ndiscovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending mediation. In May 2024, the\nparties participated in an unsuccessful mediation. In June 2024, at the parties' request, the Court lifted the stay\nfor certain limited discovery, but otherwise kept the stay in place pending a decision from the Third Circuit on\nthe 23(f) petition. Briefing on the 23(f) petition was completed in September 2024, and in March 2025, the Third\nCircuit heard oral argument.\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and\norganizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle the state and subdivision claims for up\nto $ 5.0billion. Approximately 70% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal first quarter 2025. A few\ngovernment entities opted out of the settlement. In September 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve the\nhospital cases.\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants. In total, there are under 35remaining opioid cases against the Company and\nJPI in various state courts, 325remaining cases in the Ohio multi-district litigation (MDL), and 3additional cases\nin other federal courts.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada. That action was certified as an opt in class action on behalf of\nother provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada in January 2025. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on\nbehalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed\nclass action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against\nJanssen Inc. and other industry members in April 2024; and leave to appeal was denied in October 2024. The\ndefendants including the Company filed appeals from the certification order in late February 2025.\nStarting in November 2019, a series of shareholder derivative complaints were filed against the Company as the\nnominal defendant and certain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New\nJersey. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the\nCompany has suffered damages as a result of those alleged breaches. As of September 2024, all the complaints had\nbeen dismissed, and all appeals exhausted.\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued\n30\nTabl e of Contents\nfor these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted\nbased on new information and further developments in accordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company\naccrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can\nbe reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the Company has accrued additional amounts such as estimated\ncosts associated with settlements, damages and other losses. Product liability accruals can represent projected\nproduct liability for thousands of claims around the world, each in different litigation environments and with\ndifferent fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be required in the future as additional information becomes\navailable.\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of March 30, 2025:\nProduct or product category                          Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S                          62,850\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip                               50\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                                                910\nPelvic meshes                                                               5,910\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh                                    140\nELMIRON                                                                     1,140\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and ASR Hip Resurfacing System\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Ireland,\nIndia and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed committee of lawyers\nrepresenting ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip patients in the\nUnited States. This settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution\nsignificant ASR Hip litigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and\nthe settlement program does not address litigation outside of the United States. The Company continues to receive\ninformation with respect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The\nCompany has established accruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-\nrelated product liability litigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established\na United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have\nbeen settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\nAcetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally\nForm 10-Q31\nTabl e of Contents\nfiled and additional pelvic mesh lawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled\nor otherwise resolved the majority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these\nsettlements and the remaining cases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and\nindividual personal injury cases or claims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh\ndevices have been commenced in various countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the\nUnited Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The\nvast majority of these actions are now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to product\nliability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed\nfor Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In\nMay 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately\n3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master\nsettlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other\nthan a small number of cases still pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been\nresolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed\npending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject\nto docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon\nPhysiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nInnovative Medicine\nELMIRON\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been\nfiled in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen\nCounty, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort\ndesignation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. The Company continues to defend\nELMIRON product liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential costs related to those claims. All U.S.\nbased ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement. The Company\nhas established accruals for defense and indemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability\nlitigation.\nIntellectual property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the scope and/\n32\nTabl e of Contents\nor validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that certain of the Company’s products\ninfringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these subsidiaries believe that they have\nsubstantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all significant patents, there can be no\nassurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases could adversely affect the ability of\nthese subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to loss of market exclusivity, require the\npayment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment charge for any associated\nintangible asset.\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication\n“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of\nthese lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic\nversion of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court\nrulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce\ngeneric versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and\nrevenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\nintangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and\nsuch settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to\nthe expiration of the relevant patents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bayer Pharma AG, Bayer AG and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents.

Ltd.; and Qilu Pharma\nInc. The following U.S. patent is included in one or more cases: 9,439,906. In October 2020, the district court\nissued a decision in the case against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc., finding that United States Patent No.\n9,439,906 is not invalid. Teva previously stipulated to infringement. Teva appealed the decision, and, in April\n2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated and remanded the case to the district\ncourt for further proceedings. In November 2024, the district court issued its decision on remand, finding that\nUnited States Patent No. 9,439,906 is not invalid.

In addition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing\nbasis and from time to time may raise capital when market conditions are favorable.\nSubsequent to March 30, 2025, the Company paid approximately $3.0 billion to the U.S. Treasury, including $2.5\nbillion related to the final installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge (see Note\n1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended\nDecember 29, 2024) and $0.5 billion primarily\n46\nTabl e of Contents\nrelated to the normal estimated payment for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. Additionally, the Company has paid\n$0.6 billion in income related taxes net of refunds in foreign jurisdictions in the first three months of fiscal\n2025.\nDividends\nOn January 2, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on March 4,\n2025, to shareholders of record as of February 18, 2025.\nOn April 15, 2025, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.30 per share, payable on June 10,\n2025, to shareholders of record as of May 27, 2025. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying regular\nquarterly cash dividends.\nOther information\nNew accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.\nEconomic and market factors\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nIRA's Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that the IRA violates\nJanssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and therefore that Janssen\nis not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. The impact of the IRA on our business and the broader\npharmaceutical industry remains uncertain, as litigation filed by Janssen and other pharmaceutical companies\nremains ongoing and while CMS has publicly announced the maximum fair price for each of the selected drugs,\nimplementation of the program is still in progress. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the district court’s denial of\nits summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\nRussia-Ukraine war\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal three months ending March 30, 2025, and the fiscal year ending\nDecember 29, 2024, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of the Company’s\nconsolidated assets and represented approximately 1% of revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukrainian\nsubsidiaries.\nIn March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare\npurposes.\nConflict in the Middle East\nAlthough the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2025, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal three months ending March 30, 2025, and the fiscal year ending\nDecember 29, 2024, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s\nconsolidated assets and revenues.\nOther Macroeconomic Considerations\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency\nexchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company\noperates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey and Egypt (beginning in the\nfiscal fourth quarter of 2024) as highly inflationary, as the prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed\n100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives to maintain its profit margins through cost reduction\nprograms, productivity improvements and periodic price increases.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries.\nForm 10-Q47\nTabl e of Contents\nA change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in the revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets\nand liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the period in which the new tax law is enacted. This\nchange would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The\nCompany closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the countries where it operates. Changes to the statutory\ntax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or benefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter\nand year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company may be further impacted by the imposition of tariffs, trade protection measures or other policies\nadopted by any jurisdiction that favor domestic companies and technologies over foreign competitors.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealth care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, may continue to impact the Company’s businesses.\nThe Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar\nmanufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products\nprior to the expiration of the applicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the\nCompany’s patents. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the\nresulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market,\nresulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result\nin a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors\ncould launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one\nor more valid patents are in place.",

At the end of the period covered by this report, the Company evaluated the\neffectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures. The Company’s disclosure\ncontrols and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the\nreports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported,\nwithin the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without\nlimitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in\nthe reports that it files or submits under the Securities Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the\nCompany’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing\nsimilar functions, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Joaquin Duato, Chief\nExecutive Officer; Chairman, Executive Committee and Joseph J. Wolk, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial\nOfficer, reviewed and participated in this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, Messrs. Duato and Wolk concluded\nthat, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were\neffective.\nInternal control. During the period covered by this report, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control\nover financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. The Company continues to monitor and assess the effectiveness\nof the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures.\nThe Company is implementing a multi-year, enterprise-wide initiative to integrate, simplify and standardize\nprocesses and systems for the human resources, information technology, procurement, supply chain and finance\nfunctions. These are enhancements to support the growth of the Company’s financial shared service capabilities and\nstandardize financial systems. This initiative is not in response to any identified deficiency or weakness in the\nCompany’s internal control over financial reporting. In response to this initiative, the Company has and will\ncontinue to align and streamline the design and operation of its financial control environment.\n48\nTabl e of Contents",
