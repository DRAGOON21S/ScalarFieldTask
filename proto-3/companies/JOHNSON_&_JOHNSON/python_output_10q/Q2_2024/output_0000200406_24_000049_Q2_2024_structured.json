The unaudited interim financial statements include all adjustments (consisting only of normal\nrecurring adjustments) and accruals necessary in the judgment of management for a fair statement of the results for\nthe periods presented.\nColumns and rows within tables may not add due to rounding. Percentages have been calculated using actual, non-\nrounded figures.\nNew accounting standards\nThe Company assesses the adoption impacts of recently issued accounting standards by the Financial Accounting\nStandards Board on the Company's financial statements as well as material updates to previous assessments, if any,\nfrom the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecently adopted accounting standards\nThere were no new material accounting standards adopted in the fiscal first quarter of 2024.\nRecently issued accounting standards\nNot adopted as of March 31, 2024\nASU 2023-07: Segment Reporting (Topic 280) – Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures\nThis update requires expanded annual and interim disclosures for significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to the chief operating decision maker and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss.\nThis update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods within fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2024. This standard is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented in\nthe financial statements. Early adoption is permitted. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it\nwill not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nASU 2023-09: Income Taxes (Topic 740) - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\nThis update standardizes categories for the effective tax rate reconciliation, requires disaggregation of income\ntaxes and additional income tax-related disclosures. This update is required to be effective for the Company for\nfiscal periods beginning after December 15, 2024. As this accounting standard only impacts disclosures, it will not\nhave a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThere were no new material accounting standards issued in the fiscal first quarter of 2024.\nSupplier finance program obligations\nThe Company has agreements for supplier finance programs with third-party financial institutions. These programs\nprovide participating suppliers the ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company is not a party to the arrangements between the suppliers and the third-party\nfinancial institutions. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due, and scheduled payment\ndates (which have general payment terms of 90days), are not affected by a participating supplier’s decision to\nparticipate in the program.\nAs of March 31, 2024, and December 31, 2023, $ 0.6billion and $ 0.7billion, respectively, were valid obligations\nunder the program.

The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of March 31, 2024, the cumulative amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA\namounted to $ 2.2billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company\nmonitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low, because the\nCompany primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit\nrating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of March 31, 2024, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 43.2billion, $ 39.6billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps\nand interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other\ncomprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense\nusing the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly\neffective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly\neffective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2024 to 2035 as a net investment\nhedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 795million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount ultimately realized in\nearnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual\nexchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\nForm 10-Q9\nTable of Contents\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related to

Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest\npriority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\n12\nTable of

The change in the consolidated tax rate as compared to the prior year fiscal first quarter is\nprimarily due to a charge of $ 6.9billion in the fiscal first quarter of 2023 and a charge of $ 2.7billion in the\nfiscal first quarter of 2024, both for the talc settlement proposal. Both charges were recorded at an effective\nU.S. federal and state tax rate of approximately 23% (for further information see Note 11 to the Consolidated\nFinancial Statements).\nAdditionally in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the effective tax rate was impacted by legislative changes that\nwent into effect for Pillar Two in some of the Company's foreign jurisdictions. The Company also had tax benefits\nreceived from stock-based compensation that were either exercised or vested during each of the fiscal first\nquarters, as well as a capital loss tax benefit in the fiscal first quarter of 2024.\nAs of March 31, 2024, the Company had approximately $ 2.5billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The\nCompany conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a\nnumber of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service has completed its audit\nfor the tax years through 2016 and in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 has commenced the audit for tax years 2017\nthrough 2020.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to\nprovide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax\npositions.\nNote 6 — Pensions and other benefit plans\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans include the\nfollowing components:\nFiscal First\nQuarter Ended\nRetirement Plans                           Other Benefit\nPlans\n(Dollars in                          March 31, 2024       April 2, 2023    March 31, 2024         April 2, 2023\nMillions)\nService cost                                   $224                 210                69                    68\nInterest cost                                   352                 352                52                    54\nExpected return on                             -642                -668                -2                    -1\nplan assets\nAmortization of\nprior service                                   -46                 -46                 —                     —\ncost/(credit)\nRecognized\nactuarial                                        43                 -50                13                     6\n(gains)/losses\nCurtailments and                                  —                   —                 —                     —\nsettlements\nNet periodic\nbenefit                                       $(69)                -202               132                   127\ncost/(credit)\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and in the fiscal first quarter\nof 2023, Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation of Kenvue.

2024, the Company announced that it has entered into a definitive\nagreement to acquire all outstanding shares of Shockwave Medical, Inc. (Shockwave) (Nasdaq: SWAV), a leading,\nfirst-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the treatment of calcified\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD), for $ 335.00per share in cash, corresponding to\nan enterprise value of approximately $ 13.1billion including cash acquired. The results of operations will be\nincluded in the MedTech segment as of the acquisition date. The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by\nmid–year 2024.\nOn March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a clinical-stage\nbiopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and develop next-\ngeneration antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total equity value of\napproximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.8billion net of cash acquired. The Company acquired all of the outstanding\nshares of Ambrx’s common stock for $ 28.00per share through a merger of Ambrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The\ntransaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations were included in the\nInnovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets\nacquired of $ 2.3billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $\n1.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.5billion, which includes deferred taxes of $\n0.4billion. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the\nmeasurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 40% to 70% was used in the fair value calculation\nto reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 17%.\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not\nexpected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal first quarter of\n2024 were not material.\nDivestitures\nIn the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Ponvory resulting in approximately $\n0.2billion in proceeds.\nThere were no material acquisitions or divestitures in the fiscal first quarter of 2023.\nNote 11 — Legal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of March 31, 2024, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against Johnson\n& Johnson Consumer Inc., its successor LTL Management LLC (now known as LLT Management LLC) and the Company arising\nout of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nForm 10-Q25\nTable of Contents\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have\nbeen verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson,\net al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the\ncase to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a\nreview of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the\naward, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the\nterms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the\nCompany. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that\nit has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain\ncircumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and threenew entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against\nLTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance\ncompanies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to\nthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL\nBankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in\nMarch 2022.\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\nBankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\nIn April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy\nCase). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to\nsection 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining\norder staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other\nparties (the New Protected Parties).\nAlso in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the\nCompany and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained\nin force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary\nInjunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for in those cases filed in the federal\ncourt ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was\npermitted to proceed.\nFurthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed\nby similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023,\nthe court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the\ndecision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October\n2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. Briefing is ongoing.\nIn October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to\nachieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision;\n(ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its\ndismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative\nclaims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products.\nFollowing the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were\nreactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a\nmulti-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL,\ncase-specific discovery is proceeding with an expectation that a trial will occur in early 2025. In March 2024, the\ncourt granted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert hearing and set a briefing schedule.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company commenced a three-month solicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged”\nchapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the “Proposed Plan”) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and\nfuture claims related to\n26\nTable of Contents\ncosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State consumer protection claims,\nin exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $ 6.475billion payable over 25years\n(nominal value of approximately $ 8.4billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The claims encompassed by the Proposed\nPlan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its talc powder products. Mesothelioma\nand State consumer protection claims are being addressed outside the Proposed Plan. The Company separately has\nresolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date, and has agreements in principle to resolve the State\nclaims.\nTo account for these settlements and the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the\nCompany recorded an incremental charge of approximately $ 2.7billion, for a total reserve as of the first fiscal\nquarter 2024 at a present value of approximately $ 11billion (or nominal value of approximately $ 13.7billion).\nApproximately one-third of the reserve is recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the\nCompany's best estimate of probable loss.\nDuring the pendency of the solicitation period, the Company will continue to pursue in parallel the other three\npreviously-announced pathways to resolve the talc claims, including proceeding with the Daubert motions in the MDL.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nchapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury\nfrom exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company\nfor indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan\n(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its\nalleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust\nwould pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification\nfrom the Company.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus\nPlan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary\ncontribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims\nasserted against it and certain affiliated parties.\nThe Imerys Plan proceeded to solicitation in early 2021. However, the Imerys Plan did not receive the requisite\nnumber of votes to be confirmed after the Bankruptcy Court ruled certain votes cast in favor of the Imerys Plan\nshould be disregarded. Imerys subsequently canceled its confirmation hearing.\nAfter the confirmation hearing was canceled, Imerys, the Imerys Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Imerys Future\nClaimants’ Representative, along with Cyprus, the Cyprus Tort Claimants’ Committee, and the Cyprus Future\nClaimants’ Representative engaged in mediation. The Bankruptcy Court also authorized Imerys and Cyprus to proceed\nwith mediation with certain of their insurers.\nIn September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar\nconstruct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain\nother protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights\nagainst the Company. In January 2024, Imerys and Cyprus each filed a disclosure statement for its respective\nChapter 11 plans. On April 29, 2024, the Company, Imerys and Cyprus reached an agreement in principle on monetary\nand non-monetary terms to resolve their ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus\nbankruptcies.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In\nApril 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. The case was stayed in May 2022\npursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s\nmotion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class certification, and in\nFebruary 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. Fact discovery closed in February 2024 and the Court\nordered the parties to mediate. The Court stayed the case pending the mediation, which is scheduled for May 2024.\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\nthe plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings. In\nJuly 2019, the Company filed a notice of removal to the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nCalifornia and plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint shortly thereafter. In October 2019, the Company moved\nto dismiss the second amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In response\nto those motions, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint. In December 2019, the Company moved to dismiss the\nthird amended complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. In April 2020, the Court\ngranted the motion to dismiss but granted leave to amend. In May 2020, plaintiffs filed a Fourth Amended Complaint\nbut indicated that they would be filing a motion for leave to file a fifth amended complaint. Plaintiffs filed a\nFifth Amended Complaint in August 2020. The Company moved to dismiss the Fifth Amended Complaint for failure to\nstate a claim upon which relief may be granted. In January 2021, the Court issued an Order and opinion ruling in\nthe Company’s favor and granting the motion to dismiss\nForm 10-Q27\nTable of Contents\nwith prejudice. In February 2021, Plaintiffs filed a Notice of Appeal with the Ninth Circuit. Plaintiffs filed\ntheir opening brief in July 2021. The company filed its responsive brief in October 2021. After the Notice of\nSuggestion of Bankruptcy was filed with the Ninth Circuit, a stay was imposed, and the Court held the reply\ndeadline in abeyance. In September 2023, the stay lifted. On April 29, 2024, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the\nDistrict Court's order dismissing the case with prejudice.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint in Chancery Court of The First Judicial District\nof Hinds County, Mississippi against the Company and Johnson & Johnson Consumer Companies, Inc. (now known as\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc.) (collectively, JJCI). The complaint alleges that JJCI violated the Mississippi\nConsumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’ use of talc\ncontained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012) and seeks injunctive\nand monetary relief. In February 2022, the trial court set the case for trial to begin in February 2023. However,\nin October 2022, the LTL bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued\nthe mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL\nBankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as to this matter. The State requested a new trial setting. Later in\nApril 2023, the trial court set a new trial date for April 2024. The Company filed summary judgment and Daubert\nmotions. The State filed a limited Daubert motion. The parties agreed to the Court's request for mediation. The\nCompany has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. In March 2022, the New Mexico court denied the Company’s motion to\ncompel the State of New Mexico to engage in discovery of state agencies and denied the Company’s request for\ninterlocutory appeal of that decision. The Company then filed a Petition for Writ of Superintending Control and a\nRequest for a Stay to the New Mexico Supreme Court on the issue of the State of New Mexico’s discovery obligations.\nIn April 2022, in view of the efforts to resolve talc-related claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case, the Company and\nthe State agreed to a 60-day stay of all matters except for the pending writ before the New Mexico Supreme Court,\nwhich expired in June 2022. Thereafter, the Company moved to enjoin prosecution of the case in the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase. In October 2022, the bankruptcy court issued an order staying the case. In December 2022, the State filed an\nappeal to the Third Circuit concerning the stay order. Separately, in September 2022, the New Mexico Supreme Court\ngranted the Company's request for a stay pending further briefing on the scope of the State of New Mexico’s\ndiscovery obligations. In March 2023, the Third Circuit issued the mandate to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy Case and\nin April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto this matter. While the State notified the New Mexico Supreme Court of the lifted stay of litigation in April\n2023, the Court has not taken any action since being notified of the lifting of the stay and it remains in effect.\nThe Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia (including Mississippi and New Mexico) have commenced a joint\ninvestigation into the Company’s marketing of its talcum powder products. At this time, the multi-state group has\nnot asserted any claims against the Company. Five states have issued Civil Investigative Demands seeking documents\nand other information. The Company has produced documents to Arizona, North Carolina, Texas, and Washington and\nentered into confidentiality agreements. The Company has not received any follow up requests from those states. In\nMarch 2022, each of the forty-two states agreed to mediation of their claims in the LTL Bankruptcy Case. In July\n2022, New Mexico and Mississippi indicated they would no longer voluntarily submit to further mediation in the LTL\nBankruptcy and would proceed with their respective cases in state court. In March 2023, the mediation was\nterminated. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group of state\nAttorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. The unique procedural history and status\nof the New Mexico and Mississippi matters specifically have been discussed above.\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc\nmatters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and\nresponded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases were filed by state and local governments,\nwhich were subject to a final settlement in 2021. As of January 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or otherwise\nresolved the opioid claims advanced by all government entity claimants except the City of Baltimore, a number of\nschool districts, and other claimants. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and\norganizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle all remaining state and subdivision\nclaims for up to $ 5.0billion. Approximately 60% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal first\nquarter 2024, and will increase to approximately 75% by fiscal year end 2024.\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, hospitals, and health insurers/payors. Counting\nthe private litigant cases, there are approximately 35remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various\nstate courts, 435remaining cases in the Ohio MDL, and 4additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these\ncases have been dismissed and are being appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in\n2024, 2025, or 2026.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class\naction on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on\nbehalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. These actions\nallege a variety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition,\npublic nuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. An\nadverse judgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and\nsignificant damages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other\nsanctions.\nIn November 2019, a shareholder filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the nominal defendant and\ncertain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint\nalleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages\nas a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations\nagainst the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By\n2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted the\nCompany’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice\nof dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed appealed the state court’s dismissal order, and\nbriefing on the appeal concluded in October 2022. In February 2024, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of\nthe shareholder's amended complaint. In March 2024, the shareholder filed a notice of petition for certification\nwith the Supreme Court of New Jersey seeking review of the appellate court's decision.\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each\nrelated legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to\ndefend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the\nCompany has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other\nlosses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the\nworld, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be\nrequired in the future as additional information becomes available.\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of March 31, 2024:\nProduct or product category                          Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S                          61,490\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip                              160\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                                                920\nPelvic meshes                                                               6,440\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh                                    230\nRISPERDAL                                                                      50\nELMIRON                                                                     2,150\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nForm 10-Q29\nTable of Contents\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL acetabular system and ASR Hip resurfacing system\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established\naccruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability\nlitigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established\na United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have\nbeen settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\nAcetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nBelgium, France, Ireland, Italy, Spain and Slovenia and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South\nAfrica. The vast majority of these actions are now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to\nproduct liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed\nfor Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In\nMay 2021, Ethicon\n30\nTable of Contents\nand lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately 3,600Physiomesh cases\n(covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master settlement agreement\n(MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other than a small number of\ncases still pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been resolved or are undergoing\nformal review for purposes of settlement.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed\npending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject\nto docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon\nPhysiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nInnovative Medicine\nRISPERDAL\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the\nuse of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. The Company continues to defend RISPERDAL product liability lawsuits, and continues to\nevaluate potential costs related to those claims. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but\nthere have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive\ndamages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021,\nthe Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in\nsubstantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other\nsettlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\nELMIRON\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been\nfiled in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen\nCounty, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort\ndesignation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. The Company continues to defend\nELMIRON product liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential costs related to those claims. Other than a\nsmall number of cases in the MDL filed by one law firm, all U.S. based ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are\nundergoing formal review for purposes of settlement. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity\ncosts associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.\nIntellectual Property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that\ncertain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these\nsubsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all\nsignificant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases\ncould adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to\nloss of market\nForm 10-Q31\nTable of Contents\nexclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash impairment\ncharge for any associated intangible asset.\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication\n“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of\nthese lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic\nversion of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court\nrulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce\ngeneric versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and\nrevenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\nintangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and\nsuch settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to\nthe expiration of the relevant patents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents.

Sales of STELARA\n(ustekinumab) were driven by market growth and share gains in Inflammatory Bowel Disease partially offset by\nunfavorable patient mix. Growth of TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains. Additionally,\nSIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA growth was driven by growth outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to\nbiosimilar competition.\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA.\nThe Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a\nresult of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the\nlaunch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States. The latest expiring European\ncomposition of matter patent (Supplementary Protection Certificate) expires in 2024 in most European Union Member\nStates and the United Kingdom.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nInfectious disease products experienced an operational decline of 48.3% as compared to the same period a year ago\nprimarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue. The Company expects an insignificant amount of COVID-19\nvaccine revenue in fiscal 2024.\nNeuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 2.2% as compared to the same period a year ago. The\ngrowth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by increased physician and patient demand. Growth was partially offset\nby declines in RISPERDAL CONSTA.\nOncology products achieved operational sales growth of 18.8% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong\nsales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions. Growth of ERLEADA\n(apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth. Increased sales of CARVYKTI (ciltacabtagene\nautoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally,\nsales from the ongoing launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and the launch of TALVEY (talquetamab) and RYBREVANT\n(amivantamab) in Other Oncology contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone\nacetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) declines due to global competitive pressures.\nPulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 22.4% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales\ngrowth was due to favorable patient mix, market growth and share gains from UPTRAVI (selexipag) and OPSUMIT\n(macitentan).\nCardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 10.5% as compared to the same\nperiod a year ago. The decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and\nshare loss.\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B\ncovered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee\ncovered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been\nand will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it\nbelieves its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited\nby the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug\nmanufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities.\n40\nTable of Contents\nMedTech\nThe MedTech segment sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 were $7.8 billion, an increase of 4.5% as compared to\nthe same period a year ago, which included operational growth of 6.3% and a negative currency impact of 1.8%.

The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for\nthe fiscal first quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:\nOne-time COVID-19 Vaccine related exit costs of $0.4 billion in 2023\nFavorable patient mix in Cost of products sold\npartially offset by\nAn increase in brand marketing investment\nHigher administrative costs\nHigher investments in research and development\nMedTech segment\nThe MedTech segment income before tax as a percent of sales in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 was 19.4% versus\n18.8% for the same period a year ago. The increase in the income before tax as a percent of sales for the fiscal\nfirst quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior year was primarily driven by the following:\nAn IPR&D charge in 2023 of approximately $0.1 billion related to the Pulsar Vascular acquisition in the fiscal\nyear 2016\nResearch and development expense phasing\npartially offset by\nMacroeconomic factors and unfavorable currency in Cost of products sold\nRestructuring\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Company completed a prioritization of its research and development (R&D) investment\nwithin the Innovative Medicine segment to focus on the most promising medicines with the greatest benefit to\npatients. This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&D program exits are\nprimarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1\nbillion in both the fiscal first quarters of 2024 and 2023, included the termination of partnered and non-partnered\nprogram costs and asset impairments. Total project costs of approximately $0.6 billion have been recorded since the\nrestructuring was announced.\nIn the fiscal year 2023, the Company initiated a restructuring program of its Orthopaedics franchise within its\nMedTech segment to streamline operations by exiting certain markets, product lines and distribution network\narrangements. The pre-tax restructuring expense of $27 million in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, of which $20\nmillion was recorded in Restructuring and $7 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings, primarily included costs related to market and product exits. Total project costs of\napproximately $0.3 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.\nForm 10-Q45\nTable of Contents\nProvision for taxes on income\nThe worldwide effective income tax rate for the fiscal three months was 12.4% in 2024 and 61.8% in 2023.\nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which\ngenerally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. Several\nEU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation with an initial effective date of January 1, 2024, with\nother aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that as result of this legislation\nthe 2024 effective tax rate will increase by 1.5% (150 basis points) compared to fiscal 2023. Further legislation,\nguidance and regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well as other business events, may impact this\nestimate.\nFor further details related to the 2024 provision for taxes refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAcquisitions\n(net of cash acquired)\nProceeds from the disposal of\nassets/businesses, net\nDividends to shareholders\nCash flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $25.5 billion at the end of the fiscal first quarter of 2024 as compared with $21.9\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2023.

Furthermore, in September 2023, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit\nFacility of $10 billion (expiration on September 5, 2024) which may be used for general corporate purposes\nincluding to support our commercial paper borrowings. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line\nagreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate\nas allowed plus applicable margins.

The Company anticipates that operating cash flows, the\nability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit facilities and\naccess to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund operating needs,\nincluding the Company’s remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation for approximately\n$2.1 billion and the approximately $11.0 billion ($13.7 billion nominal) reserve remaining for the talc settlement\nproposal (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In addition, the Company\nmonitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise capital when market\nconditions are favorable.\nSubsequent to March 31, 2024, the Company paid approximately $2.6 billion to the U.S. Treasury, including $2.0\nbillion related to the current installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge (see\nNote 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year\nended December 31, 2023) and $0.6 billion primarily related to the normal estimated payment for the fiscal first\nquarter of 2024.\nDividends\nOn January 2, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.19 per share, payable on March 5,\n2024, to shareholders of record as of February 20, 2024.\nOn April 16, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on June 4,\n2024, to shareholders of record as of May 21, 2024.

(Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nInflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that\nthe IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and\ntherefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the\ndistrict court’s denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\n48\nTable of Contents\nRussia-Ukraine war\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal first quarter ending March 31, 2024, and the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s\nconsolidated assets and revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue\nseparation.\nIn March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare\npurposes.\nConflict in the Middle East\nAlthough the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal first quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal three months ending March 31, 2024, and the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented approximately 1% of the Company’s\nconsolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.\nOther Macroeconomic Considerations\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency\nexchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company\noperates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey as highly inflationary, as\nthe prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives\nto maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price\nincreases.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealth care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar\nmanufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products\nprior to the expiration of the applicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the\nCompany’s patents. In the event the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the\nresulting lawsuits, generic or biosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market,\nresulting in the potential for substantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result\nin a non-cash impairment charge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors\ncould launch a generic or biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one\nor more valid patents are in place.\nForm 10-Q49\nTable of Contents",
