The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of September 29, 2024, the cumulative amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA\namounted to $ 3.3billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company\nmonitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low because the\nCompany primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit\nrating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of September 29, 2024, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 46.9billion, $ 40.4billion and $ 9.0billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps\nand interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other\ncomprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense\nusing the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly\neffective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly\neffective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2024 to 2044 as a net investment\nhedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of September 29, 2024, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income was $ 641million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of\nComprehensive Income and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward\nforeign exchange contracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions\nthat are expected to occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging\ntransaction exposure is 18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount\nultimately realized in earnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are\nultimately determined by actual exchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\nForm 10-Q11\nTable of Contents\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related

A debt-for-equity exchange was\ncompleted in the fiscal second quarter of 2024.\nOn May 15, 2024, the Company issued $ 3.6billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $\n3.6billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17, 2024, the Company completed a\nDebt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial\nPaper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged, and the\nCompany no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $\n0.4billion recorded in Other (income) expense.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest\npriority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\nForm 10-Q15\nTable

The change in the consolidated tax rate as compared to the prior year is primarily due to charges of\napproximately $ 5.1billion in the fiscal nine months of 2024 and approximately $ 7.0billion in the fiscal nine\nmonths of 2023, both related to talc matters. Both charges were recorded at an effective U.S. federal and state tax\nrate of approximately 23% (for further information see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). Further,\nthe Company acquired Yellow Jersey Therapeutics AG (Yellow Jersey), a demerged subsidiary of Numab Therapeutics AG,\nto secure the global rights to NM26, a bispecific antibody compound and recorded a related $ 1.25billion non-tax-\ndeductible expense associated with the acquisition in the fiscal third quarter of 2024 (for further information see\nNote 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statement).\nAdditionally in the fiscal nine months of 2024, the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by legislative\nchanges that went into effect for Pillar Two in some of the Company's foreign jurisdictions which were partially\noffset by an increase in available U.S. foreign tax credits. The Company incurred tax audit expenses in the fiscal\nsecond quarter of 2024 related to multi-year transfer pricing agreements with the IRS and certain other foreign\njurisdictions.\nAs of September 29, 2024, the Company had approximately $ 2.4billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress\nin a number of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed\nits audit for the tax years through 2016 and has commenced the audit for tax years 2017 through 2020.\nThe Company currently expects completion of multi-year transfer pricing agreements with the IRS and certain other\nforeign jurisdictions in the next 12 months. As a result, the Company has classified approximately $ 0.4billion of\nunrecognized tax benefits and associated interest as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2024 in anticipation of final\nsettlement.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to\nprovide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax\npositions.\nForm 10-Q19\nTable of Contents\nNote 6 — Pensions and other benefit plans\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans include the\nfollowing components:\nFiscal                                               Fiscal\nThird                                                Nine\nQuarter                                              Months\nEnded                                                Ended\nRetire…                 Other                        Retire…                Other\nPlans               Benefit                          Plans              Benefit\nPlans                                               Plans\n(Doll…             Septem…    October    Septem…    October             Septem…    October    Septe…    October\nin                     29,    1, 2023        29,    1, 2023                 29,    1, 2023       29,    1, 2023\nMilli…                2024                  2024                           2024                 2024\nServi…                $225        209         69         61                 671        634       207        198\ncost\nInter…                 351        361         53         51               1,054      1,084       157        160\ncost\nExpec…\nreturn\non                    -643       -680         -2         -1              -1,924     -2,042        -5         -4\nplan\nassets\nAmort…\nof\nprior                  -46        -47          —          —                -138       -139        -1         -1\nservi…\ncost/…\nRecog…\nactua…                  43        -50         13          4                 130       -150        39         17\n(gain…\nCurta…\nand                      6        109          —         -4                  -2        109         —         -4\nsettl…\nNet\nperio…               $(64)        -98        133        111                -209       -504       397        366\nbenef…\ncost/…\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and in the fiscal third quarter\nand fiscal nine months of 2023, Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the\nseparation of Kenvue.

The transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition, and result in an in-\nprocess research and development (IPR&D) charge of approximately $ 0.6billion recorded as part of research and\ndevelopment expense. The results of operations will be included in the MedTech segment as of the acquisition date.\nDuring the fiscal third quarter of 2024, on July 11, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Yellow Jersey,\na demerged subsidiary of Numab Therapeutics AG, to secure the global rights to NM26, a novel, investigational\nfirst-in-class bispecific antibody targeting two clinically proven pathways in atopic dermatitis (AD), in an all-\ncash transaction for approximately $ 1.25billion. The transaction is being accounted for as an asset acquisition,\nresulting in an in-process research and development (IPR&D) charge of approximately $ 1.25billion recorded as part\nof research and development expense and the results of operations is included in the Innovative Medicine segment as\nof the acquisition date. Remaining acquisitions in fiscal third quarter of 2024 were not material.\nDuring the fiscal second quarter of 2024, on June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix,\nInc., a privately held biotechnology company focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, for\napproximately $ 0.8billion net of cash acquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment. The\ntransaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations were included in the\nInnovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets\nacquired of $ 1.2billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $\n0.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion, and $ 0.3billion of liabilities acquired which included $ 0.1billion related\nto a contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation\nadjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 30% to 45% was used in the\nfair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied\nwas approximately 16%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business\nacquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the\nfiscal third quarter and nine months of 2024 were notmaterial.\nDuring the fiscal second quarter of 2024, on May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Shockwave\nMedical Inc.

The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is\nnot expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal third quarter\nwere $ 0.2billion primarily related to the fair value of the inventory step-up and was recorded in Cost of products\nsold. The fiscal nine months were $ 0.7billion of which $ 0.4billion related to equity awards and was recorded in\nOther (income) expense. The amortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market CAD and PAD\nIVL products with the average weighted lives of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for\nunapproved products. The value of the IPR&D was calculated using a probability-adjusted cash flow projection\ndiscounted for the risk inherent in such projects with the weighted average probability of success factors of\napproximately 50%. The discount rate applied was 9.0%.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2024, on March 7, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx\nBiopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology\ntechnology platform to design and develop next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger\ntransaction for a total equity value of approximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.8billion net of cash acquired. The\nCompany acquired all of the outstanding shares of Ambrx’s common stock for $ 28.00per share through a merger of\nAmbrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results\nof operations were included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the\nacquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 2.3billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets,\ninclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $ 1.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.5billion,\nwhich includes deferred taxes of $ 0.4billion. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any\nsubsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 40% to\n70% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The\ndiscount rate applied was approximately 17%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise\nfrom the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs\nbefore tax for the fiscal nine months of 2024 were not material.\nForm 10-Q29\nTable of Contents\nDivestitures\nIn the fiscal third quarter of 2024, the Company divestitures were not material. In the fiscal second quarter of\n2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Acclarent resulting in approximately $ 0.3billion in proceeds. In\nthe fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Ponvory outside of the U.S. resulting in\napproximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds.\nThere were no material acquisitions or divestitures in the fiscal first, second or third quarter of 2023.\nNote 11 — Legal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of September 29, 2024, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against the\nCompany and its affiliates arising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have\nbeen verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson,\net al. , No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the\ncase to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a\nreview of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the\naward, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the\nterms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the\nCompany. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that\nit has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain\ncircumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the\nMississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’\nuse of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The\nCompany has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\n30\nTable of Contents\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its\ntalcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group\nof state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements\nwere finalized.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and threenew entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and a direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent,\nJohnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey company (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets\nand became solely responsible for the talc-related liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in\nany way to injury or damage, or alleged injury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or\nexposure to, talc, including talc contained in any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such\ndamage or injury, except for any liabilities for which the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’\ncompensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against\nLTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance\ncompanies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to\nthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL\nBankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in\nMarch 2022.\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\nBankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\nIn April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy\nCase). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to\nsection 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining\norder staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other\nparties (the New Protected Parties).\nAlso in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the\nCompany and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained\nin force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary\nInjunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for those cases filed in the federal court\novarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was permitted\nto proceed.\nFurthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed\nby similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023,\nthe court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the\ndecision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October\n2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. In July 2024, the Third Circuit issued a non-\nprecedential opinion affirming the Bankruptcy Court's decision to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy case.\nIn October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to\nachieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision;\n(ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its\ndismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative\nclaims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products. In\nDecember 2023, LTL changed its state of formation to Texas and its name to LLT Management LLC (\"LLT\").\nFollowing the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were\nreactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a\nmulti-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL,\ncase-specific discovery is proceeding, and a trial is scheduled to occur in December 2024. In March 2024, the court\ngranted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert hearing prior to the trial. The briefing on the renewed Daubert\nissues was completed in August 2024.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company commenced a three-monthsolicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged”\nchapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the “Proposed Plan”) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and\nfuture claims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State\nconsumer protection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $\n6.475billion payable over 25years (nominal value of approximately $ 8.0billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The\nclaims encompassed by the Proposed Plan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its\ntalc powder products.\nForm 10-Q31\nTable of Contents\nOn August 19, 2024, LLT engaged in a restructuring that resulted in the creation of three new Texas limited\nliability companies: (a) Red River Talc, LLC (\"Red River\"); (b) Pecos River Talc LLC (\"Pecos River\"); and (3) New\nHoldco (Texas) LLC. As a result of this restructuring, all claims related to ovarian and other gynecological\ncancers were separated and allocated to Red River, and mesothelioma, governmental unit and certain other claims\nwere allocated to Pecos River.\nOn September 20, 2024, while reiterating the Company's continued confidence in the safety of its talc products, Red\nRiver filed a voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas,\nseeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the Red River Bankruptcy Case), in furtherance of the\nCompany's consensual \"prepackaged\" Proposed Plan. Red River also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order,\nseeking to extend the automatic stay to additional non-debtor entities. Prior to filing, the initial proposed plan\nwas amended to, among other things, increase the proposed resolution by $ 1.75billion.\nShortly after Red River filed its Chapter 11 petition, the U.S. Trustee's office filed a motion to transfer venue\nin the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court, and thereafter, a motion to transfer venue in the Texas Bankruptcy Court. A\ncoalition of six plaintiff law firms also filed a motion to transfer venue and a motion to dismiss in the Texas\nBankruptcy Court. On September 23, 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court entered a temporary order enjoining the\ncommencement or prosecution of all claims against Red River and certain non-debtor entities, including the Company,\nuntil October 11, 2024. On September 24, 2024, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied the U.S. Trustee's motion to\ntransfer venue without prejudice. On October 10, 2024, the Texas Bankruptcy Court denied the motion to transfer\nvenue from Texas to New Jersey Bankruptcy Court.\nMesothelioma and State consumer protection claims are being addressed outside the Proposed Plan. The Company\nseparately has resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date and has resolved the State claims.\nTo account for these settlements and the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the\nCompany recorded a cumulative incremental charge of approximately $ 5.0billion, through the third fiscal quarter\n2024. As of September 29, 2024, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $ 12.0billion (or nominal\nvalue of approximately $ 13.9billion), net of payments made in fiscal 2024. Approximately one-third of the reserve\nis recorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable loss.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nchapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury\nfrom exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company\nfor indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan\n(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its\nalleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust\nwould pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification\nfrom the Company.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus\nPlan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary\ncontribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims\nasserted against it and certain affiliated parties.\nIn September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar\nconstruct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain\nother protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights\nagainst the Company.\nIn July 2024, the Company, Imerys, and Cyprus and certain of their affiliates (including their parent entities),\nand the tort claimants' committees and future claimants' representatives appointed in their respective Chapter 11\ncases entered into a global settlement agreement (the Imerys Settlement Agreement) to resolve their ongoing\ndisputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus bankruptcies. In August 2024, Imerys and Cyprus filed\namended Chapter 11 plans and disclosure statements incorporating the terms of the settlement with the Company. In\nOctober 2024, the Imerys Bankruptcy Court approved the Imerys Settlement Agreement. A joint hearing to consider\napproval of the Imerys and Cyprus disclosure statements is scheduled for October 28, 2024.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. The\ncase was stayed in May 2022 pursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the\nCourt granted Plaintiff’s motion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the\nThird Circuit under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class\ncertification, and in February 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In February 2024, fact\ndiscovery closed, the Court ordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending mediation. In May 2024, the\nparties participated in an unsuccessful mediation. In June 2024, at the parties' request, the Court lifted the stay\nfor certain limited discovery, but otherwise kept the stay in place pending a decision from the Third Circuit on\nthe 23(f) petition. Briefing on the 23(f) petition was completed in September 2024.\n32\nTable of Contents\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases were filed by state and local governments,\nwhich were subject to a final settlement in 2021. As of September 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or\notherwise resolved the opioid claims advanced by all government entity claimants except a number of school\ndistricts and public hospital systems. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and\norganizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle all remaining state and subdivision\nclaims for up to $ 5.0billion. Approximately 70% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal third\nquarter 2024.\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, hospitals, and health insurers/payors. In\nSeptember 2024, the Company reached an agreement to resolve the hospital cases. Counting the private litigant\ncases, there are approximately 20remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various state courts,\n390remaining cases in the Ohio MDL, and 3additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these cases have been\ndismissed and are being appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in 2025 or 2026.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class\naction on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on\nbehalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed\nclass action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against\nJanssen Inc. and other industry members in April 2024; leave to appeal has been sought. These actions allege a\nvariety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public\nnuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. An adverse\njudgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant\ndamages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nIn November 2019, a shareholder filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the nominal defendant and\ncertain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint\nalleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages\nas a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations\nagainst the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By\n2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted the\nCompany’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice\nof dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed appealed the state court’s dismissal order, and\nbriefing on the appeal concluded in October 2022. In February 2024, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of\nthe shareholder's amended complaint. In March 2024, the shareholder filed a notice of petition for certification\nwith the Supreme Court of New Jersey seeking review of the appellate court's decision. In May 2024, briefing on the\nshareholder's petition for certification concluded. In September 2024, the New Jersey Supreme Court denied the\nshareholder's petition for certification.\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each\nrelated legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to\ndefend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the\nCompany has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other\nlosses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the\nworld, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be\nrequired in the future as additional information becomes available.\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of September 29, 2024:\nForm 10-Q33\nTable of Contents\nProduct or product category                          Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S                          62,740\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip                              160\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                                                910\nPelvic meshes                                                               6,190\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh                                    160\nRISPERDAL                                                                      10\nELMIRON                                                                     2,170\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL acetabular system and ASR Hip resurfacing system\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established\naccruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability\nlitigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established\na United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have\nbeen settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\nAcetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nand Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia,\n34\nTable of Contents\nCanada and South Africa. The vast majority of these actions are now resolved. The Company has established accruals\nwith respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed\nfor Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In\nMay 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately\n3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master\nsettlement agreement (MSA) was entered into in September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other\nthan a small number of cases still pending in the MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been\nresolved or are undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases. Cases involving this product have also been filed in other federal and state\ncourts in the United States.\nIn October 2022, an agreement in principle, subject to various conditions, was reached to settle the majority of\nthe pending cases involving Proceed, Proceed Ventral Patch, Prolene Hernia System and related multi-layered mesh\nproducts, as well as a number of unfiled claims. All litigation activities in the two New Jersey MCLs are stayed\npending effectuation of the proposed settlement. Future cases that are filed in the New Jersey MCLs will be subject\nto docket control orders requiring early expert reports and discovery requirements.\nThe Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with Ethicon\nPhysiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh, PROCEED Mesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch, and PROLENE Polypropylene Hernia System\nproducts.\nInnovative Medicine\nRISPERDAL\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company arising out of the\nuse of RISPERDAL, and related compounds, indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, acute manic or mixed\nepisodes associated with bipolar I disorder and irritability associated with autism. Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. The Company continues to defend RISPERDAL product liability lawsuits, and continues to\nevaluate potential costs related to those claims. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but\nthere have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive\ndamages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021,\nthe Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in\nsubstantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States. The costs associated with this and other\nsettlements are reflected in the Company’s accruals.\nELMIRON\nClaims for personal injury have been made against a number of Johnson & Johnson companies, including Janssen\nPharmaceuticals, Inc. and the Company, arising out of the use of ELMIRON, a prescription medication indicated for\nthe relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with interstitial cystitis. These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been\nfiled in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen\nCounty, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort\ndesignation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. The Company continues to defend\nELMIRON product liability lawsuits and\nForm 10-Q35\nTable of Contents\ncontinues to evaluate potential costs related to those claims. All U.S. based ELMIRON matters have been resolved or\nare undergoing formal review for purposes of settlement. The Company has established accruals for defense and\nindemnity costs associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.\nIntellectual Property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that\ncertain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these\nsubsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all\nsignificant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases\ncould adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to\nloss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash\nimpairment charge for any associated intangible asset.\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication\n“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of\nthese lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic\nversion of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court\nrulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce\ngeneric versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and\nrevenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\nintangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and\nsuch settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to\nthe expiration of the relevant patents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents.

The growth\nof TREMFYA (guselkumab) was due to market growth and share gains partially offset by unfavorable patient mix. The\ngrowth was offset by declines of STELARA (ustekinumab) sales driven by net unfavorable patient mix and share loss\nprimarily due to European biosimilar entrants partially offset by market growth, SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA sales due to\nreturn of rights by Merck, Sharp & Dohme in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024, and lower sales of REMICADE\n(infliximab) due to biosimilar competition.\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA.\nThe Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a\nresult of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the\nlaunch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States. In July 2024, a biosimilar\nversion of STELARA launched in certain European markets for certain indications.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nInfectious disease products experienced an operational decline of 2.4% as compared to the same period a year ago\nprimarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue. The Company does not anticipate any COVID-19 vaccine\nrevenue in the remainder of fiscal 2024.\nNeuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 1.7% as compared to the same period a year ago. The\ngrowth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by the ongoing launch and increased physician and patient demand. Growth\nwas partially offset by declines in Other Neuroscience.\nOncology products achieved operational sales growth of 20.5% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong\nsales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions and market growth. Growth of\nERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and inventory dynamics. Increased sales of CARVYKTI\n(ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing\nefficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and the launch of TALVEY\n(talquetamab-tgvs) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab) in Other Oncology contributed to the growth. Growth was partially\noffset by ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) declines due to\ncompetitive pressures.\nPulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 17.0% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales\ngrowth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) was driven by favorable patient mix, market growth and share gains. Sales growth of\nUPTRAVI (selexipag) was driven by market growth, favorable patient mix and share gains partially offset by\ninventory dynamics in the U.S.\nCardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 7.2% as compared to the same\nperiod a year ago. The decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and\nshare loss.\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B\ncovered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee\ncovered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been\nand will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it\nbelieves its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited\nby the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug\nmanufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities.\n46\nTable of Contents\nMedTech\nThe MedTech segment sales in the fiscal nine months of 2024 were $23.7 billion, an increase of 4.1% as compared to\nthe same period a year ago, with an operational increase of 5.7% and a negative currency impact of 1.6%.

The litigation requests a declaration that\nthe IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and\ntherefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the\ndistrict court’s denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\nRussia-Ukraine war\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal third quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal nine months ending September 29, 2024, and the fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s\nconsolidated assets and revenues.

Inflation rates and currency\nexchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company\noperates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey as highly inflationary, as\nthe prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives\nto maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price\nincreases.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealth care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar\nmanufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products\nprior to the expiration of the applicable patents.
