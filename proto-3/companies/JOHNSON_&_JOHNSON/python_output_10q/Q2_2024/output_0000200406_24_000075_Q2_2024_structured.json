The Company uses cross currency interest rate swaps to manage currency\nrisk primarily related to borrowings. Both types of derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges.\nAdditionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps as an instrument to manage interest rate risk related to fixed\nrate borrowings. These derivatives are designated as fair value hedges. The Company uses cross currency interest\nrate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges. Additionally, the Company\nuses forward foreign exchange contracts to offset its exposure to certain foreign currency assets and liabilities.\nThese forward foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges, and therefore, changes in the fair values of\nthese derivatives are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related foreign\ncurrency assets and liabilities.\nThe Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes, or that\ncontain credit risk related contingent features. The Company maintains credit support agreements (CSA) with certain\nderivative counterparties establishing collateral thresholds based on respective credit ratings and netting\nagreements. As of June 30, 2024, the cumulative amount of cash collateral paid by the Company under the CSA\namounted to $ 2.3billion net, related to net investment and cash flow hedges. On an ongoing basis, the Company\nmonitors counter-party credit ratings. The Company considers credit non-performance risk to be low because the\nCompany primarily enters into agreements with commercial institutions that have at least an investment grade credit\nrating. Refer to the table on significant financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value contained in this\nfootnote for receivables and payables with these commercial institutions. As of June 30, 2024, the Company had\nnotional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps and\ninterest rate swaps of $ 44.5billion, $ 41.0billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, the\nCompany had notional amounts outstanding for forward foreign exchange contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps\nand interest rate swaps of $ 42.9billion, $ 39.7billion and $ 10.0billion, respectively.\nAll derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of\nderivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income, depending on whether the\nderivative is designated as part of a hedge transaction, and if so, the type of hedge transaction.\nThe designation as a cash flow hedge is made at the entrance date of the derivative contract. At inception, all\nderivatives are expected to be highly effective. Foreign exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are\naccounted for under the forward method and all gains/losses associated with these contracts will be recognized in\nthe income statement when the hedged item impacts earnings. Changes in the fair value of these derivatives are\nrecorded in accumulated other comprehensive income until the underlying transaction affects earnings and are then\nreclassified to earnings in the same account as the hedged transaction.\nGains and losses associated with interest rate swaps and changes in fair value of hedged debt attributable to\nchanges in interest rates are recorded to interest expense in the period in which they occur. Gains and losses on\nnet investment hedges are accounted for through the currency translation account within accumulated other\ncomprehensive income. The portion excluded from effectiveness testing is recorded through interest (income) expense\nusing the spot method. On an ongoing basis, the Company assesses whether each derivative continues to be highly\neffective in offsetting changes of hedged items. If and when a derivative is no longer expected to be highly\neffective, hedge accounting is discontinued.\nThe Company designated its Euro denominated notes with due dates ranging from 2024 to 2044 as a net investment\nhedge of the Company's investments in certain of its international subsidiaries that use the Euro as their\nfunctional currency in order to reduce the volatility caused by changes in exchange rates.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the balance of deferred net loss on derivatives included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome was $ 899million after-tax. For additional information, see the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive\nIncome and Note 7. The Company expects that substantially all of the amounts related to forward foreign exchange\ncontracts will be reclassified into earnings over the next 12 months as a result of transactions that are expected\nto occur over that period. The maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging transaction exposure is\n18months, excluding interest rate contracts and net investment hedge contracts. The amount ultimately realized in\nearnings may differ as foreign exchange rates change. Realized gains and losses are ultimately determined by actual\nexchange rates at maturity of the derivative.\nForm 10-Q11\nTable of Contents\nThe following table is a summary of the activity related

A debt to equity exchange was\ncompleted in the fiscal second quarter of 2024.\nOn May 15, 2024, the Company issued $ 3.6billion aggregate principal amount of commercial paper and received $\n3.6billion of net cash proceeds to be used for general corporate purposes. On May 17, 2024, the Company completed a\nDebt-for-Equity Exchange of its remaining 182,329,550shares of Kenvue Common Stock for the outstanding Commercial\nPaper. Upon completion of the Debt-for-Equity Exchange, the Commercial Paper was satisfied and discharged and the\nCompany no longer owns any shares of Kenvue Common Stock. This exchange resulted in a loss of approximately $\n0.4billion recorded in Other (income) expense.\nFair value is the exit price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. Fair value is\na market-based measurement determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or\nliability. In accordance with ASC 820, a three-level hierarchy was established to prioritize the inputs used in\nmeasuring fair value. The levels within the hierarchy are described below with Level 1 inputs having the highest\npriority and Level 3 inputs having the lowest.\nThe fair value of a derivative financial instrument (i.e., forward foreign exchange contracts, interest rate\ncontracts) is the aggregation by currency of all future cash flows discounted to its present value at the\nprevailing market interest rates and subsequently converted to the U.S. Dollar at the current spot foreign exchange\nrate. The Company does not believe that fair values of these derivative instruments materially differ from the\namounts that could be realized upon settlement or maturity, or that the changes in fair value will have a material\neffect on the Company’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. The Company also holds equity\ninvestments which are classified as Level 1 and debt securities which are classified as Level 2. The Company holds\nacquisition related contingent liabilities based upon certain regulatory and commercial events, which are\nclassified as Level 3, whose values are determined using discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques\nfor which the determination of fair value requires significant judgment or estimations.\nThe following three levels of inputs are used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities.\nLevel 2 — Significant other observable inputs.\nLevel 3 — Significant unobservable inputs.\nForm 10-Q15\nTable

issued senior unsecured notes for a total of $ 6.7billion.\nThe net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Shockwave acquisition which closed on May 31, 2024, and\nfor general corporate purposes.\n18\nTable of Contents\nThe weighted average effective interest rate on non-current debt is 3.28%.\nThe excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value of debt was $ 1.0billion at December 31, 2023.\nFair value of the non-current debt was estimated using market prices, which were corroborated by quoted broker\nprices and significant other observable inputs.\nThe current debt balance as of June 30, 2024 includes $ 8.5billion of commercial paper which has a weighted average\ninterest rate of 5.28% and a weighted average maturity of approximately one month.\nNote 5 — Income taxes\nThe worldwide effective income tax rates for the fiscal six months of 2024 and 2023 were 16.1% and 2.7%,\nrespectively. The change in the consolidated tax rate as compared to the prior year is primarily due to a charge of\n$ 7.0billion in the fiscal six months of 2023 and a charge of $ 3.0billion in the fiscal six months of 2024, both\nrelated to talc matters. Both charges were recorded at an effective U.S. federal and state tax rate of\napproximately 23% (for further information see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).\nAdditionally in the fiscal six months of 2024, the effective tax rate was unfavorably impacted by legislative\nchanges that went into effect for Pillar Two in some of the Company's foreign jurisdictions as well as tax audit\nexpenses incurred in the fiscal second quarter of 2024 related to multi-year transfer pricing agreements with the\nIRS and certain other foreign jurisdictions.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had approximately $ 2.5billion of liabilities from unrecognized tax benefits. The\nCompany conducts business and files tax returns in numerous countries and currently has tax audits in progress in a\nnumber of jurisdictions. With respect to the United States, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has completed its\naudit for the tax years through 2016 and in the fiscal first quarter of 2024 has commenced the audit for tax years\n2017 through 2020.\nThe Company currently expects completion of multi-year transfer pricing agreements with the IRS and certain other\nforeign jurisdictions in the next 12 months. As a result, the Company has classified approximately $ 0.4billion of\nunrecognized tax benefits and associated interest as a current liability on the “Accrued taxes on Income” line of\nthe Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the end of the second fiscal quarter of 2024 in anticipation of final\nsettlement.\nIn other major jurisdictions where the Company conducts business, the years that remain open to tax audit go back\nto the year 2013. The Company believes it is possible that tax audits may be completed over the next twelve months\nby taxing authorities in some jurisdictions outside of the United States. However, the Company is not able to\nprovide a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of any other future tax payments relating to uncertain tax\npositions.\nNote 6 — Pensions and other benefit plans\nComponents of net periodic benefit cost\nNet periodic benefit costs for the Company’s defined benefit retirement plans and other benefit plans include the\nfollowing components:\nFiscal                                               Fiscal\nSecond                                               Six\nQuarter                                              Months\nEnded                                                Ended\nRetire…                 Other                        Retire…                Other\nPlans               Benefit                          Plans               Benef…\nPlans                                               Plans\n(Doll…                June    July 2,       June    July 2,                June    July 2,       June      July\nin                     30,       2023        30,       2023                 30,       2023        30,        2,\nMilli…                2024                  2024                           2024                  2024      2023\nServi…                $222        215         69         69                 446        425        138       137\ncost\nInter…                 351        371         52         55                 703        723        104       109\ncost\nExpec…\nreturn\non                    -639       -694         -1         -2              -1,281     -1,362         -3        -3\nplan\nassets\nAmort…\nof\nprior                  -46        -46         -1         -1                 -92        -92         -1        -1\nservi…\ncost/…\nRecog…\nactua…                  44        -50         13          7                  87       -100         26        13\n(gain…\nCurta…\nand                     -8          —          —          —                  -8          —          —         —\nsettl…\nNet\nperio…               $(76)       -204        132        128                -145       -406        264       255\nbenef…\ncost/…\nForm 10-Q19\nTable of Contents\nThe service cost component of net periodic benefit cost is presented in the same line items on the Consolidated\nStatement of Earnings where other employee compensation costs are reported, including Cost of products sold,\nResearch and development expense, Selling, marketing and administrative expenses, and in the fiscal second quarter\nand fiscal six months of 2023, Net earnings from discontinued operations, net of taxes if related to the separation\nof Kenvue.

The transaction is being accounted for as an\nasset acquisition, resulting in an in-process research and development (IPR&D) charge of approximately $\n1.25billion recorded as part of research and development expense and the results of operations will be included in\nthe Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The acquisition is not expected to be deductible for\ntax purposes.\nOn June 20, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Proteologix, Inc., a privately held biotechnology\ncompany focused on bispecific antibodies for immune-mediated diseases, for approximately $ 0.8billion net of cash\nacquired, with potential for an additional milestone payment. The transaction was accounted for as a business\ncombination and the results of operations were included in the Innovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition\ndate. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets acquired of $ 1.2billion, primarily non-amortizable\nintangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $ 0.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion, and $ 0.3billion of\nliabilities acquired which included $ 0.1billion related to a contingent consideration. The preliminary purchase\nprice allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement period. A probability of\nsuccess factor ranging from 30% to 45% was used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent regulatory and\ncommercial risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. The goodwill is primarily\nattributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for\ntax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal second quarter of 2024 were notmaterial.\nOn May 31, 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Shockwave Medical Inc. (SWAV)(Shockwave), a leading,\nfirst-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the treatment of calcified\ncoronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD) in an all-cash merger transaction. The Company\nacquired all the outstanding shares of Shockwave’s common stock for $ 335.00per share through a merger of Shockwave\nwith a subsidiary of the Company. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of\noperations were included in the MedTech segment as of the acquisition date.\n28\nTable of Contents\nDetails of the fair value amounts recognized for assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate:\n(Dollars in Billions)\nAssets acquired:\nCash                                           $1.1\nGoodwill                                        7.5\nAmortizable intangibles                         5.3\nIPR&D                                           0.6\nInventory                                       0.5\nOther assets                                    0.5\nTotal assets acquired                         $15.5\nLiabilities assumed:\nDeferred taxes                                 $1.5\nNotes payable*                                  1.0\nAccrued liabilities**                           0.4\nTotal liabilities assumed                      $2.9\nNet assets acquired                           $12.6\nNet assets acquired as of May 31, 2024        $12.6\nLess: Cash acquired                             1.1\nEquity awards settled                           0.6\nSettlement of Note payable*                     1.0\nTotal enterprise value as of June 30, 2024    $13.1\nRepresents the convertible debt which was subsequently paid in the fiscal second quarter of 2024.\n** Includes $ 0.2billion of equity awards\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the measurement\nperiod. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is\nnot expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal second quarter\nwere $ 0.5billion of which $ 0.4billion related to equity awards and was recorded in Other (income) expense. The\namortizable intangible assets were primarily comprised of already in-market CAD and PAD IVL products with the\naverage weighted lives of 14years. The IPR&D assets were valued for technology programs for unapproved products.\nThe value of the IPR&D was calculated using a probability-adjusted cash flow projection discounted for the risk\ninherent in such projects with the weighted average probability of success factors of approximately 50%. The\ndiscount rate applied was 9.0%.\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the acquisition of Ambrx Biopharma, Inc., (Ambrx), a\nclinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary synthetic biology technology platform to design and\ndevelop next-generation antibody drug conjugates (ADCs), in an all-cash merger transaction for a total equity value\nof approximately $ 2.0billion, or $ 1.8billion net of cash acquired. The Company acquired all of the outstanding\nshares of Ambrx’s common stock for $ 28.00per share through a merger of Ambrx with a subsidiary of the Company. The\ntransaction was accounted for as a business combination and the results of operations were included in the\nInnovative Medicine segment as of the acquisition date. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated to assets\nacquired of $ 2.3billion, primarily non-amortizable intangible assets, inclusive of purchased IPR&D, for $\n1.9billion, goodwill for $ 0.3billion and liabilities assumed of $ 0.5billion, which includes deferred taxes of $\n0.4billion. The preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to any subsequent valuation adjustments within the\nmeasurement period. A probability of success factor ranging from 40% to 70% was used in the fair value calculation\nto reflect inherent regulatory and commercial risk of the IPR&D. The discount rate applied was approximately 17%.\nThe goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not\nexpected to be deductible for tax purposes. Acquisition related costs before tax for the fiscal six months of 2024\nwere not material.\nDivestitures\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Acclarent resulting in approximately\n$ 0.3billion in proceeds. In the fiscal first quarter of 2024, the Company completed the divestiture of Ponvory\noutside of the U.S. resulting in approximately $ 0.2billion in proceeds.\nThere were no material acquisitions or divestitures in the fiscal first quarter or fiscal second quarter of 2023.\nForm 10-Q29\nTable of Contents\nNote 11 — Legal Proceedings\nJohnson & Johnson and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits and claims regarding product\nliability; intellectual property; commercial; indemnification and other matters; governmental investigations; and\nother legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of their business.\nThe Company records accruals for loss contingencies associated with these legal matters when it is probable that a\nliability will be incurred, and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. As of June 30, 2024, the\nCompany has determined that the liabilities associated with certain litigation matters are probable and can be\nreasonably estimated. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each related legal\nissue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in accordance\nwith ASC 450-20-25. For these and other litigation and regulatory matters discussed below for which a loss is\nprobable or reasonably possible, the Company is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss beyond the\namounts accrued. Amounts accrued for legal contingencies often result from a complex series of judgments about\nfuture events and uncertainties that rely heavily on estimates and assumptions including timing of related\npayments. The ability to make such estimates and judgments can be affected by various factors including, among\nother things, whether damages sought in the proceedings are unsubstantiated or indeterminate; scientific and legal\ndiscovery has not commenced or is not complete; proceedings are in early stages; matters present legal\nuncertainties; there are significant facts in dispute; procedural or jurisdictional issues; the uncertainty and\nunpredictability of the number of potential claims; ability to achieve comprehensive multi-party settlements;\ncomplexity of related cross-claims and counterclaims; and/or there are numerous parties involved. To the extent\nadverse awards, judgments or verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an\naccrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\nIn the Company’s opinion, based on its examination of these matters, its experience to date and discussions with\ncounsel, the ultimate outcome of legal proceedings, net of liabilities accrued in the Company’s balance sheet, is\nnot expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position. However, the resolution of, or\nincrease in accruals for, one or more of these matters in any reporting period may have a material adverse effect\non the Company’s results of operations and cash flows for that period.\nMatters concerning talc\nA significant number of personal injury claims alleging that talc causes cancer have been asserted against Johnson\n& Johnson Consumer Inc., its successor LLT Management LLC (previously known as LTL Management LLC) and the Company\narising out of the use of body powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S Baby Powder.\nIn talc cases that have gone to trial, the Company has obtained a number of defense verdicts, but there also have\nbeen verdicts against the Company, many of which have been reversed on appeal. In June 2020, the Missouri Court of\nAppeals reversed in part and affirmed in part a July 2018 verdict of $ 4.7billion in Ingham v. Johnson & Johnson,\net al., No. ED 207476 (Mo. App.), reducing the overall award to $ 2.1billion. An application for transfer of the\ncase to the Missouri Supreme Court was subsequently denied, and in June 2021, a petition for certiorari, seeking a\nreview of the Ingham decision by the United States Supreme Court, was denied. In June 2021, the Company paid the\naward, which, including interest, totaled approximately $ 2.5billion. The facts and circumstances, including the\nterms of the award, were unique to the Ingham decision and not representative of other claims brought against the\nCompany. The Company continues to believe that it has strong legal grounds to contest the other talc verdicts that\nit has appealed. Notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, in certain\ncircumstances the Company has settled cases.\nIn June 2014, the Mississippi Attorney General filed a complaint against the Company alleging violation of the\nMississippi Consumer Protection Act by failing to disclose alleged health risks associated with female consumers’\nuse of talc contained in JOHNSON’S Baby Powder and JOHNSON’S Shower to Shower (a product divested in 2012). The\nCompany has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nIn January 2020, the State of New Mexico filed a consumer protection case alleging that the Company deceptively\nmarketed and sold its talcum powder products by making misrepresentations about the safety of the products and the\npresence of carcinogens, including asbestos. The Company has reached an agreement to resolve this matter.\nForty-two states and the District of Columbia commenced a joint investigation into the Company’s marketing of its\ntalcum powder products. In January 2024, the Company reached an agreement in principle with the multi-state group\nof state Attorneys General, subject to ongoing negotiation of non-monetary terms. In June 2024, the settlements\nwere finalized.\nIn October 2021, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc. (Old JJCI) implemented a corporate restructuring (the 2021\nCorporate Restructuring). As a result of that restructuring, Old JJCI ceased to exist and threenew entities were\ncreated: (a) LTL Management LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (LTL or Debtor); (b) Royalty A&M LLC, a\nNorth Carolina limited liability company and\n30\nTable of Contents\na direct subsidiary of LTL (RAM); and (c) the Debtor’s direct parent, Johnson & Johnson Consumer Inc., a New Jersey\ncompany (New JJCI). The Debtor received certain of Old JJCI’s assets and became solely responsible for the talc-\nrelated liabilities of Old JJCI, including all liabilities related in any way to injury or damage, or alleged\ninjury or damage, sustained or incurred in the purchase or use of, or exposure to, talc, including talc contained\nin any product, or to the risk of, or responsibility for, any such damage or injury, except for any liabilities for\nwhich the exclusive remedy is provided under a workers’ compensation statute or act (the Talc-Related Liabilities).\nIn October 2021, notwithstanding the Company’s confidence in the safety of its talc products, the Debtor filed a\nvoluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina, Charlotte\nDivision, seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL Bankruptcy Case). All litigation against\nLTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, other of their corporate affiliates, identified retailers, insurance\ncompanies, and certain other parties (the Protected Parties) was stayed. The LTL Bankruptcy Case was transferred to\nthe United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. Claimants filed motions to dismiss the LTL\nBankruptcy Case and, following a multiple day hearing, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court denied those motions in\nMarch 2022.\nThe claimants subsequently filed notices of appeal as to the denial of the motions to dismiss the LTL Bankruptcy\nCase and the extension of the stay to the Protected Parties. On January 30, 2023, the Third Circuit reversed the\nBankruptcy Court’s ruling and remanded to the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the LTL bankruptcy.\nIn April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court dismissed the LTL Bankruptcy Case, effectively lifting the stay as\nto all parties and returning the talc litigation to the tort system. LTL re-filed in the United States Bankruptcy\nCourt for the District of New Jersey seeking relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (the LTL 2 Bankruptcy\nCase). As a result of the new filing, all talc claims against LTL were again automatically stayed pursuant to\nsection 362 of the Bankruptcy Code. Additionally, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a temporary restraining\norder staying all litigation as to LTL, Old JJCI, New JJCI, the Company, identified retailers, and certain other\nparties (the New Protected Parties).\nAlso in April 2023, the New Jersey Bankruptcy Court issued a decision that granted limited injunctive relief to the\nCompany and the New Protected Parties (the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction). The LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction remained\nin force until late August 2023, following the Bankruptcy Court’s extension of the initial LTL 2 Preliminary\nInjunction in June 2023. Under the LTL 2 Preliminary Injunction, except for in those cases filed in the federal\ncourt ovarian cancer multi-district litigation, discovery in all personal injury and wrongful death matters was\npermitted to proceed.\nFurthermore, in April 2023, the Talc Claimants' Committee filed a motion to dismiss the LTL 2 Bankruptcy followed\nby similar motions from other claimants. Hearings on the motions to dismiss occurred in June 2023. In July 2023,\nthe court dismissed the LTL 2 Bankruptcy case and, the same day, the Company stated its intent to appeal the\ndecision and to continue its efforts to obtain a resolution of the talc claims. In September 2023, the Bankruptcy\nCourt entered an order granting LTL leave to seek a direct appeal to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In October\n2023, the Third Circuit granted LTL’s petition for a direct appeal. Briefing is ongoing.\nIn October 2023, the Company stated that it was pursuing the following four parallel and alternative pathways to\nachieve a comprehensive and final resolution of the talc claims: (i) the appeal of the LTL 2 dismissal decision;\n(ii) pursuing a consensual “prepackaged” bankruptcy case, as “strongly encouraged” by the Bankruptcy Court in its\ndismissal decision; (iii) aggressively litigating the talc claims in the tort system; and (iv) pursuing affirmative\nclaims against experts for false and defamatory narratives regarding the Company’s talc powder products.\nFollowing the dismissal of LTL 2, new lawsuits were filed, cases across the country that had been stayed were\nreactivated, and trials have commenced. The majority of the cases are pending in federal court, organized in a\nmulti-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. In the MDL,\ncase-specific discovery is proceeding and a trial is scheduled to occur in December 2024. In March 2024, the court\ngranted the Company's motion for a renewed Daubert hearing prior to the trial.\nOn May 1, 2024, the Company commenced a three-month solicitation period of its proposed consensual “prepackaged”\nchapter 11 bankruptcy plan (the “Proposed Plan”) for the comprehensive and final resolution of all current and\nfuture claims related to cosmetic talc in the United States, excluding claims related to mesothelioma or State\nconsumer protection claims, in exchange for the payment by the Company of present value of approximately $\n6.475billion payable over 25years (nominal value of approximately $ 8.0billion, discounted at a rate of 4.4%). The\nclaims encompassed by the Proposed Plan constitute 99.75% of pending lawsuits against the Company relating to its\ntalc powder products. Mesothelioma and State consumer protection claims are being addressed outside the Proposed\nPlan. The Company separately has resolved 95% of the mesothelioma lawsuits filed to date and has resolved the State\nclaims.\nTo account for these settlements and the contemplated comprehensive resolution through the Proposed Plan, the\nCompany recorded an incremental charge of approximately $ 3.0billion, through the second fiscal quarter 2024. As of\nJune 30, 2024, the total present value of the reserve is approximately $ 10.6billion (or nominal value of\napproximately $ 12.8billion), net of payments made in fiscal 2024. Approximately one-third of the reserve is\nrecorded as a current liability. The recorded amount remains the Company's best estimate of probable loss.\nForm 10-Q31\nTable of Contents\nDuring the pendency of the solicitation period, the Company will continue to pursue in parallel the other three\npreviously-announced pathways to resolve the talc claims, including proceeding with the Daubert motions in the MDL.\nIn February 2019, the Company’s talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, Inc. and two of its affiliates, Imerys Talc\nVermont, Inc. and Imerys Talc Canada, Inc. (collectively, Imerys) filed a voluntary petition for relief under\nchapter 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District\nof Delaware (Imerys Bankruptcy). The Imerys Bankruptcy relates to Imerys’s potential liability for personal injury\nfrom exposure to talcum powder sold by Imerys. In its bankruptcy, Imerys alleges it has claims against the Company\nfor indemnification and rights to joint insurance proceeds. In its bankruptcy, Imerys proposed a chapter 11 plan\n(the Imerys Plan) that contemplated all talc-related claims against it being channeled to a trust along with its\nalleged indemnification rights against the Company. Following confirmation and consummation of the plan, the trust\nwould pay talc claims pursuant to proposed trust distribution procedures (the TDP) and then seek indemnification\nfrom the Company.\nIn February 2021, Cyprus Mines Corporation (Cyprus), which had owned certain Imerys talc mines, filed a voluntary\npetition for relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and filed its Disclosure Statement and Plan (the Cyprus\nPlan). The Cyprus Plan contemplates a settlement with Imerys and talc claimants where Cyprus would make a monetary\ncontribution to a trust established under the Imerys Plan in exchange for an injunction against talc claims\nasserted against it and certain affiliated parties.\nIn September 2023, Imerys and Cyprus filed amended plans of reorganization. The amended plans contemplate a similar\nconstruct as the prior Imerys and Cyprus Plans, including all talc claims against Imerys and Cyprus (and certain\nother protected parties) being channeled to a trust along with Imerys’s and Cyprus’s alleged indemnification rights\nagainst the Company. In January 2024, Imerys and Cyprus each filed a disclosure statement for its respective\nChapter 11 plans. On April 29, 2024, the Company, Imerys and Cyprus reached an agreement in principle on monetary\nand non-monetary terms to resolve their ongoing disputes, including disputes raised in the Imerys and Cyprus\nbankruptcies. The parties have finalized the agreement, which will be submitted to the Bankruptcy Court for\napproval on August 15, 2024. Imerys and Cyprus have adjourned the hearing on their respective disclosure statements\npending submission of the agreement to the court.\nIn February 2018, a securities class action lawsuit was filed against the Company and certain named officers in the\nUnited States District Court for the District of New Jersey, alleging that the Company violated the federal\nsecurities laws by failing to disclose alleged asbestos contamination in body powders containing talc, primarily\nJOHNSON’S Baby Powder, and that purchasers of the Company’s shares suffered losses as a result. In April 2019, the\nCompany moved to dismiss the complaint. In December 2019, the Court denied, in part, the motion to dismiss. In\nApril 2021, briefing on Plaintiff’s motion for class certification was completed. The case was stayed in May 2022\npursuant to the LTL Bankruptcy Case and was reopened in May 2023. In December 2023, the Court granted Plaintiff’s\nmotion for class certification. In January 2024, Defendants filed a petition with the Third Circuit under Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 23(f) for permission to appeal the Court’s order granting class certification, and in\nFebruary 2024, the Third Circuit granted Defendants' petition. In February 2024, fact discovery closed, the Court\nordered the parties to mediate, and stayed the case pending mediation. In May 2024, the parties participated in an\nunsuccessful mediation. In June 2024, the parties requested that the case remain stayed, except for certain limited\ndiscovery, pending a decision from the Third Circuit on the 23(f) petition.\nA lawsuit was brought against the Company in the Superior Court of California for the County of San Diego alleging\nviolations of California’s Consumer Legal Remedies Act (CLRA) relating to JOHNSON’S Baby Powder. In that lawsuit,\nthe plaintiffs allege that the Company violated the CLRA by failing to provide required Proposition 65 warnings.\nThe Company removed the lawsuit to the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. In\nJanuary 2021, the court granted the Company's motion to dismiss plaintiffs' Fifth Amended Complaint with prejudice.\nOn April 29, 2024, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court's order dismissing the case with prejudice.\nIn addition, the Company has received inquiries, subpoenas, and requests to produce documents regarding talc\nmatters and the LTL Bankruptcy Case from various governmental authorities. The Company has produced documents and\nresponded to inquiries, and will continue to cooperate with government inquiries.\nMatters concerning opioids\nBeginning in 2014 and continuing to the present, the Company and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (JPI), along with\nother pharmaceutical companies, have been named in close to 3,500lawsuits related to the marketing of opioids,\nincluding DURAGESIC, NUCYNTA and NUCYNTA ER. The majority of the cases were filed by state and local governments,\nwhich were subject to a final settlement in 2021. As of January 2024, the Company and JPI have settled or otherwise\nresolved the opioid claims advanced by all government entity claimants except the City of Baltimore, a number of\nschool districts, and other claimants. Similar lawsuits have also been filed by private plaintiffs and\norganizations, including but not limited to the following: individual plaintiffs on behalf of children born with\nNeonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS); hospitals; and health insurers/payors.\nTo date, the Company and JPI have litigated two of the cases to judgment and have prevailed in both, either at\ntrial or on appeal.\nIn July 2021, the Company announced finalization of an agreement to settle all remaining state and subdivision\nclaims for up to $ 5.0billion. Approximately 70% of the all-in settlement was paid by the end of fiscal second\nquarter 2024.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThe Company and JPI continue to defend the cases brought by the remaining government entity litigants as well as\nthe cases brought by private litigants, including NAS claimants, and health insurers/payors. Counting the private\nlitigant cases, there are approximately 20remaining opioid cases against the Company and JPI in various state\ncourts, 420remaining cases in the Ohio MDL, and 3additional cases in other federal courts. Some of these cases have\nbeen dismissed and are being appealed by the plaintiffs and certain others are scheduled for trial in 2024, 2025,\nor 2026.\nIn addition, the Province of British Columbia filed suit against the Company and its Canadian affiliate Janssen\nInc., and many other industry members, in Canada, and is seeking to have that action certified as an opt in class\naction on behalf of other provincial/territorial and the federal governments in Canada. Additional proposed class\nactions have been filed in Canada against the Company and Janssen Inc., and many other industry members, by and on\nbehalf of people who used opioids (for personal injuries), municipalities and First Nations bands. The proposed\nclass action in Quebec on behalf of residents diagnosed with opioid use disorder was authorized to proceed against\nJanssen Inc. and other industry members in April 2024; leave to appeal has been sought. These actions allege a\nvariety of claims related to opioid marketing practices, including false advertising, unfair competition, public\nnuisance, consumer fraud violations, deceptive acts and practices, false claims and unjust enrichment. An adverse\njudgment in any of these lawsuits could result in the imposition of large monetary penalties and significant\ndamages including, punitive damages, cost of abatement, substantial fines, equitable remedies and other sanctions.\nIn November 2019, a shareholder filed a derivative complaint against the Company as the nominal defendant and\ncertain current and former directors and officers as defendants in the Superior Court of New Jersey. The complaint\nalleges breaches of fiduciary duties related to the marketing of opioids, and that the Company has suffered damages\nas a result of those alleged breaches. A series of additional derivative complaints making similar allegations\nagainst the same and similar defendants were filed in New Jersey state and federal courts in 2019 and 2020. By\n2022, all but two state court cases had been voluntarily dismissed. In February 2022, the state court granted the\nCompany’s motion to dismiss one of the two cases, and the shareholder that brought the second case filed a notice\nof dismissal. The shareholder whose complaint was dismissed appealed the state court’s dismissal order, and\nbriefing on the appeal concluded in October 2022. In February 2024, the appellate court affirmed the dismissal of\nthe shareholder's amended complaint. In March 2024, the shareholder filed a notice of petition for certification\nwith the Supreme Court of New Jersey seeking review of the appellate court's decision. In May 2024, briefing on the\nshareholder's petition for certification concluded.\nProduct liability\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous product liability claims and lawsuits\ninvolving multiple products. Claimants in these cases seek substantial compensatory and, where available, punitive\ndamages. While the Company believes it has substantial defenses, it is not feasible to predict the ultimate outcome\nof litigation. From time to time, even if it has substantial defenses, the Company considers isolated settlements\nbased on a variety of circumstances. The Company has accrued for these matters and will continue to monitor each\nrelated legal issue and adjust accruals as might be warranted based on new information and further developments in\naccordance with ASC 450-20-25, Contingencies. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to\ndefend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For certain of these matters, the\nCompany has accrued additional amounts such as estimated costs associated with settlements, damages and other\nlosses. Product liability accruals can represent projected product liability for thousands of claims around the\nworld, each in different litigation environments and with different fact patterns. Changes to the accruals may be\nrequired in the future as additional information becomes available.\nThe table below contains the most significant of these cases and provides the approximate number of plaintiffs in\nthe United States with direct claims in pending lawsuits regarding injuries allegedly due to the relevant product\nor product category as of June 30, 2024:\nProduct or product category                          Number of plaintiffs\nBody powders containing talc, primarily JOHNSON’S                          62,370\nBaby Powder\nDePuy ASR XL Acetabular System and DePuy ASR Hip                              160\nResurfacing System\nPINNACLE Acetabular Cup System                                                910\nPelvic meshes                                                               6,230\nETHICON PHYSIOMESH Flexible Composite Mesh                                    170\nRISPERDAL                                                                      20\nELMIRON                                                                     2,170\nThe number of pending lawsuits is expected to fluctuate as certain lawsuits are settled or dismissed and additional\nlawsuits are filed. There may be additional claims that have not yet been filed.\nForm 10-Q33\nTable of Contents\nMedTech\nDePuy ASR XL acetabular system and ASR Hip resurfacing system\nIn August 2010, DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. (DePuy) announced a worldwide voluntary recall of its ASR XL Acetabular\nSystem and DePuy ASR Hip Resurfacing System (ASR Hip) used in hip replacement surgery. Claims for personal injury\nhave been made against DePuy and the Company. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.\nLitigation has also been filed in countries outside of the United States, primarily in the United Kingdom, Canada,\nAustralia, Ireland, Germany, India and Italy. In November 2013, DePuy reached an agreement with a Court-appointed\ncommittee of lawyers representing ASR Hip plaintiffs to establish a program to settle claims with eligible ASR Hip\npatients in the United States who had surgery to replace their ASR Hips, known as revision surgery, as of August\n2013. DePuy reached additional agreements in February 2015 and March 2017, which further extended the settlement\nprogram to include ASR Hip patients who had revision surgeries after August 2013 and prior to February 15, 2017.\nThis settlement program has resolved more than 10,000claims, thereby bringing to resolution significant ASR Hip\nlitigation activity in the United States. However, lawsuits in the United States remain, and the settlement program\ndoes not address litigation outside of the United States. In Australia, a class action settlement was reached that\nresolved the claims of the majority of ASR Hip patients in that country. In Canada, the Company has reached\nagreements to settle the class actions filed in that country. The Company continues to receive information with\nrespect to potential additional costs associated with this recall on a worldwide basis. The Company has established\naccruals for the costs associated with the United States settlement program and ASR Hip-related product liability\nlitigation.\nDePuy PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System\nClaims for personal injury have also been made against DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc. and the Company (collectively,\nDePuy) relating to the PINNACLE Acetabular Cup System used in hip replacement surgery. Product liability lawsuits\ncontinue to be filed, and the Company continues to receive information with respect to potential costs and the\nanticipated number of cases. Most cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been organized as a\nmulti-district litigation in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas (Texas MDL).\nBeginning on June 1, 2022, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation ceased transfer of new cases into the\nTexas MDL, and there are now cases pending in federal court outside the Texas MDL. Litigation also has been filed\nin state courts and in countries outside of the United States. During the first quarter of 2019, DePuy established\na United States settlement program to resolve these cases. As part of the settlement program, adverse verdicts have\nbeen settled. The Company has established an accrual for product liability litigation associated with the PINNACLE\nAcetabular Cup System and the related settlement program.\nEthicon Pelvic Mesh\nClaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company arising out of Ethicon’s\npelvic mesh devices used to treat stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse. The Company continues to\nreceive information with respect to potential costs and additional cases. Cases filed in federal courts in the\nUnited States had been organized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of West Virginia. In March 2021, the MDL Court entered an order closing the MDL. The MDL Court\nhas remanded cases for trial to the jurisdictions where the case was originally filed and additional pelvic mesh\nlawsuits have been filed, and remain, outside of the MDL. The Company has settled or otherwise resolved the\nmajority of the United States cases and the estimated costs associated with these settlements and the remaining\ncases are reflected in the Company’s accruals. In addition, class actions and individual personal injury cases or\nclaims seeking damages for alleged injury resulting from Ethicon’s pelvic mesh devices have been commenced in\nvarious countries outside of the United States, including claims and cases in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands,\nand Ireland, and class actions in Israel, Australia, Canada and South Africa. The vast majority of these actions\nare now resolved. The Company has established accruals with respect to product liability litigation associated with\nEthicon’s pelvic mesh products.\nEthicon Physiomesh\nFollowing a June 2016 worldwide market withdrawal of Ethicon Physiomesh Flexible Composite Mesh (Physiomesh),\nclaims for personal injury have been made against Ethicon, Inc. (Ethicon) and the Company alleging personal injury\narising out of the use of this hernia mesh device. Cases filed in federal courts in the United States have been\norganized as a multi-district litigation (MDL) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of\nGeorgia. A multi-county litigation (MCL) also has been formed in New Jersey state court and assigned to Atlantic\nCounty for cases pending in New Jersey. In addition to the matters in the MDL and MCL, there are additional\nlawsuits pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio, which are part of the MDL\nfor polypropylene mesh devices manufactured by C.R. Bard, Inc., and lawsuits pending in two New Jersey MCLs formed\nfor Proceed/Proceed Ventral Patch and Prolene Hernia systems, and lawsuits pending outside the United States. In\nMay 2021, Ethicon and lead counsel for the plaintiffs entered into a term sheet to resolve approximately\n3,600Physiomesh cases (covering approximately 4,300plaintiffs) pending in the MDL and MCL at that time. A master\nsettlement agreement (MSA) was entered into\n34\nTable of Contents\nin September 2021 and includes 3,729cases in the MDL and MCL. Other than a small number of cases still pending in\nthe MDL, all Physiomesh matters in the United States have been resolved or are undergoing formal review for\npurposes of settlement.\nClaims have also been filed against Ethicon and the Company alleging personal injuries arising from the PROCEED\nMesh and PROCEED Ventral Patch hernia mesh products. In March 2019, the New Jersey Supreme Court entered an order\nconsolidating these cases pending in New Jersey as an MCL in Atlantic County Superior Court. Additional cases have\nbeen filed in various federal and state courts in the United States, and in jurisdictions outside the United\nStates.\nEthicon and the Company also have been subject to claims for personal injuries arising from the PROLENE\nPolypropylene Hernia System. In January 2020, the New Jersey Supreme Court created an MCL in Atlantic County\nSuperior Court to handle such cases.

Lawsuits primarily have been\nfiled in state courts in Pennsylvania, California, and Missouri. Other actions are pending in various courts in the\nUnited States and Canada. The Company continues to defend RISPERDAL product liability lawsuits, and continues to\nevaluate potential costs related to those claims. The Company has successfully defended a number of these cases but\nthere have been verdicts against the Company, including a verdict in October 2019 of $ 8.0billion of punitive\ndamages related to one plaintiff, which the trial judge reduced to $ 6.8million in January 2020. In September 2021,\nthe Company entered into a settlement in principle with the counsel representing plaintiffs in this matter and in\nsubstantially all of the outstanding cases in the United States.

These lawsuits, which allege that\nELMIRON contributes to the development of permanent retinal injury and vision loss, have been filed in both state\nand federal courts across the United States. In December 2020, lawsuits filed in federal courts in the United\nStates, including putative class action cases seeking medical monitoring, were organized as a multi-district\nlitigation in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey (MDL). In addition, cases have been\nfiled in various state courts of New Jersey, which have been coordinated in a multi-county litigation in Bergen\nCounty, as well as the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia, which have been coordinated and granted mass tort\ndesignation. In addition, three class action lawsuits have been filed in Canada. The Company continues to defend\nELMIRON product liability lawsuits and continues to evaluate potential costs related to those claims. Other than a\nsmall number of cases in the MDL filed by one law firm, all U.S. based ELMIRON matters have been resolved or are\nundergoing formal review for purposes of settlement. The Company has established accruals for defense and indemnity\ncosts associated with ELMIRON related product liability litigation.\nIntellectual Property\nCertain subsidiaries of the Company are subject, from time to time, to legal proceedings and claims related to\npatent, trademark and other intellectual property matters arising out of their businesses. Many of these matters\ninvolve challenges to the scope and/or validity of patents that relate to various products and allegations that\ncertain of the Company’s products infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties. Although these\nsubsidiaries believe that they have substantial defenses to these challenges and allegations with respect to all\nsignificant patents, there can be no assurance as to the outcome of these matters. A loss in any of these cases\ncould adversely affect the ability of these subsidiaries to sell their products, result in loss of sales due to\nloss of market exclusivity, require the payment of past damages and future royalties, and may result in a non-cash\nimpairment charge for any associated intangible asset.\nForm 10-Q35\nTable of Contents\nInnovative Medicine - litigation against filers of abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs)\nThe Company’s subsidiaries have brought lawsuits against generic companies that have filed ANDAs with the U.S. FDA\n(or similar lawsuits outside of the United States) seeking to market generic versions of products sold by various\nsubsidiaries of the Company prior to expiration of the applicable patents covering those products. These lawsuits\ntypically include allegations of non-infringement and/or invalidity of patents listed in FDA’s publication\n“Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations” (commonly known as the Orange Book). In each of\nthese lawsuits, the Company’s subsidiaries are seeking an order enjoining the defendant from marketing a generic\nversion of a product before the expiration of the relevant patents (Orange Book Listed Patents). In the event the\nCompany’s subsidiaries are not successful in an action, or any automatic statutory stay expires before the court\nrulings are obtained, the generic companies involved would have the ability, upon regulatory approval, to introduce\ngeneric versions of their products to the market, resulting in the potential for substantial market share and\nrevenue losses for the applicable products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment charge in any associated\nintangible asset. In addition, from time to time, the Company’s subsidiaries may settle these types of actions and\nsuch settlements can involve the introduction of generic versions of the products at issue to the market prior to\nthe expiration of the relevant patents.\nThe Inter Partes Review (IPR) process with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), created under the\n2011 America Invents Act, is also being used at times by generic companies in conjunction with ANDAs and lawsuits\nto challenge the applicable patents.\nXARELTO\nBeginning in March 2021, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Bayer Pharma AG; Bayer AG; and Bayer Intellectual Property\nGmbH filed patent infringement lawsuits in United States district courts against generic manufacturers who have\nfiled ANDAs seeking approval to market generic versions of XARELTO before expiration of certain Orange Book Listed\nPatents.

Sales of STELARA\n(ustekinumab) were driven by market growth partially offset by net unfavorable patient mix. Growth of TREMFYA\n(guselkumab) was due to market growth, share gains and favorable patient mix. Additionally, SIMPONI/SIMPONI ARIA\ngrowth was driven by growth outside the U.S. Lower sales of REMICADE (infliximab) were due to biosimilar\ncompetition.\nSales of STELARA in the United States were approximately $7.0 billion in fiscal 2023. Third parties have filed\nabbreviated Biologics License Applications with the FDA seeking approval to market biosimilar versions of STELARA.\nThe Company has settled certain litigation under the Biosimilar Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009. As a\nresult of these settlements and other agreements with separate third parties, the Company does not anticipate the\nlaunch of a biosimilar version of STELARA until January 1, 2025 in the United States. In July 2024, a biosimilar\nversion of STELARA launched in certain European markets for certain indications.\nBiosimilar versions of REMICADE have been introduced in the United States and certain markets outside the United\nStates and additional competitors continue to enter the market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition will\nresult in a further reduction in sales of REMICADE.\nInfectious disease products experienced an operational decline of 12.9% as compared to the same period a year ago\nprimarily driven by a decline in COVID-19 vaccine revenue. The Company does not anticipate any COVID-19 vaccine\nrevenue in the remainder of fiscal 2024.\nNeuroscience products achieved operational sales growth of 1.5% as compared to the same period a year ago. The\ngrowth of SPRAVATO (esketamine) was driven by increased physician and patient demand and ongoing launches. Growth\nwas partially offset by declines in Other Neuroscience.\nOncology products achieved operational sales growth of 18.6% as compared to the same period a year ago. Strong\nsales of DARZALEX (daratumumab) were driven by continued share gains in all regions and market growth. Growth of\nERLEADA (apalutamide) was due to continued share gains and market growth. Increased sales of CARVYKTI\n(ciltacabtagene autoleucel) were driven by continued share gains, capacity expansion and manufacturing\nefficiencies. Additionally, sales from the ongoing launch of TECVAYLI (teclistamab-cqyv) and the launch of TALVEY\n(talquetamab) and RYBREVANT (amivantamab) in Other Oncology contributed to the growth. Growth was partially offset\nby ZYTIGA (abiraterone acetate) due to loss of exclusivity and IMBRUVICA (ibrutinib) declines due to competitive\npressures.\nPulmonary Hypertension achieved operational sales growth of 9.4% as compared to the same period a year ago. Sales\ngrowth of OPSUMIT (macitentan) was driven by share gains and market growth partially offset by unfavorable mix in\nthe European Union. Sales growth of UPTRAVI (selexipag) was driven by market growth and share gains partially\noffset by inventory dynamics in the U.S.\nCardiovascular / Metabolism / Other products experienced an operational decline of 5.5% as compared to the same\nperiod a year ago. The decline of XARELTO (rivaroxaban) sales was primarily driven by unfavorable patient mix and\nshare loss.\nThe Company maintains a policy that no end customer will be permitted direct delivery of product to a location\nother than the billing location. This policy impacts contract pharmacy transactions involving non-grantee 340B\ncovered entities for most of the Company’s drugs, subject to multiple exceptions. Both grantee and non-grantee\ncovered entities can maintain certain contract pharmacy arrangements under policy exceptions. The Company has been\nand will continue to offer 340B discounts to covered entities on all of its covered outpatient drugs, and it\nbelieves its policy will improve its ability to identify inappropriate duplicate discounts and diversion prohibited\nby the 340B statute. The 340B Drug Pricing Program is a U.S. federal government program requiring drug\nmanufacturers to provide significant discounts on covered outpatient drugs to covered entities.\n46\nTable of Contents\nMedTech\nThe MedTech segment sales in the fiscal six months of 2024 were $15.8 billion, an increase of 3.3% as compared to\nthe same period a year ago, with an operational increase of 5.4% and a negative currency impact of 2.1%.

The pre-tax restructuring expense of $0.1 billion and $0.1 billion in the fiscal second quarter and\nfiscal six months of 2024, respectively, primarily included costs related to market and product exits. Total\nproject costs of approximately $0.4 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced.\nProvision for taxes on income\nThe worldwide effective income tax rate for the fiscal six months was 16.1% in 2024 and 2.7% in 2023.\nOn December 15, 2022, the European Union (EU) Member States formally adopted the EU’s Pillar Two Directive, which\ngenerally provides for a minimum effective tax rate of 15%, as established by the Organization for Economic Co-\noperation and Development (OECD) Pillar Two Framework that was supported by over 130 countries worldwide. As of\nDecember 31, 2023, several EU and non-EU countries have enacted Pillar Two legislation with an initial effective\ndate of January 1, 2024, with other aspects of the law effective in 2025 or later. The Company is estimating that\nas a total result of this legislation the 2024 effective tax rate will increase by approximately 1.0 to 1.5%\ncompared to fiscal 2023. Further legislation, guidance and regulations that may be issued in fiscal 2024, as well\nas other business events, may impact this estimate.\nAs discussed in Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Company\nacquired Yellow Jersey, a demerged subsidiary of Numab Therapeutics, to secure the global rights to NM26, a\nbispecific antibody compound and will record a related $1.25 billion non-tax-deductible expense in the third fiscal\nquarter of 2024. Since this acquisition is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes this charge will be a\nfactor for a higher effective tax rate for the remainder of fiscal 2024.\nFor further details related to the 2024 provision for taxes refer to Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial\nStatements.\nLiquidity and capital resources\nAcquisitions\n(net of cash acquired)\nProceeds from the disposal of\nassets/businesses, net\nDividends to shareholders\nForm 10-Q55\nTable of Contents\nCash flows\nCash and cash equivalents were $24.9 billion at the end of the fiscal second quarter of 2024 as compared with $21.9\nbillion at the end of fiscal year 2023.

Furthermore, in September 2023, the Company secured a new 364-day Credit\nFacility of $10 billion (expiration on September 5, 2024) which may be used for general corporate purposes\nincluding to support our commercial paper borrowings. Interest charged on borrowings under the credit line\nagreement is based on either Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Reference Rate or other applicable market rate\nas allowed plus applicable margins. Commitment fees under the agreement are not material.\nAs of June 30, 2024, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $25.5\nbillion and had approximately $41.5 billion of notes payable and long-term debt for a net debt position of $16.0\nbillion as compared to the prior year fiscal second quarter net debt position of $17.1 billion (which included cash\nof $1.2 billion and debt of $8.4 billion related to Kenvue). In the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company\nissued senior unsecured notes for a total of $6.7 billion. For additional details on borrowings, see Note 4 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements. The net proceeds from this offering were used to fund the Shockwave acquisition\nwhich closed on May 31, 2024, and for general corporate purposes. The Company anticipates that operating cash\nflows, the ability to raise funds from external sources, borrowing capacity from existing committed credit\nfacilities and access to the commercial paper markets will continue to provide sufficient resources to fund\noperating needs, including the Company’s remaining balance to be paid on the agreement to settle opioid litigation\nfor approximately $1.5 billion and the approximately $10.6 billion ($12.8 billion nominal) reserve remaining for\nthe talc settlement proposal (See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details). In\naddition, the Company monitors the global capital markets on an ongoing basis and from time to time may raise\ncapital when market conditions are favorable.\nIn the fiscal second quarter of 2024, the Company paid approximately $3.1 billion to the U.S. Treasury including\n$2.0 billion related to the current installment due on foreign undistributed earnings as part of the TCJA charge\n(see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal\nyear ended December 31, 2023) and $1.1 billion primarily related to the normal estimated payment for the first six\nmonths of fiscal 2024. Additionally, the Company paid $1.1 billion in income related taxes net of refunds to\nforeign jurisdictions in the first six months of fiscal 2024.\nDividends\nOn April 16, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on June 4,\n2024, to shareholders of record as of May 21, 2024.\nOn July 17, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a regular cash dividend of $1.24 per share, payable on September\n10, 2024, to shareholders of record as of August 27, 2024. The Company expects to continue the practice of paying\nregular quarterly cash dividends.\nForm 10-Q57\nTable of Contents\nOther information\nNew accounting pronouncements\nRefer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for new accounting pronouncements.\nEconomic and market factors\nIn July 2023, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) filed litigation against the U.S. Department of Health and\nHuman Services as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services challenging the constitutionality of the\nInflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) Medicare Drug Price Negotiation Program. The litigation requests a declaration that\nthe IRA violates Janssen’s rights under the First Amendment and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution and\ntherefore that Janssen is not subject to the IRA’s mandatory pricing scheme. In April 2024, Janssen appealed the\ndistrict court’s denial of its summary judgment motion to the Third Circuit.\nRussia-Ukraine war\nAlthough the long-term implications of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal six months ending June 30, 2024, and the fiscal year ending December\n31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Russian subsidiaries represented less than 1% of both Company’s\nconsolidated assets and revenues. The Company does not maintain Ukraine subsidiaries subsequent to the Kenvue\nseparation.\nIn March of 2022, the Company took steps to suspend all advertising, enrollment in clinical trials, and any\nadditional investment in Russia. The Company continues to supply products relied upon by patients for healthcare\npurposes.\nConflict in the Middle East\nAlthough the long-term implications of the conflict in the Middle East are difficult to predict at this time, the\nfinancial impact of the conflict in the fiscal second quarter of 2024, including accounts receivable or inventory\nreserves, was not material. As of the fiscal six months ending June 30, 2024, and the fiscal year ending December\n31, 2023, the business of the Company’s Israel subsidiaries represented approximately 1% of the Company’s\nconsolidated assets and represented less than 1% of revenues.\nOther Macroeconomic Considerations\nThe Company operates in certain countries where the economic conditions continue to present significant challenges.\nThe Company continues to monitor these situations and take appropriate actions. Inflation rates and currency\nexchange rates continue to have an effect on worldwide economies and, consequently, on the way the Company\noperates. The Company has accounted for operations in Venezuela, Argentina and Turkey as highly inflationary, as\nthe prior three-year cumulative inflation rate surpassed 100%. In the face of increasing costs, the Company strives\nto maintain its profit margins through cost reduction programs, productivity improvements and periodic price\nincreases.\nGovernments around the world consider various proposals to make changes to tax laws, which may include increasing\nor decreasing existing statutory tax rates. In connection with various government initiatives, companies are\nrequired to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater\naudit scrutiny of profits earned in other countries. A change in statutory tax rate in any country would result in\nthe revaluation of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities related to that particular jurisdiction in the\nperiod in which the new tax law is enacted. This change would result in an expense or benefit recorded to the\nCompany’s Consolidated Statement of Earnings. The Company closely monitors these proposals as they arise in the\ncountries where it operates. Changes to the statutory tax rate may occur at any time, and any related expense or\nbenefit recorded may be material to the fiscal quarter and year in which the law change is enacted.\nThe Company faces various worldwide health care changes that may continue to result in pricing pressures that\ninclude health care cost containment and government legislation relating to sales, promotions and reimbursement of\nhealth care products.\nChanges in the behavior and spending patterns of purchasers of healthcare products and services, including delaying\nmedical procedures, rationing prescription medications, reducing the frequency of physician visits and foregoing\nhealthcare insurance coverage, as a result of the current global economic downturn, may continue to impact the\nCompany’s businesses.\nThe Company faces regular intellectual property challenges from third parties, including generic and biosimilar\nmanufacturers, seeking to manufacture and market generic and biosimilar versions of key pharmaceutical products\nprior to the expiration of the\n58\nTable of Contents\napplicable patents. These challengers file Abbreviated New Drug Applications or abbreviated Biologics License\nApplications with the FDA or otherwise challenged the coverage and/or validity of the Company’s patents. In the\nevent the Company is not successful in defending the patent claims challenged in the resulting lawsuits, generic or\nbiosimilar versions of the products at issue may be introduced to the market, resulting in the potential for\nsubstantial market share and revenue losses for those products, and which may result in a non-cash impairment\ncharge in any associated intangible asset. There is also risk that one or more competitors could launch a generic\nor biosimilar version of the product at issue following regulatory approval even though one or more valid patents\nare in place.\nForm 10-Q59\nTable of Contents",
