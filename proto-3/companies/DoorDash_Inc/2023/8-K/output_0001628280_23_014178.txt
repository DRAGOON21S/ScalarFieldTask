Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Certain Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Certain Officers;
Compensatory Arrangements of Certain Officers.
On April 25, 2023, Stan Meresman informed DoorDash, Inc. (the “ Company ”) that he will retire and not stand for
re-election as a member of the Company’s board of directors (the “ Board ”) at the Company’s 2023 annual meeting of
stockholders (the “ 2023 Annual Meeting ”). Mr. Meresman will continue to serve on the Board and as the Chair of
the audit committee of the Board until the expiration of his current term at the end of the 2023 Annual Meeting.
Mr. Meresman’s decision to not stand for re-election does not arise from any disagreement with management on any
matter relating to the Company’s operations, policies, or practices. Mr. Meresman announced his decision at this
time so that the nominating and corporate governance committee of the Board could make its recommendations for, and
the Board could approve, nominees to the Board in advance of the conclusion of his term. The Company greatly
appreciates Mr. Meresman’s long and dedicated service as a director and wishes him the best in his retirement.
In connection with Mr. Meresman’s departure, the Board appointed Elinor Mertz, a current member of the audit
committee, as Chair of the audit committee effective as of the 2023 Annual Meeting.
