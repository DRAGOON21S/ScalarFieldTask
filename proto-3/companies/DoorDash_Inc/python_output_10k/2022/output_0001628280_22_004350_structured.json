          "content": "Item 1. Business\nOUR BUSINESS\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to achieve this by providing a logistics and technology\nplatform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ modern expectations of ease and immediacy.\nOur business consists of our Marketplace and Platform Services. We built our Marketplace to serve the needs of\nthree key constituents: merchants, consumers and Dashers. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online\npresence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand\nthrough delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers. As part\nof our Marketplace, we offer merchants a broad array of services that enable them to solve mission-critical\nchallenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment\nprocessing, and customer support. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our platform in order to\nacquire new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nOur Marketplace provides a platform for over 25 million monthly active users (\"MAU\") 1 to discover, engage with,\nand purchase goods from merchants in their community. Our aim is to consistently improve our consumer value\nproposition by increasing the quantity and variety of merchants that are available on our Marketplace, while also\nimproving the level of convenience, quality, and service we provide. Marketplace also includes DashPass, our\nmembership program which aims to improve affordability and lower transactional friction by reducing the delivery\nand service fees we charge consumers.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our revenue today, our Platform Services\nbusiness, which primarily consists of Drive and Storefront, offers services to help merchants facilitate sales\nthrough their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand\nthey have generated through their own channels using our local logistics platform. Storefront enables merchants to\ncreate their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-\ndemand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nFor Dashers, both our Marketplace and Platform Services provide opportunities for those looking for accessible and\nflexible ways to earn and achieve their goals. Dashers choose when and where to dash, as well as how frequently and\nfor how long to dash each time they choose to do so. We provide earnings transparency so that Dashers can make\ninformed decisions about the deliveries they choose to make.\nWe believe our business benefits only when we provide attractive services for each of our three key constituents:\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. Consequently, in order to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with\na growing suite of services that help them build and grow their businesses; consumers with a broad selection of\nmerchants to choose from, consistent and high quality experiences, and affordability that drives increased\nadoption; and Dashers with an attractive combination of accessibility, choice, and earning opportunity that\ncompetes effectively for their time.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the scale\nof our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services that\nenable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants available,\nthe quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability. We believe that we are\npositioned favorably based on the combination of merchant selection, experience, and value we provide.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our\nplatform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, and earnings potential. We believe that\nwe are well-positioned based on the limited requirements necessary to qualify, the density of our network, the\nimproving efficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.\n1 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplace in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2021.\n6\nTable of Contents\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive.\nIn the United States, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Grubhub\n(acquired by Just Eat Takeaway in June 2021), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants\nthat have their own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems, other\nmerchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocery delivery services, traditional grocers, and\ncompanies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand our\npresence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In addition, we\ncompete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that\nmerchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract\nconsumers. With Drive, and as we continue to expand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete\nwith large Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and Google.\nWe believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution\nhave allowed us to quickly extend our network and geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to expand\nwithin our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information about\nthe risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nBusiness and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had over 8,600 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of\nour employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our\nemployee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social\nprogress. In 2021, over 6 million people dashed 2 , earning a total of over $11 billion. Dashers worked an average\nof less than four active hours per week throughout the year.\nWe believe choice and access are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an\nopportunity to earn incremental income in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors,\nwe must compete for their time and effort with every order. We compete against other earning opportunities as well\nas alternative uses of time like leisure. Because of this competition, we must provide earnings opportunities that\nare attractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices available. Specifically, we strive to make dashing\npositive based on:\nAccessibility : We believe the barriers-to-entry in dashing are very low. Prospective Dashers must pass a\nbackground check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or car. People who qualify to become\nDashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up. We know of no other earning\nopportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\nFlexibility : Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash\nfor, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earning needs. It also allows\nDashers to generate earnings around the other commitments they have in their lives, which often include full or\npart-time jobs, school, parenting or commitments to care for family or friends.\n2 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past year,\nmeasured as of December 31, 2021.\n7\nTable of Contents\nEarnings : Dashers dash in order to earn income, so we must provide earnings that are competitive with\nalternative opportunities and commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of\nearnings, we provide tools that improve immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by\nDashers.\nService : We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is\naccessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and\npractices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur mission to grow and empower local economies creates a culture that promotes progress in all of our stakeholder\nrelationships. Just as importantly, our business cannot thrive, or even survive, without Dashers. As a result, our\nbusiness and financial ambitions are well aligned with our goal to make dashing an attractive and incremental\nearning opportunity that promotes social progress by giving people more choice in how they achieve their financial\ngoals.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ncities we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the\ntalent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the\nvoices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the tools, resources,\nand opportunities to succeed.\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\nElevate\nElevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company.\nThe year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership\nteam, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.\nWomen’s Leadership Forum\nOur Women’s Leadership Forum equips mid- to senior-level technical women with skills to thrive in our workplace.\nThis six-month program happens once a year and includes classroom-style learning, one-on-one coaching, and group\nroundtables. Members of our management team actively participate in the forum.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (\"ERGs\"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We\ncurrently have eight ERGs: Black@DoorDash, Latinx@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash (LGBTQIA+),\nAAPI@DoorDash (Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders), Veterans@DoorDash, Indigenous@DoorDash, and\nParents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2021, we had 250 issued U.S. patents, 53 U.S. patent applications pending, and 25 patent applications pending in a\nforeign jurisdiction. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of\nnew intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2021, we held 37 registered trademarks in the United States and\n73 registered\n8\nTable of Contents\ntrademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending\ntrademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names\nfor websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and\ncost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the\nfuture or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third\nparties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and reputation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.”\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws,\nregulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, commissions and fees,\nanti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product\nliability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, membership services, intellectual property,\nconsumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data protection, data security, competition,\nunionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service,\nmobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. The sale and delivery of\ngoods through our platform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety, alcohol,\ntobacco, cannabidiol, pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, hazardous substances, and the interstate and\nintrastate transport of goods. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many\ncases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over\ntime through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing\nbodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.\nSee the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and\nRegulatory Environment—If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and\nRegulatory Environment—Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, many of\nwhich are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to\nclaims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to\nlegal claims,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties—We primarily rely on a third-\nparty payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small number of third-party payment\nprocessors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third party\nand other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected,” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our\nbusiness associated with such laws and regulations.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nWe were incorporated in 2013 as Palo Alto Delivery Inc., a Delaware corporation.

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\npart or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future;\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nIf Dashers in the United States are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, or if we fail to comply\nwith Proposition 22 in the State of California, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and failure by them to maintain their\nservice levels or any changes to their operating costs could adversely affect our business;\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business;\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand the costs of complying with such laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations,\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue,\nTotal Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline\nas the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic wane;\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (the \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n11\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nThe proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\") will not be completed unless the conditions are satisfied or\nwaived. If the Transaction is not completed, our and Wolt’s future business and financial results could be\nnegatively affected;\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt may subject us to certain liabilities associated with Wolt or\nliabilities that may arise in connection with the completion of the Transaction; and\nOur and Wolt’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the\nTransaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and Wolt's results of operations, cash flows, and financial\nposition;\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets and geographies;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment of new features and services;\nhire, integrate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may\nnot be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nWe have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced\nby growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding\nthese risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do\nnot address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nAlthough we generated net income of $23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, we have incurred net\nlosses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve profitability again, or maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $667\nmillion, $461 million, and $468 million in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively, and, as\nof December 31, 2020, and 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. We\nexpect our costs will increase\n12\nTable of Contents\nover time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our\nbusiness and operating as a public company. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial\nand other resources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring\nnew platform features and services, expanding into new markets and geographies, and increasing our sales and\nmarketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or\ngrowth in our business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and\nother expenses could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent\nbasis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increases in our expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2021, we\nhave $1.9 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity\nawards. Additionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs.\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\nlosses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our recent revenue growth rate, growth in demand\nfor our offerings, and financial performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. For the\nyears ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, our revenue was $885 million, $2.9 billion, and $4.9 billion,\nrespectively, representing a 226% and 69% year-over-year growth rate, respectively. In addition, with the COVID-19\npandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. The circumstances\nthat accelerated the growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to\ncontinue, and we expect growth in consumer demand and our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates\nto decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021. You should not rely on our revenue or key\nbusiness metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key\nbusiness metrics, or key business metrics growth in future periods. In particular, our revenue growth rate has\nfluctuated in prior periods. We expect our revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate over the short term and\ndecline in the long term. Our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020\nand 2021 as the size of our business grows and as we achieve higher market adoption rates. We may also experience\ndeclines in our revenue growth rate as a result of a number of factors, including slowing demand for our platform,\ninsufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing\ncompetition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to continue to capitalize on growth\nopportunities, increasing regulatory costs, and the maturation of our business, among others. We also expect to\ncontinue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may not result in increased\nrevenue or growth. In addition, we have strategically focused on suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas\nsince our founding because of the opportunity that these markets have presented for our local logistics platform.\nIf the demand for local logistics platforms does not continue to grow in these markets, or if we are unable to\nmaintain our category share in these markets, our revenue growth rate could be adversely affected. If our revenue\ngrowth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United\nStates, we compete with other local food delivery logistics companies, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub (acquired by Just\nEat Takeaway in June 2021), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have their own\nonline ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems, other merchants that own and\noperate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale\nsolutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with\nlarge Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and Google. Further, as\nwe continue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these\nmarkets. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone,\nand paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local\npublications to attract consumers. Changing traditional ordering habits is difficult,\n13\nTable of Contents\nand if merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to local food delivery logistics as we expect, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and larger existing user bases in certain markets, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. Greater financial\nresources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly to new or\nemerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less\nattractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic\nmarket, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and\nsupply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less\nappealing to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic\nrelationships among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, Uber acquired Postmates in\nDecember 2020, and Just Eat Takeaway, a European local logistics platform, acquired Grubhub in June 2021, and Lyft\nannounced a partnership with Grubhub that allows Lyft’s loyalty-program members free delivery from Grubhub\nrestaurants. In addition, certain of our competitors have acquired kitchens to enable them to produce and deliver\nfood directly to consumers. Our competitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and\nperformance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than ours.\nAdditionally, many of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission\nrates and consumer fees, incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services and consumer\ndiscounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, which may be more\nattractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission\nrates and fees or maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions in order to remain competitive,\nparticularly in markets where we do not have a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will\ncontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be\nsuccessful. Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of\nfunding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These\ninvestments, along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to\nlower their prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more\neffectively against us. Delivery logistics services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are\nnascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost effective to\ndevelop their own platforms to offer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIn addition, within our industry, the cost to switch between offerings is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift\nto the lowest-cost provider and could use more than one local logistics platform, independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local logistics platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may\nadopt certain of our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more\nhighly than ours, which would render our platform less attractive and reduce our ability to differentiate our\nplatform. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from\nthe use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow\nour platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in\nnew markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers\nattracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or than it has grown\nin the past. In particular, our national brand partnerships are a key component of our strategy to provide a wide\nselection for consumers. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants\nand our national brand partners, or\n14\nTable of Contents\nconsumers, the value of our network would be diminished. In addition, we expect to continue to incur substantial\nexpenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to acquire\nadditional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may invest\nsignificant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for several\nyears or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately\nexceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Based on the type of partner agreement, partner merchants may terminate\ntheir agreements with us by providing us at least seven (7) or thirty (30) days advance notice and such agreements\ndo not generally provide for any exclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements\nwith us, the merchant selection available on our local logistics platform could be adversely affected. Changes to\nour business and to our relationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and\nretain other constituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership product, DashPass, and how\ncompelling this offering is to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to DashPass.\nAdditionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as\ndiscounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such\nconsumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of DashPass, through\nprompts and notifications and time-limited trials of DashPass and other offerings. However, these consumers may\nnever convert to a paid membership to DashPass or access our platform after they take advantage of our promotions.\nIf we are not able to continue to expand our consumer base or fail to convert our consumers to regular paying\nconsumers, demand for our full-price or paid services, such as DashPass, and our revenue may grow slower than\nexpected or decline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites\nand applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and\napplications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If\nconsumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than\nthrough our website and consumer mobile application directly, our ability to establish relationships and build\nbrand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized\nexperience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract\nand retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. To attract and retain\nDashers, we have, among other things, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, such as credits to be used for\norders on our platform, free DoorDash-branded apparel, and access to Dasher Experience Centers where Dashers can\nreceive assistance with pressing issues, meet other Dashers, and participate in special events. If we do not\ncontinue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income, and other\nincentive programs that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, we may fail to attract new Dashers\nor retain existing Dashers or increase their use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative\npublicity, or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, if\nmerchants and consumers choose to use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to\nearn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers.\nWe also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these\nincentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers or\ncould have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including\nimmigration and labor and employment laws, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in\nincreased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our\ncontrol, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers\nthat utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. Our agreements with Dashers generally remain in\neffect until terminated by Dashers or us. Dashers may terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least\nseven (7) days advance notice and such agreements do not provide for any exclusivity. If we fail to attract Dashers\nor retain existing Dashers on\n15\nTable of Contents\nfavorable terms, if we fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, or if Dashers terminate their\nagreements with us, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, either as a result of increased\noperating costs, or to offset the commission we charge, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform, including small and local independent businesses, to provide quality goods to\nour consumers at expected price points. If these merchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand,\nproducing quality goods at affordable prices, or meeting our other requirements or standards, or experience\nproblems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, our reputation and brand could be damaged. Further, an\nincrease in merchant operating costs could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission\nrates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our operational costs and efficiency, and if\nmerchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide\nconsumers with sufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform.\nMany of the factors affecting merchant operating costs, including off-premise costs and prices, are beyond the\ncontrol of merchants and include inflation, costs associated with the goods provided, labor and employee benefit\ncosts, rent costs, and energy costs. If merchants pass along these increased operating costs and increase prices on\nour platform, order volume may decline. Additionally, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “ Risk Factors ”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nour business mix between Marketplace and Drive;\nthe proportion of consumers that are members of DashPass;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe seasonality of our business, particularly with respect to local food delivery logistics, including the effect\nof academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nthe impact of weather on our business;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\n16\nTable of Contents\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe attraction and engagement of qualified employees and key personnel;\nour ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service providers;\nthe effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior and our order\nvolumes, as well as the impact of changes in the response of governments and private industry to COVID-19;\nthe impact that price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms imposed by various jurisdictions, and\nany associated increase in the fees we charge to consumers, have on our operating results;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems\nare not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our\nbusiness interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions\nin our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time\nto time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These\nsystem failures generally occur either as a result of software updates being deployed with unexpected errors or as\na result of temporary infrastructure failures related to storage, network, or compute capacity being exhausted.\nThese events have resulted in losses in revenue, though such losses have not been material to date. System failures\nin the future could result in significant losses of revenue. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided\ncredits to consumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar\nevent, including for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may\nvoluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, the affected user could seek monetary recourse\nfrom us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful,\nwould likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to\nidentify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged\ninterruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform\ncould adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\n17\nTable of Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total\nOrders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline as\nthe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic wane.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has globally resulted in loss of life, business closures, restrictions on travel,\nand widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or recovery from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Factors that may\nimpact our business include:\nnew information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease;\nthe duration and spread of the outbreak;\nthe severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary\nbusiness closures;\nregulatory actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant\npricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings;\nother business disruptions that affect our workforce;\nthe availability of effective vaccines and the speed at which they can be administered to the public;\nthe continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19;\nthe impact on capital and financial markets;\nactions taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or\ntreat its impact, and;\npotential changes to consumer behavior or spending patterns as markets recover.\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed many of our employees to work remotely, which may impact\nproductivity and otherwise disrupt our business operations. In addition, the current outbreak of COVID-19 has\nresulted in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and financial markets, and\nsimilar public health threats could do so in the future. Such events have impacted, and could in the future impact,\ndemand for merchants and consumer purchase patterns, which in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and results\nof operations.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace\nGOV due to increased consumer demand for delivery, more merchants using our platform to facilitate both delivery\nand take-out, and improved efficiency of our local logistics platform. The circumstances that have accelerated the\ngrowth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue, and we expect\nour revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline in future periods compared to growth rates\nin 2020 and 2021.\nFurthermore, if a virus or other disease is transmitted by human contact, as is the case with COVID-19, our\nemployees and any constituent of our network may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid any\ncontact with others, any of which may adversely affect our ability to provide our platform and for merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers to use our platform. In addition, shelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact\nmerchants’ ability to operate their businesses, consumers’ ability to pick up orders, and Dashers’ ability to make\ndeliveries during certain times, or at all. Viruses or other diseases transmitted by human contact may in the\nfuture cause a temporary closure of merchants’ businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary\npreventative measures, and many of our merchants may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their\nbusinesses, and may be forced to go out of business. Even if merchants are able to continue to operate their\nbusinesses, many may operate with limited hours, menus, and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or\ndisruptions or closures of merchants’ businesses could impact the selection available on our platform, disrupt our\nability to operate our local logistics platform, and adversely affect our business.\nEven if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived\nrisk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Merchants may be perceived as\nunsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our\nplatform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar\npublic health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform\nwould be adversely affected. Any negative impact on consumers’ willingness or ability to order delivery or complete\na Pickup order, or on Dashers’ willingness or ability to make deliveries, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\n18\nTable of Contents\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely\nto also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “ Risk Factors” section.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms will\nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic, over fifty (50) jurisdictions across the United States, including many jurisdictions in California, have\nimplemented temporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative\nproposals to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals\nto be made. In addition, some jurisdictions have enacted permanent price controls, including San Francisco,\nCalifornia, New York, New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Minneapolis, Minnesota (although the latter two\njurisdictions’ price restrictions do not apply when certain conditions are met). We filed litigation challenging\nthe San Francisco and New York price controls as unconstitutional and in excess of each respective jurisdiction’s\npolice power. There are legislative proposals in additional jurisdictions to make price controls on food delivery\nlogistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be made in the future. These price controls\nhave had in the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These\nprice controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers,\nthough we are aware of a few jurisdictions that have adopted limits or explicit prohibitions against doing so in\nconnection with price controls. An increase in the fees we charge to consumers could result in reduced demand for\nour services by consumers. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or\ncollect such increased consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as\nconfusing and/or misleading to consumers. Although temporary price controls in some jurisdictions in which we\noperate have expired, with the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect existing price controls to\npersist in the near term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If\nany of these events occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory\nscrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which\ncreates additional challenges to managing our business. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future\noffer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies\nthat enable them to attract or retain new merchants, consumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be\nno assurance that we will not be forced, through competition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of\ndelivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform, or further reduce the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have launched, and may in the future\nlaunch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as membership products like DashPass, and Dasher or consumer\nloyalty programs, or modify existing pricing methodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are\npresented on our platform, any of which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants,\nconsumers, or Dashers or which may result in lower commissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. For example, on April 27, 2021, we changed our merchant pricing\nmodels to better support certain U.S. restaurant partners, including by offering them a choice of three different\ndelivery commission rates tied to varying levels of marketing support and services. Further, our consumers’ price\nsensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to\ncompete effectively in these locations. In particular, our continued international expansion may require us to\nchange our pricing strategies and to adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing\nand gratuities. While we do and will attempt to set prices based on our prior operating experience and merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher feedback and engagement levels, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in\nthe technology used in our pricing and we could be underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the\nservices on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay model for Dashers.\nOur pay model for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to\nlead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under our former\nDasher pay model, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little\nor no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile,\nit also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being\nreceived by Dashers.\n19\nTable of Contents\nGovernment authorities have also brought claims against us related to our former Dasher pay model and may bring\nsimilar claims in the future. For example, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the\nSuperior Court of the District of Columbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection\nProcedures Act with respect to our former Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent\norder and judgment to resolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former Dasher pay model\nfrom other government authorities in the future.\nThe incorrect understanding or perception of our former Dasher pay model by some led, and may continue to lead, to\nsome consumers providing lower tips, or no tips at all, to Dashers, which could impact the amount that Dashers are\nable to earn on our platform and our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We have also launched, and may in the\nfuture launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that utilize our platform, which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers. For example, in September 2019, we changed our Dasher\npay model to include (i) a base pay amount for each order, which depends on the estimated time, distance, and\ndesirability of the order, (ii) promotions for orders that meet certain conditions, including bonuses for Dashers\nwho meet specific goals, and (iii) tips from consumers, which Dashers receive 100% of on top of base pay and\npromotions.\nWe increased the amount we pay to Dashers per order when we changed to our current pay model, but our current\nDasher pay model may also cause less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some cases. Further, this pay\nmodel may lead to negative publicity related to perceptions of the complexity of the pay model, inconsistency in\nearnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the future, based on a variety of\nfactors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may change our pay model again. Our current pay model, and any\nfuture changes to our pay model or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an\nincrease to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain\nconsumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that\nDashers may be reclassified as employees under federal or state law. As discussed further below, we have been\ninvolved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such\nproceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West,\nInc.v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”), including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June 2020.\nIn addition, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to\ndetermine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law by\nGovernor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex\nstandard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along\nwith certain other companies, supported a campaign for a 2020 ballot initiative (“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5\nand preserve flexibility for Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in\nDecember 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court in California issued an order finding\nthat the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based\nDrivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 have filed notices of appeal to the\nCalifornia Court of Appeal. Proposition 22 remains in effect pending further court proceedings. Under Proposition\n22, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are now applicable to us and\nDashers in California and our costs related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these\nincreased costs, we do in certain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower\norder volumes over time and adversely impact our results of operations. In addition, several jurisdictions where we\noperate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or\nother legislative processes in certain jurisdictions, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new\nprotections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other\nstakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that Dashers perform. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt\nsuch legislation, or we propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives or other legislative processes in\ncertain jurisdictions, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could\nexperience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such\nlaws, and our results of operations would be adversely impacted. For example, we, along with certain other\ncompanies, app-based drivers, and community groups, are supporting a campaign for a 2022 ballot initiative in\nMassachusetts that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits for Dashers in\nMassachusetts. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation\ncould still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California\nSuperior Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County Superior\nCourt’s order noted above (which is being appealed), and similar challenges may also be filed. In addition, we\ncould face further challenges to the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors\nas other states where we operate are considering adopting similar legislation or regulations. A reclassification of\nDashers or delivery service providers using a local logistics platform as\n20\nTable of Contents\nemployees could require us to revise our pricing methodologies and pay model to account for such a change to Dasher\nclassification, and to make other substantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a Dasher to an\nemployment position, which would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our\ngoals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term.\nThese decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the\nlong-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. For example,\nemployee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquarters and in a number of our offices across the\nUnited States and internationally. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on\nmanagement and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our failure to implement and maintain effective\ninternal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that\ncould result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could cause a decline in the price of our\nClass A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure in order to\nmanage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nA majority of our employees have been with us for fewer than twenty-four (24) months. We have made, and intend to\ncontinue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and sales and marketing\ninfrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies, and\nacquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial\ninfrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new employees,\nwhile maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge our ability to develop\nand improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures,\nrecruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not\nmanage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and the efficiency of our\noperations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more\nimportant as competition in our industry further intensifies. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing\nour reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the success of our\nmarketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our ability to\nsuccessfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” mark, our logo, and other trademarks\nimportant to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe\nthat our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives\nnew consumer growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our\nconsumers have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local logistics platforms and\nservices, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our consumer base, we must appeal\nto new consumers who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local logistics\nplatforms.\n21\nTable of Contents\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Negative\nperception of our platform or company may harm our reputation, brand, and local network effects, including as a\nresult of:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform,\nDashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including Dasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nfraud;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or to pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission, or not clearly articulated;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but\nnegatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance\nthe interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely\naffect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n22\nTable of Contents\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, pay\nmodel, user support, technology, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues, privacy or security\npractices, management team or the safety of Dashers, merchants and consumers using our platform could adversely\naffect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and\nloyalty of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage\nrelated to the manner in which Dashers were compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related\nto food tampering and general food safety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers and\nmerchants using our platform, which has adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to\nscale and public awareness of our brand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an\namplified negative effect on our reputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands or\ninfluencers that we have partnered with may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to\nus. Any negative publicity that we may receive could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which\ncould adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our\nbrand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive\nand proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary\ndata relating to our business, such as our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our employees. An\nincreasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large\nInternet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their\ninformation security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated\nand highly targeted attacks. In addition, these incidents could originate on our vendors’ platforms, vendors’\nsystems, or with our vendors’ personnel, which could then be leveraged to access our website, platforms, and\nproprietary data, including personal data. We and our vendors have previously experienced these types of breaches\nand other incidents. For example, in September 2019, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors that\nresulted in the unauthorized acquisition of certain Dashers’ driver licenses as well as data related to certain of\nour consumers. This incident has resulted in regulatory inquiries and is the subject of litigation. To date, this\nincident has not resulted in a material loss of revenue or the incurrence of material expenses. We have undertaken\nsteps to enhance our data security and governance program, which include adding additional protective security\nlayers around the data, improving security protocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside\nexpertise to increase our ability to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of\nthe incident have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or similar incidents. While we\nmaintain cyber insurance that may help provide coverage for these types of incidents, we cannot assure you that our\ninsurance will be adequate to cover costs and liabilities related to this incident or to any incidents which may\noccur in the future. In addition, in December 2021, a vulnerability in a popular logging software, Log4j, was\npublicly announced. If left unpatched, the Log4j vulnerability could be exploited to allow unauthorized actors to\nexecute code remotely on a system using Log4j. We have taken steps to ensure these vulnerabilities have been\npatched in our systems, but we cannot guarantee that all vulnerabilities have been patched in every system upon\nwhich we are dependent or that additional critical vulnerabilities of Log4j or other open-source software upon\nwhich we rely will not be discovered.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and\nmay not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate or\nprevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we and our vendors\nmay face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, security breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities\nused in our business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or\nthose of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, attempting to fraudulently induce our\nemployees, merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card\ninformation, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology, or IT,\nsystems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, or others into manipulating payment\ninformation, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. Moreover, with many of our employees and\ncontractors and many employees and contractors of vendors currently working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe may be exposed to increased risks of security breaches or incidents.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to\nour systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches\nexperienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are\nbecoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to\nidentify and prevent. We have previously experienced incidents of fraud on our platform that we believe involve\ncredential stuffing attacks, which we have been unable to detect or prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored\nor supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect,\nremediate, and otherwise respond to.\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect the personal data of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, protect our systems, prevent data loss, and prevent other\nsecurity breaches and security incidents, these security measures have not fully protected our systems in the past\nand cannot guarantee security in the future. The IT and infrastructure used in our business may be vulnerable to\ncyberattacks, viruses, social engineering, bugs, defects, vulnerabilities, denial of service, credential stuffing,\nransomware and other malware and malicious code, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption or\ninterruption of such IT and infrastructure, or security breaches or incidents, and unauthorized parties may be able\nto access data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers, our employees’ personal data, or our other sensitive and proprietary data, accessible through those\nsystems. Although we have policies restricting the access to the personal data we store, there is a risk that these\npolicies may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy, or any actual or perceived\nsecurity breach or other incidents, could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable,\nresult in loss or improper access to, unavailability of, acquisition, disclosure, modification or other processing\nof, data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, damage our\nrelationships with third-party partners, or result in claims, regulatory investigations, and proceedings and\nsignificant legal, regulatory, and financial exposure, including ongoing monitoring by regulators, and any such\nincidents or any perception that our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or\nDasher confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nAny actual or perceived breach of privacy or security, or other security incident, impacting any entities with\nwhich we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers and vendors) could\nhave similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security measures is limited. There have been and may\ncontinue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not\nbeen breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an\nincident, breach, or other disruption to, our or our vendors’ systems.\nAlso, applicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property, such as our trade\nsecrets and other proprietary data. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law effective in December\n2021 that would require us to provide customer data, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery\naddresses, to restaurant merchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a customer opts out.\nFurthermore, this could result in certain consumers receiving unsolicited outreach from merchants as a result of\nthis data sharing, which could lead to a negative consumer experience. We have filed a lawsuit challenging this\nlaw, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the pendency of the litigation. If our\nlawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect on our intellectual property or\nresult in harm to our reputation or brand. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived security or privacy\nbreaches or other incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as\na whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us. We also expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect\nand prevent privacy and security breaches and other incidents, and we may face increased costs and expend\nsubstantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived privacy or security breach or other incident.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any privacy or security breach or incident,\nregardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our\ninsurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities incurred relating to any privacy or security breach or\nincident, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that\nany insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims\nagainst us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe markets for local food delivery logistics and our other delivery logistics services are still in relatively\nearly stages of growth, and if these markets do not continue to grow, grow slower than we expect, or fail to grow\nas large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n24\nTable of Contents\nThe local food delivery logistics market has grown rapidly since we launched our local logistics platform in 2013,\nbut it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at\nall. In addition, the market for the other delivery logistics services we facilitate, such as grocery delivery\nservices, is also relatively nascent, and it is uncertain whether demand for grocery delivery services or other\ndelivery logistics services we may facilitate in the future will continue to grow and achieve wide market\nacceptance, if at all. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt\nlocal food delivery logistics and the other delivery logistics services we facilitate. If the public does not\nperceive these services as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding safety,\naffordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’\nplatforms or otherwise, or instead adopts alternative solutions that may arise, then the market for our platform\nmay not further develop, may develop slower than we expect, or may not achieve the growth potential we expect, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers or the\nactivities of Dashers while making deliveries to our consumers, have occurred, and in the future may occur, which\ncould adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities\ninclude food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, assault, battery,\ntheft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering\nDasher accounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such\nactivities may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business\ninterruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to\nbackground checks, fraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, attempted payments\nby consumers with insufficient funds, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers\nof Dasher accounts by bad actors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities\ninvolving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information, or\npayment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information,\nand mobile phone numbers. For example, bad actors have created Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal\nidentifying information to commit fraud on our platform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, this\nhas caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as Dashers. We have\nlaunched a series of initiatives and products changes to help prevent these practices.\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit\ncard data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we\nhave taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot\nguarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to\nadequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nactivities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivity by these parties from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through\nlitigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we have deactivated\nfrom our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform deliveries. At\nthe same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check, are too restrictive and\ninadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable\nto implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the\ngrowth and engagement of the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be\nadversely affected. In addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal,\nimproper, or otherwise inappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which\nenables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are\nretained directly by merchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in\nany of the other activities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on\n25\nTable of Contents\nour platform. Further, any negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our\nplatform or on our competitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of\nour industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which includes facilitating deliveries to consumers\nfrom non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less operationally\nefficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner merchants’\nsystems. For example, for orders with most partner merchants, Dashers have an expedited checkout process that does\nnot require a separate payment in store, but for orders with non-partner merchants, Dashers may have to place and\npay for the order separately in store. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each\norder, more time and manual processes needed to place each order, and a higher likelihood of errors. Further, we\nsometimes unintentionally incorrectly price non-partner goods on our platform as a result of inaccuracies that\noccur when capturing menu prices. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated\nwith facilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and\ncause damage to our reputation and brand. While our goal is to convert non-partner merchants into partner\nmerchants, our inability to do so at a sufficiently high rate, or at all, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, some non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed.\nWhile we honor these requests, removing non-partner merchants impacts our ability to provide a broad selection of\nmerchants. In addition, there is a risk that non-partner merchants bring legal claims against us relating to their\ninclusion on our platform. For example, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair\ncompetition, among other claims, and sought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. There is\nalso a risk that state or local law is enacted to prevent platforms like ours from including non-partners on the\nplatform. For example, the California Legislature passed legislation, California Assembly Bill 2149 (“AB 2149”),\nwhich was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and became effective on January 1, 2021. AB 2149 prohibits,\namong other things, food delivery logistics platforms from facilitating deliveries from restaurants in California\nwithout the restaurants’ prior consent. Similar prohibitions have also been enacted in jurisdictions where we\noperate including Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Arkansas, Virginia, Washington, DC, Nevada, Missouri, Oregon,\nRhode Island, New York, Colorado, and New Hampshire and are being contemplated in other jurisdictions. Beyond\nregulatory restrictions, we may also adopt internal policies that limit or prohibit the facilitation of deliveries\nfrom merchants without their prior consent. For example, in November 2020, we adopted internal policies pursuant to\nwhich we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our platform in the United States and\nsuch policies require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner restaurants on our platform in the United\nStates to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with DoorDash. In the future, based on a variety\nof factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may continue to revise and update our internal policies\nrelated to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we are required or we choose to remove non-\npartner merchants for any reason, this will adversely affect our ability to attract and retain consumers and could\ndirectly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsite and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail\nto expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance\nand improve our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely\naffected. If competitors introduce new offerings embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices emerge, our existing technology, services, website, and mobile applications may become obsolete. Our\nfuture success could depend on our ability to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and\npractices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to our platform and new services on our platform may involve significant technical risks and\nupfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively,\nor we may fail to\n26\nTable of Contents\nadapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features\nand services or if our recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in favor of those of\nour competitors.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may\nbe difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset\nthe additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,\nwe expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nnot only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of international\nusers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with\ndelivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market\nperception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability\nto scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local logistics platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our local logistics platform and\nwhile we continue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology,\nincluding enhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our\nrouting and batching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the\nresulting gains in efficiency to our platform that we expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the\ncost of our business and subject to a number of risks, including changes to our Dasher pay model. The cost\neffectiveness of our local logistics platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological\nimprovements do not reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and\ncredits. If we are unable to maintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our local logistics platform, including\nwith respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\n27\nTable of Contents\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending and Dasher behavior patterns that have an impact on our\ngrowth and expenses. We may experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the calendar year, although\nour rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to make, seasonal fluctuations\ndifficult to detect. For example, consumer activity can be impacted by colder or more inclement weather, which may\nincrease consumer demand, and warmer or sunny weather, which may decrease consumer demand. In addition, the number\nof available Dashers may decrease during periods of inclement weather, but consumer demand during these times may\nrequire us to have more Dashers available to fulfill orders. During these times, we typically rely on incentive pay\nto attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs. Further, severe\nweather in certain areas can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, and make it impossible for Dashers\nto make deliveries if roads are closed or difficult to drive on. In addition, we benefit from increased order\nvolume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we experience a decrease in order volume when school is\nnot in session and during summer breaks and other vacation periods, causing a similar decrease in Dasher pay.\nSeasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other\nseasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and\ncontribute to fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we\nmay not accurately forecast our results of operations. However, we base our spending and investment plans on\nforecasts and estimates, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than\nexpected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effects on consumer spending and merchant performance,\nmay adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the\nfactors having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment,\nconsumer debt, reductions in net worth, inflation, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy\nprices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of discretionary\nitems may decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes,\nwildfires, and threats to public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, small businesses that do not have\nsubstantial resources, like some of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor\neconomic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform cease operations, temporarily or\npermanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with\nsufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform. This risk is particularly\npronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in\nmarkets where we have fewer merchants. In addition, because spending for purchases from many of the merchants on\nour platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that any decline in consumer spending would\nhave a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses that sell products or services\nconsidered to be necessities. If spending at the merchants on our platform declines, consumers may be less likely\nto use our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages at merchants could negatively impact their ability to\nfulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplace and in our Drive business. Inflationary\npressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact consumer demand and drive lower order\nvolume on our Marketplace and in our Drive business.\n28\nTable of Contents\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new local markets in which we have limited or no prior\noperating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new local markets. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict consumer\npreferences and purchasing habits in these new local markets. In addition, each market has unique regulatory\ndynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the\npool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with insurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new\nDashers. In addition, each market is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our\nability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently attract and\nretain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key business\nmetrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in\nthe local markets where we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are\nunable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to\nadditional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\nWe have started expanding our presence internationally. For example, we launched our platform in Canada in 2015, in\nAustralia in 2019, in Japan and Germany in 2021, and we expect to expand our international operations. particularly\nthrough the proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\"). Operating outside of the United States may require\nsignificant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and\ncustoms, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations\nteams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a\nvariety of reasons, including:\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture\nacross all of our offices;\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to labor and employment, data\nprivacy, data protection, tax, and local regulatory restrictions;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility and\ngeopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with\nrespect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions.\n29\nTable of Contents\nIf we or our partners fail to develop and successfully commercialize autonomous or drone delivery technologies or\nfail to develop such technologies before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected,\nchange our cost structure materially, are inferior to those of our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than\nthose of our competitors or non-autonomous or non-drone delivery methods, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that autonomous and drone delivery technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact our\nindustry. We have invested and we expect to continue to invest in research and development related to autonomous\nand drone delivery technologies, either directly or in partnership with companies that develop such technologies.\nWhile we believe that autonomous and drone delivery could present substantial opportunities, the development of\nsuch technologies is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Failures of our or our partners’ autonomous or drone\ndelivery technologies could generate substantial liability, create negative publicity, or result in regulatory\nscrutiny, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, results of operations, and\nprospects. Even if our or our partners’ efforts to develop autonomous and drone delivery technologies are\nsuccessful, such efforts may not be cost-effective and there is no guarantee that such technologies can reduce our\ncurrent costs of facilitating on-demand delivery services. Further, several other companies, including Uber and\nAmazon, are also developing autonomous and drone delivery technologies, either themselves or through\ncollaborations, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the local logistics\nindustry. Certain competitors may commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies at scale before we or\nour partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone delivery to market before we do, or\ntheir technology is or is perceived to be superior to our or our partners’ technology, they may be able to leverage\nsuch technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. For example, if competitors develop autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies that successfully reduce the cost of facilitating delivery logistics services, these competitors could\noffer their services at lower prices as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a\nsignificant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, we expect that governments will develop regulations that are specifically designed to apply to autonomous\nand drone technologies. These regulations could include requirements that significantly delay or narrowly limit the\ncommercialization of autonomous and drone technologies, limit the amount of autonomous and drone delivery on our\nplatform, or impose significant liabilities on manufacturers or operators of these solutions or developers of these\ntechnologies. Moreover, these regulations may affect our or our partners’ ability to design and manufacture new\nautonomous or drone technologies. For example, commercial drone regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration limit the altitude, available airspace, and weight of a drone and also the certification of remote\npilots that can operate a drone for commercial purposes in the United States. If regulations of this nature\ncontinue to be implemented, we or our partners may not be able to commercialize autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or our partners are unable to comply with existing\nor new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous and drone solutions, we could become subject to substantial\nfines or penalties.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions,\nincluding acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments that\ncomplement our business. For example, in November 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wolt, a\nlocal commerce platform based in Finland, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022. We have previously\nacquired and continue to evaluate targets that operate in relatively nascent markets, and as a result, there is no\nassurance that such acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into our business or generate substantial\nrevenue.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and adversely affect our\nability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel of an acquired\ncompany;\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\n30\nTable of Contents\ndifficulties in retaining merchants, consumers, and delivery service providers, as applicable, of an acquired\ncompany;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition\nopportunities;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or\ntechnology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue\nrecognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired\ncompany or business;\nrisks that regulatory bodies do not approve our acquisitions or business combinations or delay such approvals;\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new services cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, in\nOctober 2021, we closed a $395 million investment in preferred shares of a private company based in Europe which\nprovides an instant grocery delivery service. Strategic investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control\nover business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or\ncompliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on\npartners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have\nbusiness interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or\nother actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who\ncontrol them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against\nus, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our\ninvestments may be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with\nforeign entities now or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign\ndirect investment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity was subject to\nregulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and\nthus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy. In addition, our investments are speculative in\nnature and may decline in value or be entirely lost.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments, or if we fail\nto successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our\nbusiness. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we\n31\nTable of Contents\nbelieve we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates and\nexisting employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this or other\nreasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of our\nemployees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our\nemployees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public\nmarkets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of\ncash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit,\ntrain, and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet. We\nmay operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal,\naccounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and\nplace significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with\n32\nTable of Contents\nthe SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms\nand that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to\nour principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over\nfinancial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement such\nprocesses and controls. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the\nyears ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. To address this material weakness, we hired\nadditional accounting, engineering, and business intelligence personnel and implemented process level and\nmanagement review controls to identify and address emerging risks. While we believe this material weakness has been\nremediated as of December 31, 2020, we cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material\nweaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial\nreporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any\ndifficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to\nfail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior\nperiods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting\nfirm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are\nrequired to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC commencing with this annual report on\nForm 10-K. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also\ncause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a\nnegative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet\nthese requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\nAdditionally, commencing with this annual report on Form 10-K, our independent registered public accounting firm is\nrequired to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the\nlevel at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to\nmaintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect\non our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\noverwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not\nreturn to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that\nwe do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our\ntechnology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n33\nTable of Contents\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue, and\naccess or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in\nexposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We\nmay need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around\nerrors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any\nsuch errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting and/or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will\nresult in dilution to our stockholders. We also permit certain RSU holders to elect to cover the RSU tax\nwithholding liabilities by providing to us a cash payment amount.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs, we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued\nwith respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash (which may include cash generated from the\nproceeds of the IPO) to satisfy such tax obligations, (ii) have the holders of such RSUs use a broker or brokers to\nsell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement date, with the proceeds of such sales to\nbe delivered to us for remittance to the relevant taxing authorities, in order to satisfy such tax withholding and\nremittance obligations, or (iii) allow certain holders of such RSUs to pay us an amount in cash, via a broker,\nsufficient to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding obligations. The tax withholding due in connection with such\nRSU vesting and settlement will be based on the then-current value of the underlying shares of our Class A common\nstock, and we would expect to withhold and remit the tax withholding liabilities at the applicable statutory rates\non behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash. If we withhold shares of our Class A common\nstock that would otherwise be issued with respect to the vesting and/or settlement of RSUs and pay the relevant tax\nauthorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations, this may result in significant cash expenditures by us. We\nhave implemented “sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, pursuant to which shares with a market\nvalue equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and\nsettlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the\ntaxing authorities. Such sales or any cash amount that the holder provides to us to cover the applicable RSU tax\nwithholding obligations, in either case, will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the\ntax withholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number\nof shares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts and key business and non-\nGAAP metrics such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, with internal systems and tools\nthat are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics\npublished by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our\ninternal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may\nchange over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly\ndisclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or\ncontain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are\nbased on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there\nare inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy\nof our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there\nare consumers who have multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement\nmeasures to detect and prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the\nnumber of consumers on our platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with\nrespect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could\naffect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if\ninvestors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with\nrespect to these figures, we expect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.\nIn addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations\nof the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\nother things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public\ncompany, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract\nmanagement, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a\nresult of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition\nwill become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our\nmanagement team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous\nscrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant\nattention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our\nbusiness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n35\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification\nof Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an\nindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and\nregulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to changes and\ndivergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. We\nmaintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors. However, Dashers may be reclassified\nas employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on service provider classification and\ntheir potential impact on the local logistics industry. A reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service\nproviders as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations,\nincluding as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to failure to, withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service providers as\nemployees would require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability\nto add and retain Dashers to our platform and grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in\nDynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for\nexample, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. This action is seeking both\nrestitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as\nindependent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also sought a preliminary injunction that would have\nbarred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as independent contractors during the pendency of this\ncase. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn in December 2020. We believe we have meritorious\ndefenses, despite the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In\naddition, in 2017, we settled one classification matter in California on a class basis including claims raised\nunder PAGA and in 2022 we settled a similar classification matter covering Massachusetts and California Dashers\nincluding claims raised under PAGA.\nSome jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to determine\nworker classification. Further, the California Legislature passed AB 5 and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin\nNewsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding\ncontractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other\ncompanies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and\npreserve flexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court in California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The\nCalifornia Attorney General and other groups and individuals have filed notices of appeal to the California Court\nof Appeal. As a result, to the extent\n36\nTable of Contents\nProposition 22 remains in effect pending further court proceedings, as such, certain provisions regarding\ncompensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California and our costs\nrelated to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we do in certain\ncircumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time. Depending on\nwhether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs could also lead to a lower\nNet Revenue Margin, which we previously referred to in past SEC filings as Take Rate, defined as revenue expressed\nas a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now applicable to us\ninclude, but are not limited to, (i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other amounts) to\nDashers no less than a net earnings floor equal to (A) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged time and (B)\nfor Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for inflation after 2021)\nand (ii) for Dashers averaging at least fifteen (15) hours per week of engaged time during a calendar quarter who\nsubscribe to a qualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of varying dollar amounts\ndepending on a Dasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 is likely to have an adverse impact on our\nresults of operations. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation\nthat would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in\nongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work\nthat Dashers perform. To the extent other states adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related to\nDashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we\ncharge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our results of\noperations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could\nstill be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior\nCourt challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County Superior Court’s\norder noted above (which is being appealed), and similar challenges may also be filed. Furthermore, if Dashers are\ndetermined to be employees in other states or under federal law, this could result in even higher increases to our\ncosts related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and commissions even more and may result in\nfurther lower order volumes. To the extent Dashers are determined to be employees under other state or federal law,\nwe would be required to significantly alter our existing business model and operations, which would have an adverse\nimpact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses\nfor legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our\nbusiness generally, and with the food delivery services we facilitate in particular, including potential claims\nrelated to food offerings, delivery, and quality.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal,\nregulatory, and other administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage,\nworker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer\ncomplaints, intellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to consumers and Dashers, compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits,\ngovernment investigations, and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by Dashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we\nsometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the\nuncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we\nface increasing public scrutiny. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic\nbeverages or alcohol consumption. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of,\nany consumers, Dashers, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to potential legal\nclaims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could do so in the\nfuture as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that\ngenerate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our business. The\npotential for acts of terrorism on the United States or international food supply also exists and, if such an event\noccurs, it could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through our platform\ncould be subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to\n37\nTable of Contents\nensure compliance with a food recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering,\nor inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants\nthat are not on our platform, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry,\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax,\nservice fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including the background\ncheck process, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email, text, or telephone. In\naddition, we also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers relating\nto, among other things, our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales\ntax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the local food delivery logistics services we facilitate,\ndiscrepancies between the menus on our website and consumer mobile application and the menus at the restaurant from\nwhich the food is delivered, including discrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and taxes on such\nitems, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or telephone.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our\nwebsite and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and\nnegligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security\nincident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our\nnotification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or\nregulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious\nor not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible\nthat a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and\npenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These\nproceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or\nother orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual\nand other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial\npartners and current and former directors and officers.\nIn addition, we include arbitration and class action waiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation\nprocess for all parties involved, as they can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in\nstate or federal court. However, arbitration can be costly and burdensome, and the use of arbitration and class\naction waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been\nthe subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we may\nlimit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory\nproceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit\ncertain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal law, there is a risk that some or\nall of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised\nto exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in\npart, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental\n38\nTable of Contents\nstatutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the Internet\nand e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax obligations, and as\na result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the ultimate tax\ndetermination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our business or to\nlocal logistics businesses generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions\nabout tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the\nUnited States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as Canada and Australia, and we may face various\nindirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit\nindirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation,\nreporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently\ndo so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful\nassertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not\ncurrently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result\nin substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the\nappropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally,\nif merchants try to pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline.\nAlthough we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if\nthese liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition would be harmed.\nUnder state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain\nstates. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and could be applicable to the cost of\ngoods or fees charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use,\nor other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past\nsales and additional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our\nplatform. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing\nauthorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\ncollect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related\nlegislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have enacted\nlaws that would require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting\nor collection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. This new\nlegislation could require us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated\nwith tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less\nattractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee taxpayer\ninformation and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a failure to\ncomply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a percentage of\nthe amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to the large number\nof Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these reporting\nobligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy such\nfailures in a timely manner.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\ncertain non-deductible expenses, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate\nwould reduce profitability or increase losses.\n39\nTable of Contents\nAs we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States or foreign\ntaxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nFurther, income earned by us and our subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction, such as\nthe jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of us or the applicable subsidiary as well as the jurisdiction\nfrom which such income is derived. This may result in double taxation if relief is not available under applicable\ndomestic or non-U.S. law or an applicable tax treaty. Any double taxation may impact the financial results of our\noperations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and\nforeign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no\nassurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to employment taxes\nand sales taxes are described in more detail under “ — If Dashers in the United States are reclassified as\nemployees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected .” and “ — Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or\nremitted, or in the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or\nwithholding taxes, and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations,\nor inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ”\nIn addition, regulatory or legislative developments may also arise from the proposed U.S. tax reform under the\nBiden Administration, which has proposed a new corporate alternative minimum tax and increased taxation of\ninternational business operations. There is uncertainty regarding what changes, if any, will be enacted and the\neffect on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had accumulated $4,125 million and $3,265 million of federal and state net operating\nloss carryforwards, (\"NOLs\"), respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to\nexpire in 2036 for federal and 2024 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income\nin time to use NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue\nCode of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability\nto use its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income\nmay be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5\npercent stockholders” that exceeds fifty (50) percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may\napply under state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D credit carryforwards,\nto reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership\nchanges and ownership changes that may occur in the future. Prior to the utilization of NOLs in the future, we will\ndetermine whether there are any limitations under Section 382 of the Code.\nThere is also a risk that due to changes in applicable law or regulatory changes (such as suspensions on the use of\nNOLs and other tax attributes by certain jurisdictions, including in order to raise additional revenue to help\ncounter the fiscal impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly with retroactive effect) or other unforeseen\nreasons, our existing NOLs and other tax attributes could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and\nother tax attributes.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims.\nThe local delivery logistics industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, insurance, and pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and standards\ngoverning issues such as worker classification or our relationship with Dashers on our platform more generally (for\nexample, those concerning Dasher pay, insurance requirements, and other aspects of our relationship with Dashers),\nlabor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products,\nonline credit card payments, gratuities, pricing and commissions, text messaging, membership services, intellectual\nproperty, data retention, privacy, data security, consumer protection, background checks, website and mobile\napplication accessibility, and tax are\n40\nTable of Contents\noften complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of\nspecificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain\nand may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations between state and federal law, between\nindividual states, and even at the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may\nchange or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by\nregulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have been\nproactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available\nbroadly in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including Canada and Australia.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their\nusers and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion\nof privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on\nthe nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,\nregulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative\nand regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business. It is also\nlikely that as our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, as with\nour November 2021 launch in Germany, we would become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.\nIt is difficult to predict how existing laws would be applied to our business and the new laws to which it may\nbecome subject.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,\ntechnology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and\nadministrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they\nmay view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to\nour business, including by changing employment-related laws or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses\nlike ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in connection with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, over fifty (50) jurisdictions across the United States, including many jurisdictions in\nCalifornia, have implemented temporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, some\njurisdictions have enacted permanent price controls, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York,\nPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania, and Minneapolis, Minnesota (although the latter two jurisdictions’ price restrictions\ndo not apply when certain conditions are met). We filed litigation challenging the San Francisco and New York price\ncontrols as unconstitutional and in excess of each respective jurisdiction’s police power. There are legislative\nproposals in additional jurisdictions to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we\nexpect other such proposals to be made in the future. These price controls have had in the past, and are likely to\nhave in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These price controls have also caused, and may\nin the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers, though we are aware of multiple jurisdictions\nwhich have adopted explicit limits or prohibitions against doing so in connection with price controls, which could\nfurther increase our costs. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or\ncollect such increased consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as\nconfusing and/or misleading to consumers. Although temporary price controls in some jurisdictions in which we\noperate have expired, with the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect existing price controls to\npersist in the near term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If\nany of these events occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory\nscrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which\ncreates additional challenges to managing our business.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses that perceive our\nbusiness model negatively to raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their\ntrade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant resources to shape the\nlegal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to\nchange such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the\nability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply with these laws or\nregulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that\nwe may not be able to anticipate at this time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement\nnew measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to\ndiscontinue certain services or platform features, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings,\nfines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement\nactions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative\nproposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred\nto prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws\nand regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other\nanticorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad. These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government\nofficials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person, or gain any\nimproper advantage. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and\ncompliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address\ncompliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of\nour policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, and our exposure for violating\nthese laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign\njurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money\nlaundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of\nsignificant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment\nfrom U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or\noverall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws\nspecifically governing the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and\nfuture laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce,\nor other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business\npractices, or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue\nto evolve, may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content,\ncopyrights, distribution, social media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts\nand other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and\nquality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and\nother taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to\nexpand internationally, it is possible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our\nmobile applications or website or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and website. Any\nfailure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our\nreputation and brand, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the users on our platform, as well as\nother personal data relating to individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and\ninternational laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and\nprotection of certain types of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal\nInformation Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and\nMarketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, Australia’s Privacy Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (the “GDPR”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the “TCPA”). Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”). These laws, rules, and regulations evolve\nfrequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, and\nchanges in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires disclosures\nto California consumers, imposes obligations on businesses that process California consumers' personal information,\nand\n42\nTable of Contents\naffords such consumers new rights, including the ability to opt out of certain sales of personal information. The\nCCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation as well as a private right of action for certain data\nbreaches that result in the loss of personal information, which could increase the likelihood of, and risks\nassociated with, data breach litigation.\nThe CCPA continues to evolve and could require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and expose\nus to further regulatory or operational burdens. Also, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) was approved\nby California voters and significantly modifies the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty and likely requiring us\nto incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA has created obligations relating to\npersonal information as of January 1, 2022, Other states have also enacted or proposed similar privacy laws. For\nexample in March 2021, Virginia enacted a Consumer Data Protection Act that will go into effect January 1, 2023,\nand Colorado enacted a Colorado Privacy Act that will go into effect July 1, 2023. Both of these laws differ from\nthe CPRA, Similar laws are being considered by other state legislatures. This legislation and other proposed laws\nmay add additional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional\ninvestment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of data and could result in\nincreased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies. In addition, all 50 states have laws\nincluding obligations to provide notification of security breaches involving personal data to affected individuals,\nstate officers and others.\nMoreover, we will become subject to additional countries’ privacy laws as we expand our international operations.\nFor example, with our November 2021 launch in Germany, we became subject to the GDPR, which imposes strict\nrequirements relating to the processing of personal data. European Union (\"EU\") member states have enacted\nlegislation that adds to or interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential\nliability for failing to meet such obligations. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal\ndata subject to the GDPR to the United States as well as other countries that have not been found to provide\nadequate protection to such personal data. The GDPR also afford greater control for data subjects (for example, the\n“right to be forgotten”), increased data portability for data subjects, and data breach notification requirements.\nNoncompliance is subject to significant penalties, which can include fines of up to the greater of €20 million or\n4% of total worldwide revenue and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Such penalties are in\naddition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects.\nIn addition to laws and regulations, we are subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data\nSecurity Standard, which requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder\ninformation. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or\nconsequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, information security or consumer protection or any loss, unavailability or inadvertent or unauthorized\nuse, modification, disclosure, or other processing of data that we store or handle as part of operating our\nbusiness.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data\nprotection, and information security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or\ncontractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA, CPRA and GDPR imposing new and\nrelatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of\nthese and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary\nchanges to our policies and practices and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.\nAdditionally, our success depends, in part, on our ability to access, collect and use data about and relating to\nDashers, merchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as “cookies,” is\nfurther restricted, regulated or blocked, the amount or accuracy of Internet user information we collect would\ndecrease, which could harm our business and results of operations. Federal, state, and foreign governmental\nauthorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the practice of online tracking for\nbehavioral advertising and other purposes. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted, have considered, or are\nconsidering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals\nto engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a\ncompany can employ electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. For example, the European\nCommission has proposed a draft regulation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (the\n“ePrivacy Regulation”), which would replace the current ePrivacy Directive. If adopted, the earliest date for entry\ninto force is in 2023, with broad potential impacts on the use of Internet-based services and tracking\ntechnologies, such as cookies. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of the ePrivacy\nRegulation and national implementation laws once they are enacted . In addition to the EU, other regulators are\nincreasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem. For\nexample, the CCPA grants California consumers the right to opt-out of a company’s sharing of personal information\nfor advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration. Moreover, some providers of\nconsumer devices and web browsers have implemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block tracking\ntechnologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted,\nsignificantly reduce the\n43\nTable of Contents\neffectiveness of such practices and technologies. For example, Apple introduced an iOS update in April 2021 that\nallowed users to more easily opt-out of tracking activity across devices, which has impacted and may continue to\nimpact business. As a result, we may have to develop alternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior,\ncustomize their online experience or efficiently market to them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or platform\ncould be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or\nobligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors or merchants on our platform, to comply with applicable\nlaws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, or any\ncompromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal data or other data\nrelating to Dashers, consumers, or other individuals, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure\nor compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing Dashers and consumers from\nusing our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims\nand litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our\nreputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities\nor claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of\nautomated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil\nclaims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text\nmessages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we\nbecome liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") are subject to interpretation by\nthe FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A\nchange in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations\nand could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in May\n2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers\n(Topic 606)” (“ASC 606”), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC 842”), which increases lease transparency and\ncomparability among organizations. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles\nor our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance\ncoverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their\nobligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including auto liability,\nemployment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches,\ncrime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business\nliabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving\nservices, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough\ninsurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services,\nand we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain.\nAdditionally, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related\nclaims that we make. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of\ninsurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of\nthese merchant agreements.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured\nretentions, or\n44\nTable of Contents\notherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many\nbusinesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or we may\ndecide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim, premiums, or\nthe number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience a\nclaim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we\nexperience a claim for which coverage is not provided or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-\ninsured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third party and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers. Under our commercial\nagreement with Stripe, Stripe may terminate the relationship with advanced notice. If Stripe terminates its\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be\nrequired to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such payment\nprocessor in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and services provided by Stripe may not meet our\nexpectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these\nrisks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions or make timely\npayments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of time, make our\nplatform less convenient and attractive to users, and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nNearly all payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment services,\nwhich subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws\nand regulations relating to the payments we accept from our consumers, including with respect to money laundering,\nmoney transfers, privacy, and information security. If we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable\nregulations, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or\ncriminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other\npayment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely\non data provided by Stripe for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in\nsuch data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nFurther, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable law, we could become subject to\ncertain laws, rules, and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and\nnumerous state and local agencies that may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may\nhave a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we\ncould be subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial\nservices, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations governing our business that we are\nsubject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we\nare not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more\njurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply\nwith applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or\ncompliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating\nrules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain\nservices to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or\nregulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment\nprocessor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these\nrules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations on a single datacenter provided by Amazon Web Services\n(“AWS”), a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the\nfacilities of AWS that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters,\ncybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s\ncontinuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the\nfuture we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to\na variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and\ncapacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the\nrequirements of users on our platform. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to\nour success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform. It may become\nincreasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand\nand the usage of our platform increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our\nreputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform. Any of the above circumstances or events\nmay harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short-\nterm loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the\nagreement for convenience by providing us at least thirty (30) days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the\nagreement for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a\n30-day cure period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice. Even\nthough our platform is entirely in the cloud, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud\ninfrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated\nor we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime for a\nshort period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers.\nHowever, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers\nwould cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations over the longer term.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal\nand/or driving records of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those that are\nnot qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be\nadversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the\nrequirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to\nfind an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable\ntimeframe. In certain jurisdictions, including the United States, we rely on a single third-party background check\nprovider for these jurisdictions. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms\nacceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less\nattractive to potential Dashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further,\nif the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise\nmeet our expectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we\nmay be unable to adequately protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified\nDashers may be inadvertently excluded from our platform. For example, we had a Dasher who had a criminal conviction\nthat should have excluded him from using our platform who was nonetheless cleared by one of our background check\nproviders, and as a result, we allowed him to make deliveries on our platform and he was subsequently alleged to\ncause personal injury to a merchant on our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation\nand brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In\naddition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we\nmay not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our\nplatform. In addition, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet\nthe requirements under applicable laws and regulations, we could face legal liability or negative publicity.\n46\nTable of Contents\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced non-material issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related\nto notice requirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be\nlimited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail\nto conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of\neligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By\nchoosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the\ndistribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the\nmapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all\nmapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping\nfunctions may not be reliable. From time to time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of\nour third-party software providers. If, in connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its\nrelationship with us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our\nplatform could be disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software\nthat we and Dashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software\non terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such\nsoftware, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or\ninferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not\ncontrol.\nWe have integrations with Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio, Wavefront, Snowflake, Olo, third-party offerings such as\nGoogle Maps and AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party applications, products, and services are\nconstantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with\nthird-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our\nplatform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or\nexert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nAs our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we face to increase. Should any of our\ncompetitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that\ndegrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our platform, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n47\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such\napplication marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that reduce\nthe effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial\nresults, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. Any\nchanges in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our applications or give\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ applications could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile\ndevices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our\napplications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our\napplications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify\ntheir search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such\nmobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our applications, our\nuser growth could slow. Our applications have experienced fluctuations in the past, and we anticipate similar\nfluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will\ncontinue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our applications. Additionally, in order to\ndeliver high-quality applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range\nof mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining\nrelationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’ experience. If merchants, consumers,\nor Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile\ndevices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our user growth\nand user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers and Dashers. For example, Apple has imposed new requirements\nfor consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and has implemented a new application tracking transparency\nframework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. These changes have, and we expect that these\nchanges will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions because they will\nlimit our visibility into the performance of specific advertising channels. If we are unable to mitigate the\neffects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates from\nexisting consumers on our platform, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new consumer growth could decline and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected if we fail to appear prominently in\nsearch results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search\nengines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is\ndue in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search\nengine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may\nnot be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Our website has experienced\nfluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any\nreduction in the number of consumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n48\nTable of Contents\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information from third-\nparty sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources\nor the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and\ninformation may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including general expectations\nconcerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size,\nare based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of\nassumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or\nthe methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or\nmethodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, our reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate. Also, applicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property, such as our\ntrade secrets and other proprietary information. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law which went\ninto effect in December 2021 that would require us to provide customer data, such as names, phone numbers, emails\nand delivery addresses, to restaurants merchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a customer\nopts out. We have filed a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against\nus during the pendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an\nadverse effect on our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions. Competitors have and may continue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our\nability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade\nname or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not\ntimely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property.\nOur efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of\n49\nTable of Contents\nthese claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our\nfavor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Further, an adverse\noutcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we\nare found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease making, licensing, or using\nproducts that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend additional development\nresources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order\nto obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable\non terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license intellectual property which would\nrequire us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are\nresolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to resolve them\ncould adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com.\nIf we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable\nregistration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could\ncause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in\nquestion. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of\nreasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using\ndomain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that\ninfringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nProtecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses,\nbe required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software\nlicense. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and\nultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the release of the\naffected portions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial\ntime, and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our\nsoftware until we can adequately address the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that\nincorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to\nfully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or\nother liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on\nterms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our\nplatform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source\ncode form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\n50\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire\ncomplementary businesses and technologies. We believe our working capital will be sufficient to meet our\nanticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve (12) months and beyond. From time to time, we may\nseek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our\nongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or\nconvertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we\nissue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We\nevaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other\nthings, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance and the condition of the capital\nmarkets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us,\nif at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require\nit, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired,\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility includes a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to\nrefinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing,\nit may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2021,\nthere were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility.\n51\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Ownership of DoorDash Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has twenty (20) votes per share, and our\nClass C common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. The Co-Founders together hold all\nof the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2021, Tony Xu, our co-founder,\nChief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer\nEngineering, and a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a\nmember of our board of directors collectively held 66% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in\naggregate, which voting power may increase over time as the Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity\nawards (including those equity awards granted to the Co-Founders prior to the IPO and subject to equity exchange\nright agreements whereby each of the Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any\nshares of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or\nthe vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of\nClass B common stock). If all such equity awards held by the Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had\nbeen exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31, 2021, the Co-Founders\nwould collectively hold 76% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. The Co-Founders have also entered\ninto the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and\nvote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and\npermitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will\nbe able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including\nthe election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,\nand the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major\ncorporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you\ndisagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,\npreventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to\nreceive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market\nprice of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause\nconflicts of interest between the Co-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in Mr. Xu undertaking,\nor causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or the Co-Founders but would not be\ndesirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among the Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one (1) share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed\nby our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the first\ndate on which the number of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible\ninstruments, held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B\ncommon stock held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of the IPO, which\nwe sometimes refer to herein as the “35% Ownership Threshold”; (ii) twelve (12) months after the death or permanent\nand total disability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted\nas directed by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors(or if there is no such person,\nthen our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one\n(61) days and no more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no\nless than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer\nproviding services to us as an officer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board\nof directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr.\nXu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We\nrefer to the date on which such final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the\nterms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation occurs as the “Final Conversion Date”.\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually\n52\nTable of Contents\nresult in the Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower. Once the Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power, Mr. Xu would no longer\nhave the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted for\na vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock have no voting rights (except as required by\nlaw), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution, which would prolong the voting\ncontrol of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to Mr. Xu would also delay the\nfinal conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class C common stock issued to\nMr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met. As a result, the\nissuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our voting power and\nhis ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our\nstockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to the Co-Founders and, in that event,\nthey would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their holdings without\ndiminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will not be subject to\napproval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\").\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail\nourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, the Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2021, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of\nthe voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a\n“controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange\nregarding corporate governance, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\nthe requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance\nevaluation of the committee; and\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,\nand the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal\nadvisors, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled\ncompany” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these\nexemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the\nNew York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the\nprotections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it\nwill no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices\ninclude the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P\nComposite 1500. Also in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment\nof no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices\nand in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in\nits indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under\nsuch announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain\nindices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds,\n53\nTable of Contents\nand other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock.\nThese policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of\npublicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as\ncompared to similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive\nstrategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude\ninvestment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a\nresult, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors, such as\nour announcement of the pending acquisition of Wolt;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we previously filed a registration statement to register\nshares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction\nof applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of\noutstanding RSU awards will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “ Voting Threshold\nDate ”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended\nor approved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain\n55\nTable of Contents\ncircumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class\nA common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common\nstock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action under the Securities Act. Nothing in our amended and restated bylaws precludes\nstockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state or federal court, subject\nto applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Acquisition of Wolt\nThe proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\") will not be completed unless the conditions are satisfied or\nwaived. If the Transaction is not completed, our and Wolt’s future business and financial results could be\nnegatively affected.\n56\nTable of Contents\nOn November 9, 2021, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Wolt. Our and Wolt’s obligations to\nconsummate the Transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. These conditions\ninclude, among other customary conditions, receipt of certain specified regulatory approvals, the absence of\ncertain laws or orders prohibiting or making illegal the Transaction, effectiveness of the registration statement\non Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844) registering the shares of our Class A common stock issuable to the Wolt\nshareholders and holders of outstanding and unexercised vested options to purchase shares of Wolt class A common\nstock (\"Wolt Vested Optionholders\", jointly referred to as \"Seller\") as consideration in the Transaction, approval\nof a prospectus under Finnish law by the Finnish authorities, if required pursuant to applicable laws, execution of\nan escrow agreement by the parties and an escrow agent related to the escrow of certain shares to secure the\nSellers’ indemnification obligations, no event occurring that had or would reasonably be expected to result in a\nDoorDash Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the DoorDash Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844)) or a Wolt Material\nAdverse Effect (as defined in the DoorDash Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844)), compliance by the parties with their\ncovenants in the Share Purchase Agreement, dated November 9, 2021 (the \"Share Purchase Agreement\") in all material\nrespects, the accuracy of representations and warranties made by us or Wolt, and certain conditions related to key\nemployees and the lockup agreements entered into by certain Wolt stockholders (the “Lockup Agreements\").\nIn addition, if the Transaction is not completed by the termination date specified in the Share Purchase Agreement,\nor certain other events have occurred that prevent the closing conditions from being satisfied, either we or Wolt\nmay choose to terminate the Share Purchase Agreement. We or Wolt may also elect to terminate the Share Purchase\nAgreement in certain other circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Share Purchase\nAgreement at any time prior to the closing of the Transaction. There is no assurance that the Transaction will be\nconsummated.\nIf the Transaction is delayed, terminated or otherwise not completed, DoorDash and Wolt would not realize any of\nthe expected benefits of the Transaction and may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our or\nWolt’s business, results of operations and stock price, including, among others:\nunder certain circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee of €210 million;\nDoorDash and Wolt will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to the Transaction, including, as\napplicable, professional fees and expenses, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and notices, and other\ntransaction-related costs, fees and expenses. These costs are payable by DoorDash and Wolt whether or not the\nTransaction is complete. If the Transaction is not completed, DoorDash and Wolt will have incurred substantial\nexpenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received by DoorDash or Wolt;\nmatters related to the Transaction (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and\nresources by our and Wolt’s management teams and numerous others throughout our and Wolt’s organizations, which\ncould otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities;\nwe may acquire a majority but less than all of the outstanding shares in the Transaction, which may result in\nobligations to the minority shareholders of Wolt or additional expenses and obligations in connection with, and\nfollowing, the Transaction;\nDoorDash and Wolt may be subject to legal proceedings related to the Transaction or the failure to complete the\nTransaction, which could be time consuming and expensive, could divert DoorDash's and Wolt’s managements’ attention\naway from their regular business and, if any lawsuit is adversely resolved against DoorDash or Wolt, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their financial condition;\na delay in completing the Transaction, or failure to complete the Transaction, negative perceptions about the\nTransaction, or other factors beyond DoorDash’s and Wolt’s control, may result in negative publicity and a negative\nperception of DoorDash and/or Wolt in the investment community, and could negatively impact on our stock price; and\nany disruptions to our or Wolt’s businesses resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Transaction,\nincluding any adverse changes in DoorDash’s or Wolt’s relationships with their respective customers, suppliers,\npartners or employees, may continue to intensify in the event the Transaction is not consummated.\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt may subject us to certain liabilities associated with Wolt or\nliabilities that may arise in connection with the completion of the transaction.\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt with us may pose special risks, including write-offs or restructuring\ncharges, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that the integration will be\naccomplished effectively or in a timely manner. In addition, the Transaction and the integration of Wolt will\nsubject us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the completion of the Transaction,\nsome of which may be unknown.\n57\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we and our advisers have conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt and we have certain rights of\nindemnification, including the escrow of shares to secure the Sellers’ obligations, there can be no guarantee that\nwe are aware of all liabilities of Wolt or that the amounts in escrow will be sufficient. Further, the escrow\nconsists of shares and therefore, even if we are able to recover from the escrow, we will need to use our cash and\nresources to pay for the liabilities and damages. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties\nrelated to the transaction not currently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur,\ncould negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our profitability.\nFurther, Wolt’s business is different in certain ways from ours, and our results of operations may as a result be\naffected by factors that differ from those currently affecting our results of operations.\nOur and Wolt’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the\nTransaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and Wolt’s results of operations, cash flows and financial\nposition.\nParties with which we and Wolt do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Transaction, including\nwith respect to current or future business relationships with us, Wolt or the combined company following the\ncompletion of the transaction. Our and Wolt’s relationships may be subject to disruption as merchants, Dashers and\ncouriers, and other persons with whom we and/or Wolt have a business relationship may have concerns about a larger,\nmore international organization, or otherwise, and may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to\nseek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Wolt, as applicable, or consider entering\ninto business relationships with parties other than us or Wolt. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on\nthe results of operations, cash flows and financial position of us, Wolt or the combined company following the\ncompletion of the transaction, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the expected benefits of the\ntransaction. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of\nor failure to complete the transaction.\nUncertainties associated with the Transaction may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, and\nDoorDash and the combined company may have difficulty attracting and motivating management personnel and other key\nemployees, which could adversely affect the future businesses and operations of DoorDash and the combined company.\nDoorDash and Wolt are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective management personnel\nand other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company’s success after the completion of the\nTransaction will depend in part upon the ability of DoorDash and Wolt to attract, motivate and retain key\nmanagement personnel and other key employees. Prior to completion of the Transaction, current and prospective\nemployees of DoorDash and Wolt may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following\nthe completion of the Transaction, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of DoorDash and Wolt to\nattract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. In addition, no assurance can be given\nthat DoorDash will be able to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees of DoorDash\nand Wolt to the same extent that DoorDash and Wolt have previously been able to attract or retain their own\nemployees. If key employees terminate their employment, DoorDash’s business activities may be adversely affected\nand management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating DoorDash and Wolt to hiring suitable\nreplacements, all of which may cause DoorDash’s business to suffer.\nWolt is subject to numerous legal and regulatory regimes and the combined business could be harmed by changes to,\nor the interpretation or the application of, the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which it\noperates.\nWolt is also subject to a number of legal and compliance risks, and these risks may adversely affect the combined\ncompany after completion of the Transaction. Wolt operates in twenty-three (23) countries in Europe and Asia,\nincluding, among others, Japan, Finland, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and Israel. The international scope of Wolt’s\nbusiness requires us to comply with a wide range of EU-level, national and local laws and regulations, which may in\ncertain cases diverge from or even conflict with each other.\nWolt’s business principally consists of providing an online delivery logistics platform and enabling people to get\nthe same Wolt delivery experience from virtually any type of merchant (which in the case of Wolt includes, among\nothers, restaurants, grocery stores, retail shops or boutiques), including operating its own Wolt Market grocery\nstores. With the geographic expansion of DoorDash’s business and that of its subsidiaries, including also Wolt\nafter the consummation of the Transaction, into new markets, DoorDash will become subject to additional and\nchanging legal, regulatory, tax, licensing, and compliance requirements and industry standards with respect to\ndelivery logistics providers.\n58\nTable of Contents\nIn countries where DoorDash and Wolt operate, legislators and regulatory authorities may introduce new\ninterpretations of existing laws and regulations or introduce new legislation or regulations concerning the\nbusiness of DoorDash and/or Wolt, e.g., the independent contractor model for couriers. Changes in government\nregulation of or successful challenges to the independent contractor model used by Wolt in certain markets may\nrequire Wolt to change its existing business models and operations.”). Any additional regulatory scrutiny or\nchanges in legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs and make it uneconomical for the combined\ncompany to continue to operate in all of the current markets or to expand in accordance with our strategy,\nparticularly if regulations or their interpretations vary greatly or conflict between different operating\ncountries. This may negatively impact Wolt’s or our revenue and profitability by preventing our or Wolt’s business\nfrom reaching sufficient scale in particular markets or having to change its business model or incur additional\ncosts, which would adversely impact the combined company after the completion of the transaction. Our inability, or\nperceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead to regulatory scrutiny,\nwhich could result in administrative or enforcement action, such as fines, penalties, and/or enforceable\nundertakings and adversely affect the combined company after the completion of the transaction.\nThe Transaction and the expansion of the combined company may lead to an increase in competitive pressure from both\nexisting competitors and new entrants in the already highly competitive food delivery logistics industry.\nAs a result of the Transaction, DoorDash, through the operations of Wolt, will operate in a greater geographical\narea than it does currently. A number of competitors both in Europe and Asia offer food delivery logistics services\nsimilar to those offered by DoorDash and Wolt. Existing competitors and new entrants in this space in Europe and\nAsia may engage in aggressive consumer acquisition campaigns, develop superior offerings or consolidate with other\nentities and achieve benefits of scale. Such competitive pressures in an already highly competitive market may\nmaterially erode Wolt’s existing market share and negatively impact Wolt’s revenue, and may hinder Wolt’s expansion\ninto new markets, which could adversely impact the combined company after the completion of the transaction.\nFollowing the completion of the Transaction, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will\nbe increased.\nWe are currently subject to some foreign currency exchange risk because we conduct business operations in several\nforeign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which conduct business in their respective local\ncurrencies. Wolt conducts a significant portion of its operations outside of the United States through its\nsubsidiaries or affiliates, which also operate in their respective local currencies, the most significant of which\nare currently the Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Israeli Shekel. Therefore, following the completion of the\nTransaction, our international operations will account for a more significant portion of our overall operations\nthan they do presently and our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase. Because\nour financial statements will continue to be presented in U.S. dollars subsequent to the completion of the\ntransaction, the local currencies will be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for\ninclusion in our consolidated financial statements, thereby increasing the foreign exchange translation risk.\nWe may be targeted by securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and\nmay delay or prevent the Transaction from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have\nentered into share purchase agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can\nresult in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary\ndamages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff\nis successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Transaction, then that injunction may delay\nor prevent the Transaction from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe, which may\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. Currently, neither we nor Wolt is\naware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the\nTransaction.\nThe Transaction may be completed even though a material adverse effect may result from the announcement of the\nTransaction, industry-wide changes or other causes.\nIn general, either party can refuse to complete the Transaction if there is a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect or a\nWolt Material Adverse Effect (each as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement) affecting the other party prior to\nthe closing. However, some types of changes that would result in a material adverse effect of either party are\nexcluded from the definitions of a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect or a Wolt Material Adverse Effect, and do not\npermit either party to\n59\nTable of Contents\nrefuse to complete the Transaction. If such adverse changes occur but we and Wolt still complete the Transaction,\nthe market price of our Class A common stock may suffer.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction, if, among other things, we\nare unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost\nsavings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the Transaction are not realized, or if the transaction\ncosts related to the Transaction are greater than expected. The market price may also decline if we do not achieve\nthe perceived benefits of the Transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by investors or financial or\nindustry analysts or if the effect of the Transaction on our financial position, results of operations or cash\nflows is not consistent with the expectations of investors or financial or industry analysts. The issuance of\nshares of our Class A common stock in the Transaction could on its own have the effect of depressing the market\nprice for our Class A common stock. In addition, many Wolt shareholders and Wolt Vested Optionholders may decide\nnot to hold the shares of our Class A common stock they receive as a result of the Transaction. Other Wolt\nshareholders and Wolt Vested Optionholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in\nindividual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our Class A common stock they receive as a result of the\nTransaction. Any such sales of our Class A common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for\nour Class A common stock. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on\nthe market for, or liquidity of, the our Class A common stock, regardless of the actual operating performance of\nthe combined company.\nCompletion of the Transaction may trigger change in control, assignment or other provisions in certain agreements\nto which Wolt or its subsidiaries are a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business\nand results of operations.\nThe completion of the Transaction may trigger change in control, assignment and other provisions in certain\nagreements to which Wolt or its subsidiaries are a party. If DoorDash and Wolt are unable to negotiate waivers of,\nor consents under, those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the\nagreements, potentially terminating the agreements, seeking monetary damages or other remedies. Even if DoorDash\nand Wolt are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to\nrenegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to DoorDash. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may\nhave an adverse impact on the businesses, financial condition and results of operations of DoorDash following the\ncompletion of the transaction, or the ability to successfully integrate their respective businesses and/or execute\ntheir respective strategies.",

Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, delivery providers, or other third parties (individually or as\nclass actions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For\nsome matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses\nis not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a\nmaterial loss in excess of the amount recorded.\n60\nTable of Contents\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of third-party delivery providers on our\nplatform as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various\nlabor and other laws that would apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and\nclassification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various\nauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought\nunder PAGA and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the\nclassification of third-party delivery providers on our platform as independent contractors.\nIn November 2019, we filed an agreement to pay $40 million with the representatives of Dashers that had filed\ncertain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging\nworker misclassification of Dashers, or the Marciano settlement. These actions were filed by and on behalf of\nMassachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since August 2016. The settlement was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco on November 21, 2019. In April 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues with\nthe filed settlement agreement and requesting supplemental briefing from the parties. In June 2020, the parties\nsubmitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement agreement to the court. The amended settlement agreement\nincreased the total amount to be paid by us from $40 million to $41 million. In June 2020, the court issued a\ntentative ruling raising certain issues with the filed amended settlement agreement and requesting supplemental\nbriefing from the parties. In July 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement\nagreement to the court. In August 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff’s motion for\npreliminary approval of the amended settlement without prejudice and inviting the parties to file supplemental\nbriefing addressing the concerns raised by the court. In October 2020, we entered into an amended settlement\nagreement to increase the total amount to be paid by us from $41 million to $89 million. In November 2020, the\nparties submitted supplemental briefing and the amended settlement agreement to the court. In February 2021, the\ncourt issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of the amended settlement\nwithout prejudice. In April 2021, plaintiffs filed a notice of withdrawal of the motion for preliminary approval of\nthe settlement. In light of the court’s concern about the plaintiffs releasing various class claims that were not\noriginally pled in the Marciano action (which was filed as a PAGA-only case), the parties agreed not to seek a\nrelease of these claims in Marciano, but to instead present a new proposed settlement in Marko v DoorDash, Inc.,\nCase No. BC659841 (Los Angeles Super. Ct.), where the court had jurisdiction over the various class claims under\nthe Labor Code encompassed by the agreement. In April 2021, plaintiffs filed a revised settlement agreement with\nthe Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, or the Marko settlement. The total amount to be paid by us\nis $100 million. In January 2022, the court granted final approval of the Marko settlement which resolves claims\nunder PAGA and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in California for the period of August 30, 2016\nthrough December 31, 2020 and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in Massachusetts for the period\nof September 26, 2014 through March 31, 2021.\nMore than 35,000 delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have filed or expressed an\nintention to file arbitration demands against us that assert worker misclassification claims. As of December 31,\n2021, individual settlement agreements have been executed and amounts paid thereunder, in an aggregate amount of\napproximately $83 million, including attorneys’ fees, and covering approximately 31,000 delivery providers. We do\nnot admit any allegations of wrongdoing as part of the resolution of these matters.\nVarious other delivery providers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their\nclassification on our platform, as an independent contractor under federal and state law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual delivery\nproviders, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our\nindependent contractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code\nand the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary\ndamages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to\n61\nTable of Contents\nclassify Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however,\nthe possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including Canada and Australia. New laws and\nregulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in\nresponse to our industry and related technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was\nsigned into law in September 2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with\ncertain other companies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative titled Proposition 22 to\naddress AB 5 and preserve flexibility for delivery providers, which passed in November 2020, and which became\neffective in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor\ngroups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County Superior Court to compel the State of California not\nto enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as unconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the\nAlameda County Superior Court issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The\nCalifornia Attorney General, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of\nProposition 22 have filed notices of appeal to the California Court of Appeal. Proposition 22 remains in effect\npending further court proceedings.\nIn addition, several other states where we operate may adopt legislation similar to Proposition 22, which we would\nexpect to increase our costs in such jurisdictions, could result in lower order volumes if we charge higher fees\nand commissions as a result of such laws, and could also adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the\npassage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation have been and may in the future\nbe challenged and subject to litigation. Additionally, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards\nsimilar to AB 5 to determine worker classification.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nthe Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty and/or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to\ndefend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our\nbusiness practices, the classification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, compliance\nwith consumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation\ninsurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of\nthe State of California for payroll tax liabilities. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related\ngovernmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit,\nor inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly\nin the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or\nother action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs\nassociated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources,\nand other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\n62\nTable of Contents\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving delivery\nproviders who have been active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters\nrelated to accidents or other incidents involving delivery providers that utilize our platform. In many of these\nmatters, we believes we have meritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or\nincidents that individually, in our opinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and\nLegal Proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an\nadverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of\nmanagement resources, and other factors.",

Discussions\nof 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 are not included in this Annual Report on Form\n10-K and can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\nPart II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the SEC\non March 5, 2021.\nOverview\nWe have built a logistics and technology platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations\nof ease and immediacy. We built our products to serve the needs of three key constituents: merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers. We do this primarily through our Marketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable\nmerchants to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order\nfulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. Our Marketplace enables merchants to\nestablish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can\nfulfill this demand through delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by\nconsumers. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our platform in order to acquire new consumers and\ndrive incremental sales.\n65\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our revenue today, our Platform Services\nbusiness, which primarily consists of Drive and Storefront, offers services to help merchants facilitate sales\nthrough their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand\ngenerated through their own channels using our local logistics platform. Storefront enables merchants to create\ntheir own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand\naccess to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nWe currently operate our business in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, and Germany.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 33,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at\nthe public offering price of $102 per share. We received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our shares in\nthe IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. For additional information,\nsee Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent Developments\nOn November 9, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wolt. Headquartered in Helsinki, Finland,\nWolt is a leading local commerce platform with operations in 23 countries across Europe, Japan, and Israel. We\nexpect the acquisition of Wolt will increase our international scale, accelerate our product development, and\nimprove our investment efficiency. The closing is expected in the first half of 2022, subject to customary\nregulatory approvals and other closing conditions. We expect the acquisition of Wolt to increase our Marketplace\nGOV and revenue, as well as our costs and expenses.\nOn February 14, 2022, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an ordering and payment platform company\ndomiciled in the United States for approximately $90 million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The\ntransaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\nKey Business and Non-GAAP Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business\nand non-GAAP metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business\nplans, and make strategic decisions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except percentages)                              2019            2020            2021\nTotal Orders                                                    263             816           1,390\nMarketplace GOV                          $                    8,039       $  24,664       $  41,944\nContribution Profit (Loss)(1)            $                     -200       $     663       $   1,071\nContribution Margin(1)                                          -23  %           23  %           22  %\nContribution Profit (Loss) as a % of                             -2  %            3  %            3  %\nMarketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                       $                     -475       $     189       $     289\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)                                       -54  %            7  %            6  %\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                            -6  %            1  %            1  %\nGOV\n(1) Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. For more information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations to the most\ndirectly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures.\"\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed on the DoorDash platform, including those completed\nthrough our Marketplace and Platform Services businesses, over the period of measurement.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Total Orders increased to 1.4 billion, or 70% growth compared to the year\nended December 31, 2020 . The increase in Total Orders was driven by increased engagement of existing consumers,\nthe addition of new consumers, and an increase in the number of orders completed through Platform Services\nbusinesses.\n66\nTable of Contents\nMarketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplace,\nincluding taxes, tips 3 , and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass.\nMarketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does not include\nthe dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through Drive and\nStorefront.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Marketplace GOV increased to $41.9 billion, or 70% growth compared to the year\nended December 31, 2020, consistent with the growth in Total Orders.\nContribution Profit (Loss). 4 We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and\nmarketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,\nand (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Gross profit (loss) is\ndefined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and\namortization related to cost of revenue. We define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a\npercentage of revenue for the same period.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nI n the year ended December 31, 2021, Contribution Profit improved to $1.1 billion, compared to a Contribution\nProfit of $663 million in the year ended December 31, 2020, driven primarily by the growth in Marketplace GOV. In\nthe year ended December 31, 2021, Contribution Margin decreased to 22%, compared to 23% in the year ended December\n31, 2020, due to increases in Adjusted Cost of Revenue and Dasher acquisition costs.\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It\ndoes not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain\nexpenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss)\nis not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is\nnot a financial measure of total company profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total\ncompany profitability nor does it imply profitability for our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA. 5 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and\nregulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) a one-time non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract\nrelated to the issuance of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, (iii) loss on disposal of property\nand equipment, (iv) transaction-related expense, (v) impairment expenses, (vi) provision for income taxes, (vii)\ninterest income and expense, (viii) other income (expense), net, (ix) stock-based compensation expense and certain\npayroll tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that\nwe use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is\ncalculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $289 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $189\nmillion in the year ended December 31, 2020 , driven primarily by the growth in Marketplace GOV . In the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA Margin decreased to 6%, compared to 7% in the year ended December 31, 2020, due\nprimarily to increases in Adjusted Cost of Revenue and Dasher acquisition costs.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our\nMarketplace to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our Marketplace to arrange\nfor delivery services.\n3 Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n4 For more information about Contribution Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin, including the limitations of such\nmeasures, and a reconciliation of Contribution Profit (Loss) to gross profit (loss), the most directly comparable\nfinancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n5 For more information about Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, including the limitations of such measures\nand more detail on the specific adjustments, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly\ncomparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, as well as a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n67\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an agent for both partner merchants and\nconsumers. Our revenue therefore reflects commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers\nless (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which includes certain discounts and incentives\nprovided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer. Revenue from our Marketplace is recognized at\nthe point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of our\nMarketplace revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the\ncontractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the\nconsumer.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Platform Services business, which primarily\nconsists of our Drive and Storefront offerings. We generate revenue from Drive by collecting per-order fees from\nmerchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated\nthrough their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control\nof the merchant’s products.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of\nrebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, insurance expenses, and costs\nrelated to placing orders with non-partner merchants, and costs related to first party product sales, for which we\ntake control of inventory (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding merchants and Dashers, costs for\nproviding support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform infrastructure costs, and (iii)\npersonnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to our local operations, support,\nand other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses primarily include salary, bonus,\nbenefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined based on an allocation of shared\ncosts, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information technology costs, among all departments\nbased on employee headcount.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the\nreferrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing\nexpenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense\nincluding amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data\nanalytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to our platform, as well as expenses\nassociated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include\nlitigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nadministrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated\nwith fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, transaction-related expenses, bad debt\nexpense, and allocated overhead.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with\nour property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation primarily includes expenses associated with\nequipment for merchants, computer equipment and software, office equipment, and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized software and website development costs, as well as\nacquired intangible assets.\nInterest Income\n68\nTable of Contents\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs related to our revolving credit facility and payment-in-kind interest\non our Convertible Notes issued in February 2020.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency\nother than the functional currency and non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract liability (entered into\nand settled in the year ended December 31, 2019) in connection with the issuance of shares of our Series F\nredeemable convertible preferred stock.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes primarily consists of U.S. federal and state income tax and franchise tax, as well

These excluded costs and expenses consist\nof (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii) reserves for the collection of\nsales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) costs related to the settlement\nof an intellectual property matter, (iv) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including those\nrelated to worker classification and price controls, and (v) donations as part of our COVID-19 pandemic relief\nefforts. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nbecause (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting\nor forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such\nexpenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative\nand regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 and similar legislation.\n(2) Consists of impairment expense related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with our former\nheadquarters.\n(3) In connection with the issuance of shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, we committed\nto sell an existing investor shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock in a subsequent closing\nat the initial issuance price of the Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. We determined this commitment\nto be a forward contract, classified as a liability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis, with changes\nin fair value recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations.

Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, provides for a $300 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility maturing on August 7, 2025, increasing to $400 million in aggregate revolving commitments upon the\nconsummation of an IPO of our common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021. Loans under the credit facility bear\ninterest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the\nfederal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a\none-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. We are also\nobligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees,\nan upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants\nunder the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no amounts were drawn from the\ncredit facility.\nWe maintain letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December\n31, 2020 and 2021, we had $66 million and $60 million of issued letters of credit outstanding, respectively, of\nwhich $44 million and $39 million were issued from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nConvertible Notes\n76\nTable of Contents\nOn February 19, 2020, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to the\nConvertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated February 19, 2020, among us, Caviar, and the investors party thereto, or\nthe Note Investors. We received net proceeds of $333 million, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs and an\noriginal issue discount of $5 million. The interest rate under the Convertible Notes was 10.00% per annum, payable\nquarterly in arrears. In February 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible\nNotes in full for $375 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of shares of\nour Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $4.4 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion, and short-term marketable securities\nof $1.3 billion and long-term marketable securities of $650 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $320 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Marketable\nsecurities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $2.1\nbillion as of December 31, 2021. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may\nincur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may\nrequire additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nalong with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be\nsufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nOur material cash requirements relate to operating lease obligations for corporate office facility leases and\npurchase commitments for purchase of onboarding, technology platform infrastructure services and advertising\nservices. For Information on contractual obligations for operating leases, see Note 8 - Leases included in the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For information on non-cancellable\npurchase commitments as of December 31, 2021, see \"Non-cancelable Purchase Commitments\" section of Note 10 -\nCommitments and Contingencies included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)                                                     2019        2020         2021\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating    $                     -467    $    252    $     692\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                             -570        -192       -2,047\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing                         1,109       3,996         -483\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                —           2           -1\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash       $                       72    $  4,058    $  -1,839\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $692 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. This consisted of a\nnet loss of $468 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $486 million, non-cash\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $156 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets\nand accretion of operating lease liabilities of $52 million, non-cash bad debt expense of $36 million, non-cash\ninterest expense of $11 million related\n77\nTable of Contents\nto the convertible notes, and other non-cash expenses of $28 million. The net changes in operating assets and\nliabilities was the result of an increase of $595 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities,\nprimarily related to Dasher and merchant payable, insurance reserves, accrued operations related expenses, contract\nliabilities, and accrued advertising, an decrease of $85 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and\nan increase of $79 million in accounts payable, offset by an increase of $174 million in funds held at payment\nprocessors, an increase of $94 in accounts receivable, net, a decrease of $44 million for payments for operating\nlease liabilities, an increase of $51 in other assets and an decrease of $5 million in other liabilities. The\nincrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 was mainly due to the decrease in net loss and increases in non-cash expenses for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021.\nCash provided by operating activities was $252 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted of a\nnet loss of $461 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $322 million, non-cash\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $120 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets\nand accretion of operating lease liabilities of $40 million, non-cash interest expense of $31 million related to\nthe convertible notes, non-cash bad debt expense of $16 million, and other non-cash expenses of $18 million. The\nnet changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase of $587 million in accrued expenses\nand other current liabilities, primarily related to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and\nindirect taxes, accrued operations related expenses, Dasher and merchant payable, and contract liabilities, an\nincrease of $54 million in accounts payable, and an increase of $11 million in other liabilities, offset by an\nincrease of $248 million in accounts receivable, net, an increase of $96 million in funds held at payment\nprocessors, an increase of $96 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a decrease of $26 million for\npayments for operating lease liabilities, and an increase of $20 million in other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $2,047 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily\nconsisted of purchases of marketable securities of $2,344 million, purchases of non-marketable equity securities of\n$409 million, purchases of property and equipment of $129 million, and cash outflows for capitalized software and\nwebsite development costs of $108 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable\nsecurities of $944 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted\nof purchases of marketable securities of $593 million, purchases of property and equipment of $106 million, cash\noutflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $53 million, and cash paid for acquisitions, net\nof cash acquired, of $28 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $587\nmillion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $483 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which consisted of $333\nmillion of repayment of the convertible promissory notes, $172 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to\nnet share settlement of equity awards, and $10 million of payment of deferred offering costs, partially offset by\n$32 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash provided by financing activities was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of\n$3.3 billion of proceeds from issuance of common stock upon our IPO, net of underwriter discounts, $382 million of\nnet proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, $333 million of net proceeds from the\nissuance of convertible promissory notes, and $5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by\n$7 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $6 million of\npayment of deferred offering costs.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual\nresults, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\ncould be affected.\n78\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 . We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplace and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\nconsumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash.\nRevenue from our Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s\nproducts. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part\nof our Marketplace. Revenue generated from DashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the\ncontractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the\nconsumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants\nthat use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their\nown channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the\nmerchant’s products.\nOur local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a\nprincipal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation\nservice are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation\nservice and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have has determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplace. The consumer accesses the our local\nlogistics platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor does it\nobtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our\nrole with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to\nprospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and\ndelivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\nGift Cards\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through its Marketplace. Those gift cards have no expiration\ndate and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited history as to\nconsumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded as contract\nliabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is\nrecognized on a net\n79\nTable of Contents\nbasis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and\nDashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that we had developed sufficient historical evidence\nregarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have the ability to estimate the portion of\noutstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for which there is no legal obligation to remit\nthe value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. We\nrecognize the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the gift card\nredemptions. As a result of this change in estimate, we recorded $48 million of gift card breakage revenue during\nthe year ended December 31, 2021. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and\nhistorical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These\nare offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak\ndemand time.\nDasher referrals : We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new\nDasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers\nas incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of\nour platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in\nexcess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nPayments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions\nbelieved to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results\nmay differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we\nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if\nnew information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of\noperations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited\noperational history, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry\nclaim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected\nloss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information\nbecomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our\nreserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.\nWe review these provisions on a\n80\nTable of Contents\nquarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,\nrulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income and loss from our\ninternational businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued strengthening of the\nU.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included in our\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which\nis part of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\n81\nTable of Contents",

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\n83\nTable of Contents\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance\nwhich include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury\nand physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have\nbeen incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2021 was $143 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter.\nThe evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and\nexpected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized\nskill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s retained insurance\ndeductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by\nselecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 1,

INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”), is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The\nCompany provides a local logistics platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of\nease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.\nThe Company’s local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company operates the\nDoorDash Marketplace, which enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting\nthem with consumers (the “Marketplace”). Merchants can fulfill this demand with independent contractors who use the\nCompany’s platform to deliver orders (“Dashers”). As part of the Marketplace, the Company also offers Pickup, which\nallows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees,\nas well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the Company’s platform with large group orders and\ncatering orders for businesses and events. The Marketplace also includes DashPass, the Company’s membership\nproduct, which was formerly referred to the Company's subscription product, which provides consumers with unlimited\naccess to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees. In addition to the Marketplace, the\nCompany offers Platform Services, which primarily includes DoorDash Drive (\"Drive\"), a white-label logistics\nservice that enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this\ndemand using the Company’s local logistics platform, and DoorDash Storefront (\"Storefront\") that enables merchants\nto create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers\non-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in which it issued and sold\n33million shares of its Class A common stock at the public offering price of $ 102.00per share. The Company\nreceived net proceeds of $ 3.3billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all shares of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock automatically converted into 239million shares of its common stock. Additionally, immediately prior\nto the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which\nauthorizes a total of 6.0billion shares of Class A common stock, 200million shares of Class B common stock,\n2.0billion shares of Class C common stock, and 600million shares of preferred stock. Upon the filing of the Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 285million shares of the Company’s common stock were automatically\nreclassified into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Reclassification”).\nImmediately after the Reclassification and prior to the completion of the IPO, a total of 31million shares of Class\nA common stock held by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for\nan equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a\nresult, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has three classes of authorized common stock: Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, of which Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nThe Company granted certain employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with both service-based and liquidity event-\nrelated performance vesting conditions (\"IPO Vested RSUs\"). Upon the consummation of the Company’s IPO, the Company\nrecognized $ 279million of stock-based compensation expense for IPO Vested RSUs as the performance vesting\ncondition was satisfied. One share of Class A common stock for each of the IPO Vested RSUs was settled and\ndelivered on June 7, 2021 (the “IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date”). The future tax benefits on settlement of the\nabove RSUs is not expected to be material as currently the Company has established valuation allowances to reduce\nits net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nTo meet the related tax withholding requirements related to IPO Vested RSUs, for stockholders who elected to net\nshare settle, the Company withheld 65,058shares of Class A common stock subject to the vesting of the IPO Vested\nRSUs and paid $ 7million to the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations as well as any\nincome tax withholding obligations arising as a result of settlement of such shares. Certain employees elected to\nreceive a short-term loan from the Company, with interest that accrued at the applicable federal rate. The short-\nterm loan extended to employees totaled\n91\nTable of Contents\n$ 10million, which was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of shares into the market on the IPO Vested RSU\nSettlement Date.\nStock Splits\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved a five-for-one\nforward stock split of the Company’s common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock (collectively, the\n“Capital Stock”), which became effective on November 9, 2020. The authorized number of each class and series of\nCapital Stock was proportionally increased in accordance with the five-for-one stock split and the par value of\neach class of Capital Stock was not adjusted as a result of this forward stock split. All common stock, redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, warrants, and per share information presented within these\nconsolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this forward stock split on a retroactive basis for\nall periods presented.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to\nan individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.\nThe CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it\noperates in onereportable segment.See Note 3 for revenue by geography. Long-lived assets, which consist of property\nand equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, located outside of the United States were $ 15million\nand $ 28million a s of December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related\ndisclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe period presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses,\ngift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website development\ncosts, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other financial instruments,\nvaluation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting,\ninsurance reserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as\nincurred.\n92\nTable of Contents\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Restricted cash\nconsists of collateral provided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance\npolicies.As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the restricted cash balances were not material and were included in\nother assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, and corporate bonds. The Company invests in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities and limits\nthe concentration of its investment in any particular security. Securities with maturities greater than three\nmonths, but less than one year, are included in current assets and securities with maturities greater than one year\nare included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All marketable securities are classified as\navailable-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the\nCompany evaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors\nconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the\namortized cost basis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically\nrelated to the security, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\nWhen a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the\ndebt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be\nrecorded. As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, no allowance of credit losses related to marketable securities was\nrecorded. Unrealized losses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nFunds held at payment processors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for transactions with\nmerchants and consumers, as well as funds transferred to payment processors for Dasher payout.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on the Company’s assessment of\nthe collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a\ncollective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer’s expected ability to pay and\ncollection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged\nagainst the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\n93\nTable of Contents\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.Disposals were not material for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment\nunder the long-lived asset model described under “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2021 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Noimpairment charge was recorded in any\nof the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in and does not\nexercise significant influence over the investee are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for\nsame or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment.\nThe carrying value is not adjusted for the Company’s non-marketable equity securities if there are no observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment.\nIn 2021, the Company made investments in non-marketable equity securities of $ 409million in cash for preferred\nshares of private companies including an investment of $ 395million in cash for preferred shares of a grocery\ndelivery platform company. All those investments were accounted for using the measurement alternative.\nThere are no adjustments or impairment associated with the Company’s non-marketable equity securities during 2021.\nThe Company does not have any realized or unrealized gains or losses on non-marketable equity securities as of and\nfor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurred costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the\npost implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform\nare capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and\ncommitted project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\nintended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized\nand expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows.\n94\nTable of Contents\nAssets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company recognized impairment charges of $ 11million and $\n1million, respectively, related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with its former headquarters,\nwhich the Company subleased to another company.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited\noperational history, the Company utilizes assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward\nrelevant industry claim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement\npatterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience\ndevelops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from the Company’s estimates, which\ncould result in losses over the Company’s reserved amounts.During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021,\nthe Company recorded additions to the insurance reserves of $ 12million, $ 63million and $ 134million,\nrespectively.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized\ngains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign\nsubsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into U.S.\ndollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are\ntranslated using average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.\nPrior to November 2020, RSUs granted by the Company vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting\ncondition, which is typically four years, and a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition. The\nliquidity event-related performance vesting condition was achieved upon the consummation of the Company's IPO, and\nthe Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $ 279million as of the IPO date for those\nRSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied. Stock-based compensation related to the\nremaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will\nbe recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. Since November\n2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award (as discussed further in Note 12), the Company only granted\nRSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of\n95\nTable of Contents\na service-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award (as defined below) that includes a market condition, the fair value of the award was\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-based compensation is recorded over the\nderived service period, using the accelerated attribution method. If the stock price goals are met sooner than the\nderived service period, the Company will adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect the cumulative\nexpense associated with the vested award. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, regardless of whether\nthe stock price goals are achieved.\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options and RSUs has\nhistorically been determined by the Company’s board of directors as there is no public market for the underlying\ncommon stock. The Company’s board of directors determined the fair value of the Company’s common stock by\nconsidering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-party valuations of its\ncommon stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including the IPO), the Company’s operating and\nfinancial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry specific economic outlook, amongst\nother factors. After the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock is determined\nbased on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") closing price on the date of grant.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net\namount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both\npositive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of\nfuture taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\n96\nTable of Contents\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due\nto their short maturities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes\nthat the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits\npurchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit\nlosses historically.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher payouts. Payment processors are\nfinancial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. The Company\nretains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processors, which are included in funds held at\npayment processors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be remitted to\nDashers and merchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the Company pre-\nauthorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering.As of December 31, 2020, three entities in dividually accounted for 20%, 14%, and 10% of accounts\nreceivable, net, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, two entities in dividually accounted for 15% and 14% of\naccounts receivable, net, respectively. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through the Marketplace and the related commissions charged to\npartner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a\ncontractual agreement with the Company. Revenue from the Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership fees paid\nby consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of the Marketplace. Revenue generated from the Company’s\nDashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one monthto\none yeardepending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, the Company also generates\nrevenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its local logistics platform\nto arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is\nrecognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\nlogistics platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local logistics platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\nThe Company’s local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore\n97\nTable of Contents\nconsidered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service\nand the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately.\nFurther, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature\nof the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually,\nrather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on\nwhether it controls each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace\ntransactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through the Marketplace. The consumer accesses the Company’s\nlocal logistics platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked\nup from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the products prior to\nthem being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer\nnor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of its delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the\nCompany’s role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered\nto prospective Dashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of its transactions with end-users, the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of\nproducts and delivery services, thus the Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from\nconsumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nDasher payout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for\ncertain referral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a\nreduction in Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled on a weekly basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nThe Company also provides value-add services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. Revenue generated\nfrom such services is not material in all periods presented.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through the Marketplace. Those gift cards have no\nexpiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited\nhistory as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded\nas contract liabilities until consumers used the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are\nredeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less\namounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that it\nhad developed sufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have\nthe ability to estimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for\nwhich there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as\nunclaimed or abandoned property. The Company recognizes the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the\npattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. As a result of this change in estimate, the Company\nrecorded $ 48million of gift card breakage revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Estimating future\nbreakage rates requires judgment based on current and historical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage\nrates may vary from the estimate.\n98\nTable of Contents\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local logistics platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below:\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.Advertising expenses were $ 446million, $ 698million and $ 1.2billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per common share following the two-class method required for multiple classes of\ncommon stock and participating securities. The Company considers its previously outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to be participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to common\nstockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and participating securities\nbased upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been\ndistributed. The holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in\npreference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any\nremaining earnings would be\n99\nTable of Contents\ndistributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common stock pro rata on an as-\nconverted basis. These holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock are not contractually\nobligated to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, the Company’s net losses were not allocated to these\nparticipating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock,\nClass B common stock, and Class C common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly,\nthe Class A common stock and Class B common stock shared proportionately in the Company’s net losses. Noshares of\nClass C common stock were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2021. Prior to the completion of the\nIPO, there were noshares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the\nperiod. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic\nnet loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs that have not\nbeen settled have been included in the appropriate common share class used to calculate basic net loss per share.\nUpon completion of the Company's IPO, all of the Company’s outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred\nstock were automatically converted into 239million shares of common stock and their carrying amount reclassified\ninto stockholders' (deficit) equity.As of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there were noshares of redeemable convertible\npreferred stock issued and outstanding.\nDeferred Offering Costs\nDeferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, consulting, accounting, and other fees relating\nto the anticipated sale of the Company’s common stock in the IPO, were initially capitalized and recorded in other\nassets on the consolidated balance sheets.After the IPO, all deferred offering costs were reclassified into\nstockholders' (deficit) equity as a reduction of the IPO proceeds on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nROU assets represents the Company's right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresents the Company's obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease. The Company has elected the\npractical expedient not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with terms of twelve\nmonths or less. Expense related to short-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as\nincurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. ROU assets are recognized as the lease\nliability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the\nfuture lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real\nestate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating\nlease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases\nconsist of equipment leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and activities related to finance leases were not\nmaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from fourto five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no\nresidual value guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ntypically borrow on a collateralized basis, it\n100\nTable of Contents\nuses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for collateralization, current available yield curves,\nand the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\") 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740):\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\", which eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for\nintra-period tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition\nof deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the\naccounting for franchise taxes and enacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for\ntransactions that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill. For public business entities, this standard is\neffective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early\nadoption is permitted. The Company adopted 2019-12 on January 1, 2021. The cumulative effect upon adoption was not\nmaterial to its consolidated financial statement.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and\nContract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which requires an acquirer in a business combination to\nrecognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the\nprocess of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the update on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue\nThe following tables present the Company’s revenue disaggregated by offering and by geographical region.\nRevenue by offering was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019        2020        2021\nCore business    $                      876    $  2,886    $  4,888\nOther revenue                             9           —           —\nTotal revenue    $                      885    $  2,886    $  4,888\nCore business is primarily comprised of Marketplace, which includes Pickup and DoorDash for Work, and Drive.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of DashPass, the\naddress of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019        2020        2021\nUnited States    $                      877    $  2,875    $  4,877\nInternational                             8          11          11\nTotal revenue    $                      885    $  2,886    $  4,888\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers\nand merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized over\ntime. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was as follows\n(in millions):\n101\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31, 2021\nBeginning balance                             $                           108\nAddition to contract liabilities                                        1,212\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)(3)                             -1,137\nEnding balance                                $                           183\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplace. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 22million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n(3) During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorde d $ 48million o f gift card breakage revenue,\nwhich represented the estimate of cumulative gift card breakage through December 31, 2021 based on the Company's\naccounting policy discussed in Note 2.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense\nand amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue,\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A summary of activities\nrelated to deferred contract costs was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020       2021\nBeginning balance                          $                        6    $    21    $    43\nCapitalization of deferred contract                                19         32         39\ncosts\nAmortization of deferred contract costs                            -4        -10        -20\nEnding balance                             $                       21    $    43    $    62\nDeferred contract costs, current           $                        4    $    16    $    25\nDeferred contract costs, non-current                               17         27         37\nTotal deferred contract costs              $                       21    $    43    $    62\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable and changes were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020       2021\nBeginning balance                          $                        —    $     2    $    13\nAdditions to the provision for expected                             2         16         37\ncredit losses\nWriteoffs charged against the allowance                             —         -5        -11\nEnding balance                             $                        2    $    13    $    39\n102\nTable of Contents\n4. Acquisition\nIn December 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of a technology manufacturing\ncompany, which was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The total purchase consideration was\napproximately $ 30million, of which $ 3million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The\ntotal purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed,\nwhich primarily consisted of $ 22million of intangible assets. The intangible assets acquired consisted entirely of\nexisting technology, which has an estimated remaining useful life of 8years as of the date of the acquisition .\nAdditionally, the Company recorde d $ 10million of goodwill, which represented the excess of the purchase price\nover the net assets acquired.\nThis acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\n5.

Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2022 and 2035. Certain\nof these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant\nallowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term. Lease\ncosts, net of sublease income, was $ 29million, $ 46million, and $ 66million during the years ended December 31,\n2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively.\nIn June 2019, the Company subleased its previous headquarters office space to another company (the “Sublessee”).\nThe sublease required Sublessee to pay 100% of any rent and other related expenses due and payable under the\nexisting lease with the landlord (the “Head Lease”), however the Company was not relieved from its legal obligation\nto the landlord under the Head Lease. Accordingly, an operating lease liability and an operating lease ROU asset\nwas reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to the Head Lease. Prior to April 2020, all\npayments due and payable by Sublessee were made timely.\nIn early April 2020, as a result of a disruption to Sublessee’s business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sublessee\ninformed the Company that it would not be making any future monthly rent payments. Accordingly, the Company ceased\nrecognizing sublease income beginning in April 2020, and further determined that an impairment existed and\nrecognized an impairment charge of $ 11million and $ 1million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2021,\nrespectively, reducing the carrying value of the ROU asset to its estimated fair value. Fair value of the ROU asset\nwas estimated using an income-approach based on forecasted future cash flows expected to be derived from the\nproperty based on current sublease market rent.\nThe components of lease costs related to the Company’s operating leases included in the consolidated statements of\noperations for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020       2021\nOperating lease cost     $                       22    $    40    $    52\nShort-term lease cost                            10         11         17\nSublease income                                  -3         -5         -3\nTotal lease cost         $                       29    $    46    $    66\n107\nTable of Contents\nLease terms and discount rates for operating leases were as follows:\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2020            2021\nWeighted-average remaining lease term            10.7            9.77\n(in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate                  8.06%           6.81%\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows for operating         $                       32    $    46\nleases\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new\nlease liabilities\nOperating leases                           $                       69    $   164\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had entered into long term non-cancelable real estate lease contracts\nof $ 120million and $ 19million, respectively, for which leases have not yet commenced. Such leases are not\nincluded in the operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the future minimum lease payments required under operating leases were as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ending December 31,                             Amount\n2022                                                     53\n2023                                                     65\n2024                                                     63\n2025                                                     60\n2026                                                     58\nThereafter                                              293\nTotal future minimum lease payments                     592\nLess: Lease not commenced                               -19\nLess: Imputed interest                                 -165\nLess: Tenant improvement receivable                      -9\nPresent value of future minimum lease payments    $     399\nFuture minimum sublease income as of December 31, 2021 is $ 7million.\n9. Promissory Notes\nIn February 2020, the Company issued convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 340million with an\ninitial maturity date in March 2025 (the “2020 Notes”). The Company received net proceeds of $ 333million, net of $\n2million in debt issuance costs, reflecting an original issue discount on the principal of $ 5million. The interest\nrate is 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.\nIn February 2021, the Company repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the 2020 Notes in full for $\n375million.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a\n108\nTable of Contents\npotential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring recognition of a loss accrual, or whether\nthe potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential disclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,\nand such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex\nOperations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”) . The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that\nwas signed into law in September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased\nlegal proceedings and related expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business\nmodel and operations. Further, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set\nforth in Dynamex to determine worker classification.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nconducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the\nclassification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, and other matters. For example, the\ncompany is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of California for payroll tax\nliabilities. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors,\nand thus plans to vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on\nthe merits is uncertain.\nIn October 2019, the Company made an offer, and in November 2019 it filed a settlement agreement, of $ 40million\nwith the representatives of Dashers that had filed actions in the States of California and Massachusetts in order\nto settle claims under the Private Attorney General Act and class action claims alleging worker misclassification\nof Dashers against the Company. These actions were filed by and on behalf of Massachusetts Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since August\n2016. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be\npaid by the Company from $ 40million to $ 41million. In October 2020, the Company entered into an amended\nsettlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by the Company from $ 41million to $ 89million. In\nApril 2021, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement increasing the total amount to be paid by the\nCompany to $ 100million. In January 2022, the settlement received final approval and the company anticipates the\npayout of $ 100million in 2022.\nIn March 2020, the Company reached an agreement to resolve worker misclassification claims associated with certain\nDashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the Company. Under the\nagreement, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers were eligible for settlement payments, subject to a\nthreshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements. In July 2020, the\nCompany transferred $ 69million into an escrow account to be paid to claimants and claimants’ attorneys if a\nminimum number of claimants agreed to release their claims against the Company by the date specified within the\nsettlement agreement. In December 2020, the number of claimants who agreed to release their claims against the\nCompany exceeded the minimum, and the Company was committed to release the settlement amount in the escrow account\nto claimants and claimants' attorneys. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the $ 69million in the escrow account\nwas fully distributed to the claimants and claimants' attorneys.\nIn July and August 2020, the Company reached additional agreements to resolve worker misclassification claims\nassociated with certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the\nCompany. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers were eligible for settlement\npayments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements.\nThe aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these individual settlement\nagreements, including attorneys’ fees, was $ 14million, which was fully paid in the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees\nin violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This\naction is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the Company from continuing\nto classify Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred;\nhowever, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\n109\nTable of Contents\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these\nindemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the\nindividual.\nNoliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of onboarding, data\nprocessing, technology platform infrastructure, and advertising services. These purchase commitments are not\nrecorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 as the Company has not\nyet received the related services. As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-\ncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2022                                   151\n2023                                   152\n2024                                     5\n2025                                     3\nTotal future minimum payments    $     311\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provides for a $\n300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. Loans under the credit facility bear\ninterest, at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of\nthe federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a\none-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is\nalso obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit\nfees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative\ncovenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as\ncustomary negative covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions,\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and\nacquisitions, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn August 2020, the Company amended and restated its existing revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide\nfor $ 100million of incremental revolving loan commitments, effective upon consummation of an IPO of the Company’s\ncommon stock on or prior to August 7, 2021, for total revolving commitments of $ 400million. The amendment and\nrestatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from November 19, 2024 to August 7,\n2025.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2020 and 2021, noamounts were drawn from the credit facility.\nThe Company maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2020 and 2021, the Company had $ 66million and $ 60million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $ 44million and $ 39million were issued from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state and local tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect tax\nmatters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves when they become probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the\namounts ultimately paid, if\n110\nTable of Contents\nany, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is\nreasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will receive additional assessments by various\ntax authorities in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments could result in changes to the Company's reserves\nrelated to positions on sales and indirect tax filings. In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company favorably\nresolved a sales and indirect tax exposure resulting in a $ 29million reduction of liabilities previously reserved.\n11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock purchase agreement\npursuant to which it issued a total of 8,321,395shares of Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock at $\n45.9062per share for gross proceeds of $ 382million. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material.\nThe Company previously issued Series A-1, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, and Series G\nprior to 2020. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on December 9, 2020, all outstanding shares of the\nCompany’s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate of 239,269,631shares of Class A common\nstock.\nThe following table summarizes the redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the\nconversion into common stock, and the rights and preferences of the Company’s respective series preceding the\nCompany’s IPO in December 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share\ndata):\nShares                                Per Share        Aggregate\nShares    Issued and          Issuance             Conversion       Liquidati…       Carrying\nSeries        Authorized    Outstandi…             Price                  Price       Preference          Value\nSeries A-1        13,330        13,330    $         0.15          $        0.15    $           2    $         7\nSeries A          27,159        27,159              0.73                   0.73               20             20\nSeries B           7,925         7,925              5.68                   5.48               45             45\nSeries C          26,839        26,839              4.79                   4.79              128            128\nSeries D          98,008        98,008              5.51    -1             5.51              540            535\nSeries E          18,055        18,055             13.85                  13.85              250            250\nSeries F          18,186        18,186             22.48                  22.48              409            476\nSeries G          21,165        21,165             37.94                  37.94              803            803\nSeries H           9,351         8,316             45.91                  45.91              382            382\nTotal            240,018       238,983                                             $       2,579    $     2,646\n(1) The issuance price for Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock was $ 5.50688, except for shares issued\nvia the conversion of certain of the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2017, for which the\nconversion price was $ 4.78778per share.\nForward Contract In Connection with Issuance of Series F Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn February 2019, the Company issued a total of 13,736,615shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock\nat $ 22.4751per share for gross proceeds of $ 309million. To accommodate the timing of regulatory approvals\nrequired by an existing investor (who did not participate in the initial issuance of Series F redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock), the Company committed to sell 4,449,370shares of Series F redeemable convertible\npreferred stock at $ 22.4751per share for gross proceeds of $ 100million to this investor in a subsequent closing,\nwhich ultimately occurred in May 2019. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material. At the date of the\ninitial closing, the Company determined that the commitment to defer the sale of shares of Series F redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock to this investor represented a freestanding instrument that should be classified as a\nliability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis, with changes in fair value recognized in other expense,\nnet in the consolidated statements of operations. The initial measurement of the liability at its fair value of $\n1million was recorded with a corresponding reduction recognized in additional paid-in capital as a deemed dividend\ndistributed to the investor. Immediately prior to the subsequent closing in May 2019, the fair value of the\nliability was determined to be $ 68million, resulting in an expense of $ 67million recorded to other (expense)\nincome, net in the consolidated statements of operations which was attributable to the increase in the fair value\nof Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. Upon the subsequent closing, the carrying amount of the\nliability was reclassified to mezzanine equity.\nThe fair value of the liability (valued as a forward contract) at issuance and as of subsequent closing was\ndetermined with the following assumptions:\n111\nTable of Contents\nAs of                 As of\nFebruary 22,               May 14,\n2019                  2019\nCurrent forward price per share             $         22.48          $      37.76\nContractual forward price per share         $         22.48          $      22.48\nRisk-free rate                                         2.46     %            2.41  %\nExpected years until subsequent closing                      0.23               —\nPresent value of contractual forward        $         22.35          $      22.48\nprice per share\nValue of the forward contract per share     $          0.13          $      15.28\nNumber of preferred shares issued in the          4,449,370             4,449,370\nsubsequent closing\nFair value of forward contract              $             1          $         68\nliability(in millions)\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there was nopreferred stock issued and outstanding.\n12. Common Stock\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\nStock options issued and outstanding        December 31, 2020    December 31, 2021\nunder the 2014 Plan                                    33,802               19,115\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 and 2020               34,939               27,556\nPlan\nRemaining shares available for future                  32,210               42,196\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                 6,499                6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                                 107,450               95,366\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (\"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based awards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of\nshares of common stock available for issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014 Plan.\nAll outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to the\nterms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock\nappreciation\n112\nTable of Contents\nrights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the Company's\nemployees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are forfeited,\ncanceled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available for\nissuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved for\nissuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on January 1,\n2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total number of all\nclasses of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase,\nor (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to the applicable January\n1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nthe Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten\nyears(or five yearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at\nprices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the\nexercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110%\nof the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest\nover four years.\nRSUs\nPrior to November 2020 , the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of both service-based and\nliquidity event-related performance vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards\ngenerally is satisfied over four years. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied\nupon the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition\nwas achieved upon the effectiveness of the Company’s IPO, resulting in the Company recording cumulative stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 279million for IPO Vested RSUs. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining\nservice-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will be recorded\nover the remaining requisite service period. Since November 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award\ndiscussed below, the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition\nwhich is generally four years.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the day\nCompany’s IPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches\nthat are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share,\neach of which are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day trading period\nduring the performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if\nthe Company achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\n113\nTable of Contents\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided\nthat Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\nThe Company recorded $ 12million and $ 112million of stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO\nPerformance Award during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2021,\nunrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 289million.\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 and 2020 Plans and related information was as follows (in millions, except\nshare amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                    Average\nShares       Weighted-    Remaining\nShares             subject to         Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nAvailable                Options        Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nfor Grant            Outstanding           Price    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December       32,210                 33,802    $       2.42                 5.92    $      4,744\n31, 2020\nShares authorized            15,925                      —\nOptions granted                   —                      —    $          —\nOptions exercised                 —                -14,642    $       2.18                                2,329\nOptions forfeited                45                    -45    $       4.08\nRSUs granted                 -8,217                      —\nRSUs forfeited                1,382                      —\nShares withheld\nrelated to net share            851                      —\nsettlement, returned\nto the 2020 Plan\nBalance as of December       42,196                 19,115    $       2.60                 4.59    $      2,797\n31, 2021\nExercisable as of                                   17,690    $       2.23                 4.41    $      2,595\nDecember 31, 2021\nVested and expected to\nvest as of                                          19,115    $       2.60                 4.59    $      2,797\nDecember 31, 2021\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock as of the respective period-end dates.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021\nwas $ 47million, $ 129million, and $ 2.3billion, respectively.

A\ntotal of 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each\nfiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any)\noccurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of\nthe outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or\n(iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\n115\nTable of Contents\nThe ESPP includes two components: a component that allows the Company to make offerings intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code and a component that allows the Company to make offerings not intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code to designated companies. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows\neligible employees to contribute (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the\nadministrator) an amount established by the administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A\ncommon stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of December 31, 2020 and 2021, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such\nperiod will begin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n13.

Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax\nassets is assessed periodically based on the ASC 740 more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. This\nassessment considers matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The evaluation of the recoverability of\nthe deferred tax assets requires that the Company weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion\nthat it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The\nweight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Due to the\nlack of U.S. earnings history, the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation\nallowance. Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $ 154million, $ 97million and $ 1,041million in the years\nended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n4,125million and $ 3,265million, respectively. Of the $ 4,125million of federal net operating losses, $\n4,042million is carried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80% of taxable income. The remaining federal and\nstate net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and 2024, respectively.\nThe Company also had $ 209million of federal and $ 114million of California research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards as of December 31, 2021. The federal research and development tax credits expire in varying amounts\nstarting in 2033. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited\nin the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended, and similar state tax law. Based on the most recent analysis, the Company does not anticipate a current\nlimitation on the tax attributes.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and 2021 were $ 7million and $\n69million, respectively, of tax benefits, that, if recognized, majority would result in adjustments to the\nvaluation allowance. The Company does not anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax\npositions existing at December 31, 2021 will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\n117\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020       2021\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                        3    $     7    $     7\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                                4          3         62\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                  —         -3          —\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                        7    $     7    $    69\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for income taxes, which were immaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as\nforeign jurisdictions. The Company’s income tax returns generally remain subject to examination by United States\nfederal and state and foreign tax authorities.\n14. Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock\nand participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock share equally in the Company’s net losses. Before the IPO, the Company’s outstanding\nsecurities also included convertible preferred stock. The holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock did not\nhave a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses, and as a result, net losses were not allocated to\nthese securities.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders during the periods presented. The shares issued in the IPO and the shares of Class A common stock\nissued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock in the IPO, as well as\nvested RSUs that have not been settled are included in the table below weighted for the period outstanding in the\nyears ended December 31, 2020 and 2021 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per\nshare data):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019          2020                        2021\nCommon       Class A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nNet loss                     $                     -667    $     -446    $      -15    $     -424    $      -44\nLess: Deemed dividend to\npreferred                                            -1             —             —             —             —\nstockholders\nNet loss attributable to\ncommon                       $                     -668    $     -446    $      -15    $     -424    $      -44\nstockholders\nWeighted-average number\nof shares\noutstanding used to\ncompute net loss per                             43,252        60,422         1,968       305,500        31,347\nshare attributable to\ncommon\nstockholders, basic and\ndiluted\nNet loss per share\nattributable to              $                   -15.44    $    -7.39    $    -7.39    $    -1.39    $    -1.39\ncommon stockholders,\nbasic and diluted\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019      2020      2021\nRedeemable convertible preferred stock                    230,953         —         —\n(on an as-converted basis)\nStock options to purchase common stock                     36,247    33,802    19,115\nUnvested restricted stock units(1)                         15,924    17,987    17,139\nConvertible promissory notes                                    —     2,595         —\nTotal                                                     283,124    54,384    36,254\n(1) The CEO Performance Award is excluded from the above table because the Company Stock Price Target had not been\nmet as of December 31, 2020 and 2021.\n15. 401(k) Plan\n118\nTable of Contents\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion\nof their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not make contributions for\neligible employees.\n16. Subsequent Events\nOn February 14, 2022, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire an ordering and payment platform\ncompany domiciled in the United States for approximately $ 90million in cash, subject to customary adjustments. The\ntransaction is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\n119\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer\n(“certifying officers”), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our certifying officers have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2021.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management, under the oversight of our Board\nof Directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations\nof internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
