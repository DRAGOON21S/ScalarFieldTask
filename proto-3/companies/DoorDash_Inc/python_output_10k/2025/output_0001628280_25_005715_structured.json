          "content": "Item 1. Business\nOUR BUSINESS\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to do this by providing services that reduce friction in\nlocal commerce and help merchants better connect with consumers in their communities. Our primary offerings include\nthe DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace (our \"Marketplaces\"), and our Commerce Platform.\nOur Marketplaces operate in over 30 countries, including the United States, and account for the vast majority of\nour revenue today. Our Marketplaces serve three primary constituents: merchants, consumers, and the independent\ncontractors who use our platform to generate earnings, or \"Dashers 1 .\"\nOur Marketplaces provide an integrated suite of services that help merchants establish an online presence, connect\nwith consumers in their communities, and solve mission-critical challenges, such as customer acquisition, demand\ngeneration, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We typically earn a fee\nfrom merchants for the services we provide based on the size of each transaction. We also offer advertising as a\nvalue-added service through our Marketplaces to help merchants and consumer packaged goods companies increase\nconsumer engagement and drive incremental revenue.\nConsumers access our Marketplaces through our apps and websites to discover, engage with, and purchase goods from\nmerchants in their communities. We seek to attract and retain consumers based primarily on the selection,\nconvenience, quality, affordability, and service we provide. We typically charge consumers fees for each\ntransaction, inclusive of a fixed delivery fee and a service fee that varies based on the size of the transaction.\nOur Marketplaces also offer our consumer membership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, which aim to lower transactional\nfriction by reducing the delivery and service fees we charge, while providing additional membership benefits. In\nDecember 2024, our Marketplaces served over 42 million monthly active users 2 and, as of December 31, 2024, we had\nover 22 million DashPass and Wolt+ members.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer our Commerce Platform, which is a suite of services that help merchants\ngrow, run, and operate their businesses on their own channels. DoorDash Drive On-Demand and Wolt Drive (together,\n\"Drive\") are white-label delivery fulfillment services that generate the majority of revenue within our Commerce\nPlatform. In addition to Drive, we also provide services within our Commerce Platform that help merchants establish\nonline ordering, build branded mobile apps, enable tableside order and pay, and improve customer support.\nFor Dashers, our Marketplaces and Drive provide opportunities to generate income that helps them achieve their\ngoals. Dashers choose if, when, and where to dash, which tasks to accept, as well as how frequently and for how\nlong to dash each time they choose to do so. We typically pay Dashers based on the amount of time they are active\non our platform or the number of tasks they complete and the time, distance, and desirability associated with each\ntask. We seek to attract Dashers primarily based on the accessibility, flexibility, and earnings opportunities we\nprovide.\nWe believe our business achieves its greatest benefits when we provide attractive services for each of our key\nconstituents. Consequently, to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with an expanding suite of\nservices that help them build and grow successful omnichannel businesses; consumers with a broad selection of\nmerchants and products to choose from, consistent and high-quality experiences, and affordability that drives\nincreased adoption; and Dashers with unique opportunities that compete effectively for their time and effort with\nevery task.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services.\n1 Dashers that use our DoorDash Marketplace and Wolt Marketplace are referred to as \"DoorDash Dashers\" and \"Wolt\ncourier partners,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplaces in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2024.\n6\nTable of Contents\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants and\nproducts available, the quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our\nplatform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, overall quality of the dashing\nexperience, and earnings potential.\nIn particular, local food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and\nintensely competitive. Globally, we compete with other local on-demand delivery companies, including Uber Eats,\nJust Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, and other local incumbents. We also compete with merchants that have their own\nonline ordering platforms, online ordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets,\ngrocers and grocery delivery services, convenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies\nthat provide merchant delivery services. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such\nas take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers. As we continue to expand\ninto additional verticals, we may compete or come in closer competition with additional businesses with substantial\nresources, users, and brand power.\nFor additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “ Risk\nFactors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete\neffectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. ”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had over 23,700 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants.\nCertain international employees are subject to statutory collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced\nany work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social\nprogress. In 2024, 8 million people dashed 3 , earning a total of over $18 billion.\nWe believe access and choice are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an\nopportunity to earn incrementally in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors, we\nmust compete for their time and effort with every task. We compete against other earnings opportunities, other\nsources of capital like loans or credit cards, as well as alternative uses of time like doing errands or leisure.\nBecause of this competition, we must make dashing attractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices\navailable. Specifically, we strive to make dashing positive based on:\nAccessibility : We believe the barriers to entry in dashing are very low. Where permitted by applicable law,\nprospective Dashers must pass a background check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or car.\nPeople who qualify to become Dashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up. We\nknow of no other earnings opportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\nFlexibility : Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash\nfor, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earnings needs. It also allows\nDashers to generate earnings around other commitments in their lives, which often include full or part-time jobs,\nschool, parenting, or commitments to care for family or friends.\n3 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in 2024.\n7\nTable of Contents\nEarnings : We must provide Dashers with opportunities to earn that are competitive with alternative opportunities\nand commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of earnings, we provide tools that\nimprove immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by Dashers.\nService : We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is\naccessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and\npractices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ngeographies we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and\nretain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we\namplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the\ntools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2024, we had 244 issued U.S. patents, 25 patents issued in non-U.S. jurisdictions, 54 U.S. patent applications\npending, and 21 patent applications pending in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We continually review our development\nefforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2024, we held 56 registered trademarks in the United States and\n194 registered trademarks in non-U.S. jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous\npending trademark applications in the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered\ndomain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and\ncost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the\nfuture or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “\nRisk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third\nparties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and reputation ” and “ Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperation s.”\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions.\nThese laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment,\ncommissions and fees, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality\nobligations, product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, membership services,\nintellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, advertising, taxation, privacy, data\nprotection, cybersecurity, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action\nwaiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and\nbackground checks.

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\nall or part of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nconsistently maintain or increase profitability in the future;\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to adequately\nmaintain their service levels or materially increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business\ncould be adversely affected;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or\nplatform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful;\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate, it could have an adverse effect that is material to our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations;\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result;\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (our \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n10\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval; and\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services, expanded\ninto new categories, changed our pricing methodologies, and entered new geographies. This limited operating history\nand our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may\nencounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\nsuccessfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nwith respect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline and food costs;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\nhire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations;\neffectively adapt to and manage the regulatory environment and new laws related to our business; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have relatively limited\nhistorical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of\noperations may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more\npredictable market. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations\ncould differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nconsistently maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nWhile we achieved net income in the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred net losses in each preceding year\nsince our founding. We incurred a net loss of $558 million and achieved net income of $123 million in 2023 and\n2024, respectively, and as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we had an accumulated deficit of $5.2 billion and $5.3\nbillion, respectively. We expect our costs will increase over time and we expect to invest significant additional\nfunds towards growing our business. To the extent that we are unable to earn sufficient revenue to offset such\ncosts, we may incur losses in certain future periods. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial\nfinancial and other resources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or\nacquiring new platform features and services, acquiring and integrating technologies and businesses, expanding into\nnew markets and categories, and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than\nwe expect and may not result in sufficient increased revenue or growth in our business to offset such costs. Any\nfailure to increase our revenue\n11\nTable of Contents\nsufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from consistently achieving,\nmaintaining, or increasing profitability on a consistent basis, which could also negatively impact our cash flow.\nIf we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2024, we had $1.6\nbillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards.\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nOur business has grown rapidly during various periods since our founding. Our past revenue growth rate, growth in\ndemand for our offerings, and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future\nperformance. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period\nas any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business metrics growth in future\nperiods.\nIn particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the\nshort term and decline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market\nadoption. We may also experience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform,\ninsufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing\ncompetition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, or\nincreasing regulatory costs. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our\nbusiness, which may not result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost of such investments. If our\nrevenue growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common\nstock could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, and\nother local incumbents. We also compete with merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online\nordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services,\nconvenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide merchant delivery services.\nIn addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and\npaper menus that merchants distribute to consumers. As we continue to expand to additional verticals, we may\ncompete or come in closer competition with additional businesses with substantial resources, users, and brand\npower, including large e-commerce companies, large retailers, large grocery store chains and other large delivery\nservice providers.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, market-specific knowledge, established relationships with local merchants and suppliers,\nlarger existing user bases, more successful marketing capabilities, established geographic footprints and\ninfrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. For example, with\ngrocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains that have strong bargaining power, established\nrelationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater financial resources and product development\ncapabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies\nand changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less attractive or obsolete.\nIf certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose\nto engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of merchant options or lack\naccess to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing to consumers. Our\ncompetitors have in the past, and may in the future, also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other\nstrategic relationships among themselves or with others, including by integrating their services or membership\nproducts with the offerings of another company that provides expanded distribution. Our competitors could also\nintroduce new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive\nmarketing campaigns than ours. Such efforts may lead us to lose consumers or access to new consumers or require us\nto increase our marketing or promotional expenses or otherwise increase investment in our service in order to\nmaintain our position with existing and new consumers.\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and may offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and\nconsumer fees, greater incentives for merchants joining their platforms and independent contractors who provide\ndelivery\n12\nTable of Contents\nservices, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, any of\nwhich may be more attractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures have led us, and may lead us in\nthe future, to change our commission rates and fees or change our incentives, discounts, and promotions to remain\ncompetitive. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will likely continue to negatively affect, our financial\nperformance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the markets in which we\ncompete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of\nour competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the other competitive\nadvantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees, or increase the\nincentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Local on-demand delivery\nservices for food and the other areas in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will\nstabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to maintain or increase profitability. Further, merchants\ncould determine that it is in their best interests to develop their own platforms to offer online pickup and\ndelivery rather than use our platform.\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift based on\ncost, quality, and selection and could use more than one local commerce platform; independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings; and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain\nof our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than\nours, which would make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate.\nAs a result of the reasons described above, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing\nmerchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers,\nor are forced to reduce our commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to cost-effectively grow our\nplatform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in new\nmarkets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers attracts\nmore merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has grown in\nthe past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our\nnational brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to incur\nsubstantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to\nacquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may\ninvest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for\nseveral years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will\nultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by\nproviding us at least 7 or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any exclusivity.\nIn the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection available on our\nlocal commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our relationships with some of\nour constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other constituencies. For example, the\nincreased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how compelling these offerings are to\nconsumers, depends in part on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership products. Additionally,\nmany of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and\nother reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such consumers, thereby\nencouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our membership products, through prompts\nand notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other offerings.\n13\nTable of Contents\nHowever, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our platform\nafter they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our consumers\nto regular paying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform, demand for our\nfull-price or paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or\ndecline.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the\nability to decline offers or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity\nprovisions with Dashers. Accordingly, if we do not continue to provide Dashers with accessibility to and\nflexibility on our platform and compelling opportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers, retain\nexisting Dashers, or increase their use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or\nwork stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. Relatedly, if merchants and/or consumers\nchoose to use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the\nperceived utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain\nDashers, we regularly invest in removing friction from the dashing process, offer monetary incentives and\nperquisites, including access to programs that provide cashback rewards on certain purchases, and provide\nopportunities to quickly access Dasher earnings. We also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing\nDashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase\nthe use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have unintended adverse consequences, including negative\npress, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our brand and reputation in both the\nUnited States and other geographies. Changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and\nemployment laws, or laws that require us to make changes to our platform that decrease the accessibility, including\nremoving access to our platform, or flexibility provided to Dashers in certain jurisdictions, may result in a\ndecrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of\nrecruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our control may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize\nour platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. If we fail to attract Dashers, retain existing Dashers on\nfavorable terms, or maintain or increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, we may not be able to meet\nthe demands of merchants and consumers and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to adequately\nmaintain their service levels or materially increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these\nmerchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods, meeting our requirements and\nstandards, or price their goods on our platform at unreasonable rates, our reputation and brand could be damaged.\nAn increase in merchant operating costs, whether due to inflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our\nplatform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect\nour revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. Further, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\n14\nTable of Contents\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nthe mix among various aspects of our business, including our Marketplaces and Commerce Platform, our U.S. and\nnon-U.S. operations, our restaurant and non-restaurant categories, and contributions to our overall business by new\nproducts and services, such as our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and our advertising products;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe impact of weather and seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college\ncampuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform, regulations governing the rates that we pay Dashers that\nutilize our platform and other conditions of their work, and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge\nto merchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of outbreaks of contagious disease and the response of governments and private industry;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, other natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become\nincreasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of\nour platform, especially during peak usage times, as our\n15\nTable of Contents\noperations grow and the usage of our platform increases. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not\nbe sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems\nfailures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions that\ninterrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These events have\nresulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of revenue and may\nharm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to consumers on our\nplatform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event, including for orders\nthat are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may voluntarily provide similar\ncredits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse from us for their losses and such\nclaims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, we may not be\nable to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged\ninterruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform\ncould adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets\nand arrangements that complement our business. We have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to\nevaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent markets and there is no assurance that such acquired\nbusinesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we enter into, will be successfully integrated into our\nbusiness, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits on a timely basis or at all.\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and\nnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and\nadversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\ndifficulties integrating the technologies and operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts,\nand personnel of an acquired business;\ndifficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business,\nand difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\ndifficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\nchallenges integrating internal controls, procedures, and policies and accounting, finance, and forecasting\npractices of acquired businesses with our own, especially in the context of international businesses;\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense\nsharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership\ninvestments;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndifficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones,\nlanguages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\ncurrency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with non-U.S. jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment\nopportunities;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an investment or acquired\nbusiness, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices,\nlitigation, security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand management, revenue recognition or other\naccounting practices, or employee or user issues;\n16\nTable of Contents\nthe enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our\nability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions\n(such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the\ncompletion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\nan acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our\nexisting business;\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction,\nwhich may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\nas a result of an acquisition, third parties we or an acquired business works with may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions, seek to terminate, change, or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired business,\nor consider working with a competitor instead; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our\nresults of operations, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or\nif the transaction costs are greater than expected.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. Strategic investments\ninherently involve less control over business operations of the investee, thereby potentially increasing the\nfinancial, legal, operational, regulatory, or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic\ninvestment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or\nentities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or\ncompetitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders,\nmanagement, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result\nin litigation or regulatory action against us, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to\nsell or transfer, or realize value from our investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and\nregulations. Entry into certain transactions with non-U.S. entities now or in the future may be subject to\ngovernment regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or non-U.S. government\nentities. If a transaction with a non-U.S. entity is subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might\nlimit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term\nbusiness strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments will generate returns for our\nbusiness, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, during the quarters\nended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, we recorded impairments of $312 million and $101 million,\nrespectively, associated with non-marketable equity securities that we acquired in connection with strategic\ninvestments.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets,\narrangements, and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such\nacquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful.\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S.\ncountries as part of our growth strategy. We currently operate in over 30 countries across the globe. Our\noperations outside of the United States require significant operating expenses and management attention in order to\noversee operations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural norms, and customs, in addition\nto placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Our\ninternational operations and our plans for investment in non-U.S. jurisdictions subject us to a number of risks and\nwe may not be successful in our international operations for a variety of reasons, including:\ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in non-U.S. countries and maintaining our\ncompany culture across all of our offices;\nan inability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers or an inability to reach agreements with and\nretain third party service providers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local area and culture, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\n17\nTable of Contents\ndiffering demand dynamics and difficulty accurately predicting consumer preferences and purchasing habits, which\nmay make our platform less successful;\ndifficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, consumers, and Dashers in non-U.S.\njurisdictions;\ndifficulty complying with varying laws and regulatory standards across jurisdictions, including with respect to\nlabor and employment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export control and sanctions, public health, payment\nprocessing, transactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\nincreased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue\nrecognition and similar accounting principles;\ndifficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and\ncustoms, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it\nrelates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax laws, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\nunique and varying terms and conditions and cultural norms in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\nvarying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\nforeign currency exchange restrictions or costs;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, which have occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations and differences in available instruments to invest our funds, including the risk profile associated\nwith such investments, and limitations on our ability to repatriate funds.\nChallenges with operating and growing our business internationally increase the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security\nrisks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards,\nincluding with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions, such as\nU.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, the\noperations of our wholly owned subsidiary, Wolt Enterprises Oy (\"Wolt\"), in jurisdictions that are in close\nproximity to Russia increase the difficulty in complying with trade and economic sanction regimes related to\nbusiness with Russia.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors, and we may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, some jurisdictions in which we operate\nhave introduced price control measures on local commerce platforms and established minimum earnings standards for\ncertain delivery workers, including Dashers, and we expect other such measures may be enacted in the future. These\nprice control measures, minimum earnings standards, and similar regulations have caused, and may in the future\ncause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers.\nCertain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings.\nSimilarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract and retain new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There is no assurance that we will not be forced, through\ncompetition, regulation, or otherwise, to\n18\nTable of Contents\nreduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform,\nfurther reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or increase our marketing and other expenses to\nattract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have launched, and\nmay in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, including Dasher or consumer loyalty programs,\nsuch as our membership products like DashPass and Wolt+, or modify existing pricing methodologies or the way in\nwhich fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers and which may result in lower commissions or fees, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our consumers’ price\nsensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our business model and pricing methodologies may not\nbe competitive in these locations. As a result, our continued international expansion may require us to change our\noperations and pricing strategies to adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing\nand gratuities.\nOur assessments about optimal pricing strategy may not be accurate and may not enable us to compete in the\ncategories and regions in which we operate effectively. There may also be errors or defects in the technology we\nuse to set our prices, which could result in underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, as the products\nand services on our platform change, we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Any such pricing assumptions,\ntechnological errors or defects in pricing, or changes to our pricing methodology could adversely affect demand for\nour platform, our brand and reputation, and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay models for Dashers.\nOur pay models for Dashers have previously led, and may continue to lead, to negative publicity, lawsuits,\narbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under a former pay model for Dashers in the United\nStates, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little or no tip.\nAlthough this additional pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile, it also\nhad the effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being received by\nDashers. Government authorities have brought claims against us related to a former Dasher pay model and government\nauthorities may bring similar claims in the future against our pay models.\nWe have also launched, and may in the future launch, changes to the rates and fee structures for Dashers that\nutilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers and may result in\nnegative publicity or damage to our reputation. Changes to our pay models have resulted in, and in the future may\nresult in, negative publicity related to perceptions of its complexity, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and\nlack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, any of which may negatively impact our ability to attract\nand retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, we increased the amount we paid to Dashers per order\nwhen we changed our pay model in September 2019, but this also caused less consistency in earnings across\ndeliveries in some cases. In addition, in June 2023, we announced an option for Dashers in most cities to earn a\nguaranteed hourly rate while delivering. We change our Dasher pay models from time to time based on a variety of\nfactors, including as a result of legal and regulatory changes and expansion into new categories and geographies.\nIn particular, new or amended laws and regulations have required, and could in the future require, us to make\nchanges to our Dasher pay models, or make other changes to our platform, that decrease the flexibility provided to\nDashers in certain jurisdictions, which may also impact our ability to cost-effectively attract or retain Dashers.\nOur current Dasher pay models, any changes made in response to new laws and regulations, and any future changes to\nour pay models or our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers, could result in an increase to the\nfees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain consumers, and could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform remain independent contractors, there is a risk\nthat Dashers may be reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law or the laws of other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. As discussed further elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have been involved in and\ncontinue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification in the United States. A\nreclassification of Dashers as employees could require us to revise our pricing methodologies and Dasher pay models\nto account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other internal adjustments to account for any\ntransition of a subset of Dashers to employment positions, which could have an adverse effect that is material to\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n19\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. This growth has\nplaced, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial\ninfrastructure.\nWe will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure, including the development of\nappropriate controls, in order to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nSimilarly, our failure to implement and maintain effective cybersecurity systems and measures with respect to our\nplatform as we grow could result in, among other things, breaches, security incidents, theft or fraud, service\ndisruptions, loss of user confidence in our platform, legal claims, regulatory investigations, and damage to our\nreputation or brand, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, services, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our\noperational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large\nnumber of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge\nour ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our\nplatform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand could hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform. Similarly, maintaining and\nenhancing the Wolt reputation and brand will be particularly important for our continued growth in Europe and Asia.\nSuccessfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network\neffects of our platform will depend on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent,\nhigh-quality services and support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use\nthe “DoorDash” and \"Wolt\" marks, our logos, and other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of\nother factors, many of which are outside our control. Our users have a wide variety of options for delivery of\ngoods, including other local commerce platforms and services, and consumer preferences may also change. To expand\nour user base, we must appeal to new users who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or\nother local commerce platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be adversely affected\nby complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize our platform or\nour competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. The effect of negative\npublicity could be exacerbated to the extent dissatisfaction with, or complaints concerning, us are disseminated\nvia social media platforms. Any such expressions of dissatisfaction or complaints, even if ultimately concluded to\nbe unfounded or successfully resolved without direct adverse financial effects, could still harm our brand,\nreputation, and local network effects. Negative perception of our platform or company may result from:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our business model, our platform, services or items provided through\nour platform, including highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines,\nincluding Dasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\ntraffic accidents caused by, or involving, Dashers or employee couriers or death or serious injury involving a\nDasher or employee courier or any party associated with us;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, in which constituencies of our network become infected;\n20\nTable of Contents\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient number of offers or otherwise pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or security\nbreaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact the\nreliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or operations;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, or inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements, including violations of food\ninformation and alcohol delivery age verification regulations;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of merchant, consumer, and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\nperception of any key brands, influencers, or other third parties that we have partnered with or may partner with\nin the future;\nour operations in regions that are or become subject to geopolitical instability, conflict, or economic\nsanctions, and any negative consequences of such operations to us, our merchants, consumers, or Dashers; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nFor example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which Dashers were\ncompensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general food safety\nand quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers, and merchants using our platform, which has\nadversely affected our reputation and brand from time to time. If we do not successfully develop, protect, and\nenhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network effects of our platform, our business may not grow,\nand we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, subject us\nto claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our reputation, brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, transmission, and other processing of personal data and other\nsensitive and proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and\nproprietary data relating to our business, including our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our\nemployees. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in severity and sophistication and can originate with external\nactors or with our employees and contractors, whether acting maliciously or by inadvertently providing access to an\nexternal party or having their credentials compromised by an external party. Further, due to the current\ngeopolitical environment, there is heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents sponsored by state actors or state-\naffiliated actors. In addition to other vectors, cybersecurity incidents can originate on our vendors’ systems,\nwhich can be leveraged to access our websites, platforms, and data, including personal data. We and our vendors\nhave previously experienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in August 2022, we reported\nan incident affecting one of our vendors that resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of certain consumers\nand Dashers. We have undertaken steps to enhance our cybersecurity and\n21\nTable of Contents\ngovernance program, which include adding security layers around data, improving access controls, hiring additional\npersonnel with cybersecurity experience, and using outside expertise to identify and repel threats. We cannot\nassure you that all potential causes of these incidents have been identified and remediated or will not lead to\nrecurrence or other incidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage or exfiltrate data from information systems\nchange frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable\nto anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate detective or preventive\nmeasures, and we and our vendors may face delays in our response to or remediation of breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems used in our\nbusiness through various means. In addition, there have been, and may in the future be additional, attempts to\nfraudulently induce our employees, merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names,\npasswords, payment card information, or other sensitive information resulting in user account takeovers or the\nfraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. With the prevalence of remote work, we may also be exposed to increased\nrisks of breaches or incidents via these or other methods.\nAlthough we have taken measures to monitor and protect our systems and the data in our possession, these measures\nhave not fully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. Our IT and\ninfrastructure may be vulnerable to viruses, phishing and other forms of social engineering, denial-of-service,\ncredential stuffing, ransomware and other malware, insecure third-party libraries, application or network\nvulnerabilities, reliance on third-party vendors for patches, unauthorized configurations, employee error and\nmalfeasance, and other sources of disruption or unauthorized access, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may be\nable to access our systems and data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data, through our\nsystems. Although we have policies and technical controls restricting the access to and sharing of the data we\nstore, as well as requiring encryption of data where appropriate, these policies and controls may not be effective\nin all cases. Any actual or perceived breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our reputation,\nbrand, and competitive position, result in our platform being unavailable, loss or improper access to, or\nunavailability of, data, fraudulent transfer of funds, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and significant\nlegal, regulatory, and financial exposure. Any such actual or perceived breaches or incidents or any perception\nthat our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence in, or\ndecreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived breaches or other incidents directed at, or\nsuffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence\nin us.\nAny actual or perceived breach or other security incident impacting any entities with which we share or disclose\ndata (including, for example, our vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security\nmeasures and respond to any incidents impacting them is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant\nsupply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not been breached or that they\ndo not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other\ndisruption to, our or our vendors’ systems.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance that may help provide\ncoverage for these types of incidents and resulting claims, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will\nbe adequate for liabilities incurred relating to any breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any\nfuture claim. The successful assertion of any claim against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or\nchanges in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-\ninsurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIf the on-demand local commerce category does not continue to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe on-demand local commerce category has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is uncertain\nto what extent the market for local commerce platforms will continue to grow. The markets for certain services we\nfacilitate, in particular convenience, grocery, advertising, and certain other categories, are in earlier stages of\ndevelopment than our restaurant category, and it is uncertain whether demand for these services will continue to\ngrow and achieve stable, widespread market acceptance. In addition, through our acquisition of Wolt, we have\nentered many geographies where the development of the on-demand local commerce category is in different stages of\nmarket acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt on-\ndemand local commerce platforms. If merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to on-demand local\ncommerce platforms as we expect, including\n22\nTable of Contents\nas a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on\nour platform or on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead adopt alternative solutions that may arise,\nthen the market for our platform may not further develop or may develop slower than we expect, either of which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to the long-term success of our business, including by expanding our platform and enhancing the\nconsumer experience, which may not maximize short-term financial results and may yield results that conflict with\nthe market’s expectations, which could result in our stock price being adversely affected.\nWe are committed to the long-term success of our business, including by expanding our platform and enhancing the\nconsumer experience, which we believe will ultimately drive long-term shareholder value. However, expanding our\nplatform and continually enhancing the consumer experience requires steady and significant investments, which may\nnot necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business decisions that may negatively\nimpact our short-term financial results when we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve\nthe consumer experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These decisions\nmay not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term\nbenefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third party\nservice providers, whether or not occurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely\naffect our business, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third party\nservice providers, including the activities of former consumers and Dashers or individuals who are impersonating\nconsumers, merchants, Dashers, or other third party service providers, have occurred, and in the future may occur,\nwhich could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities\ninclude food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, dangerous or unlawful\nvehicular operation, assault, battery, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts,\nregistering consumer, merchant, or Dasher accounts with us using stolen personal information or altered\nidentification documents, additional forms of identity theft, and other misconduct. Such activities have resulted\nin, and may in the future result in, physical injury, loss of life, property and financial damage for consumers,\nmerchants, Dashers, and other third parties, business disruption, reputational and brand damage, or other\nsignificant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card, debit card, or bank account information, fraud with respect to background checks,\nfraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, exploitation of system bugs or\nvulnerabilities to circumvent payment requirements, account takeovers of merchant, consumer, or Dasher accounts by\nbad actors, other unauthorized uses of another person's identity, and use of fraudulent identification documents.\nFor example, bad actors have created consumer, merchant, and Dasher accounts using stolen personal identifying\ninformation for illicit purposes. Among other things, this has caused Form 1099s in the United States, and the\nequivalent in other countries with similar reporting obligations, to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not\nperforming services as Dashers. In addition, under current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders\nfacilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved\nthe credit card transaction.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nillegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities of merchants, consumers, Dashers, and other third party\nservice providers, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all such activity from occurring or scale\nefficiently with our business and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through litigation or\nregulatory action, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to\nguard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all\nDashers undergo a background check where permitted by applicable law, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent\nDashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable to implement and\ncommunicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, or if our competitors\ndo not adopt similar measures, the growth of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform\ncould be adversely affected. Any negative publicity related to incidents involving illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activities, or the measures we adopt to mitigate the risk of such incidents, whether such incidents\noccurred on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or\npublic perception of our industry as a whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and\npotentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\n23\nTable of Contents\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which sometimes includes facilitating deliveries to\nconsumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less\noperationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner\nmerchants’ systems. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order and a higher\nlikelihood of errors. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with\nfacilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nSome non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. There is a\nrisk that non-partner merchants will bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. In\naddition, measures have been enacted in many U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit, among other things, on-demand local\ncommerce platforms like ours from facilitating deliveries from restaurants without the restaurants’ prior consent.\nWe have adopted internal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for\ndelivery on our platform in the United States and require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner\nrestaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with\nus. However, we may continue to add non-partner merchants in categories other than restaurants. We may also\ncontinue to revise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the\nextent we are required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this may adversely affect our\nability to provide a broad selection of merchants on our platform, attract and retain consumers and could directly\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, we do\nnot successfully manage our platform strategy, or we are not able to keep pace with technological developments, we\nmay not remain competitive and our business and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsites and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. To compete\neffectively, we must also provide a convenient, efficient, and reliable merchant and consumer experience on our\nplatform, and we may be unable to effectively address merchant and consumer needs or identify emerging consumer\ntrends.\nIn addition, any new products or services that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective\nmanner, may contain errors or defects, or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate\nsufficient revenue. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers may delay adoption and use of new products and services to\npermit them to make a more thorough evaluation of those products and services and to compare them against\npotentially competitive products in the market. Further, we may make changes to our platform and platform strategy\nthat merchants, consumers, or Dashers do not find useful and we may discontinue certain products, services, or\nfeatures that our merchants, consumers, or Dashers have otherwise enjoyed. To the extent that discontinued\nproducts, services, or features remain subject to a current contract with the applicable third party, we may incur\ncosts with respect to our determination to discontinue those products, services, or features. Failure to\neffectively manage our platform and platform strategy could lead to merchant, consumer, or Dasher dissatisfaction\nand contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If existing and new\nmerchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to be\nreliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform, we\nmay not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, if competitors introduce new features, offerings, or technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices or consumer trends emerge, our existing technology, services, websites, and mobile applications may\nbecome less popular or obsolete. For example, our competitors may develop and commercialize autonomous and drone\ndelivery technologies at scale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or\ndrone delivery to market before we do, or their technology is, or is perceived to be, superior to our or our\npartners’ technology, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success could depend in\nlarge part on our ability to invest in, develop, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry\nstandards and practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to, and new services on, our platform may involve significant technical risks, the time and\nattention of our\n24\nTable of Contents\npersonnel, including management and key employees, and upfront capital investments that may not generate return on\ninvestment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If\nwe face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features and services or if our recently introduced\nofferings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform may forgo the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses,\nincluding DashMart and Wolt Market. To build and expand our self-operated businesses, we have made substantial\ninvestments, including in establishing and managing a reliable supply chain for in-store products, establishing\nsupply-related contractual partnerships, leasing premises, hiring personnel, and rolling out relevant technologies\nand processes. We plan to continue to invest in such businesses in the future. The maintenance and expansion of our\nself-operated businesses requires significant investments, and there is no assurance that we will realize any of\nthe anticipated benefits. In locations where we operate DashMart and Wolt Market, we may not be able to generate a\nsufficient number of orders to cover our fixed costs and make such services viable and we may incur significant\ncosts before we can determine the viability of these DashMart and Wolt Market locations. Our self-operated retail\nlocations also expose us to different regulatory requirements and risks than our Marketplaces and Commerce\nPlatform, in particular with respect to food safety, permit and license requirements, and zoning restrictions, and\ncertain other business risks, including inventory shrinkage. Our expansion into convenience, grocery, and other\nretail categories, may also result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business opportunities as\nwell as the diversion of resources from support functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business, and attracting merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and we may not generate a meaningful return on these\ninitiatives. Even if we increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the\nadditional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not successful or\ncost-effective, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the gains in efficiency\nto our platform that we expect. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business and subject to a number\nof risks, including changes to our Dasher pay models and changes in macroeconomic conditions. The cost-\neffectiveness of our platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do\nnot reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are\nunable to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency,\nDasher pay, and defective orders, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party customer support\nproviders who are qualified to support users of our platform and well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our\n25\nTable of Contents\ninternational business and the number of users not based in the U.S. on our platform, our support organization will\nface additional challenges, including those associated with delivering support in languages other than English and\nin ways consistent with the customs and dominant technologies used in the various geographies in which we operate.\nAny failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support,\ncould harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability to scale our platform and business, our financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending habits and Dasher behavior patterns, each of which have a\nsignificant impact on our growth and expenses. We experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the\ncalendar year, although our rapid growth in historical periods has made, and may continue to make, seasonal\nfluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity may be impacted by weather. Colder or more\ninclement weather may increase consumer demand, while warmer or sunny weather may decrease consumer demand. In\ncontrast, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of cold or inclement weather when we need\nmore Dashers available to fulfill orders driven by increased consumer demand. In such instances, we typically rely\non incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs.\nFurther, severe weather can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, making it impossible to fulfill\ndeliveries. We also benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we\nexperience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation\nperiods, causing adverse effects to our business during impacted periods. Seasonality will likely cause\nfluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the\nexisting seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and contribute to greater fluctuations in\nour results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our\nresults of operations and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than\nexpected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges to economic conditions can impact consumer spending in the regions where we do business, which can prompt\nconsumers to reduce spending on our platform or forgo spending on our platform altogether. Any factor that impacts\nconsumer spending broadly may also impact consumer spending on our platform. Some of these factors include\nunemployment, inflation, consumer debt, fluctuations in transportation costs, increased food costs, declines in\nasset prices, mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, changes in interest rates and credit availability, and\nconsumer confidence in the current and future political and economic environment. Economic conditions in certain\nregions may also be affected or exacerbated by natural disasters and threats to public health. Additionally,\nvolatility in the global financial markets, or in specific segments of those markets, may contribute to banks and\nfinancial institutions with whom we have banking or payment processing relationships entering receivership or\nbecoming insolvent in the future, and we may be unable to access or may lose some or all of our existing cash and\ncash equivalents to the extent those funds are not insured or otherwise protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance\nCorporation or other insurance programs. Such volatility may also adversely impact any funds held temporarily at\nour third-party payment processors.\nIn addition, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages and supply chain issues at merchants could negatively\nimpact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplaces and in our\nCommerce Platform. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact\nconsumer demand and drive lower order volume on our Marketplaces and in our Commerce Platform. Small businesses\nthat do not have substantial resources, like many of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely\naffected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform, including our small\nbusiness merchants, cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business\ndisruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely\nto use our platform.\nAs our business has grown, we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse global economic and\npolitical conditions, including the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Both these conflicts have had, and\nmay continue to have, an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions in their respective regions and given rise to\nvolatility and instability in a manner that adversely affects our business and merchants, consumers, and Dashers on\nour platform in those regions.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our operations in non-U.S. countries. When\nconducting business in non-U.S. countries, including through Wolt and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nbusiness is typically denominated in the local currency of the respective country, which exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposure is currently to the Euro,\nthe Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel, and the Australian dollar. Additionally, because our financial statements\nare presented in U.S. dollars, local functional currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable\nexchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements, thereby increasing our foreign exchange translation risk.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity, which\nmay reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and\nequity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train,\nand integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\nan increasing share of our workforce working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and spending less time collaborating\nin offices;\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; and\n27\nTable of Contents\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\"). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to\nincrease our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-\nconsuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations. We also need to implement, integrate, and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting at companies we acquire, and any failure to do so could impact our ability to meet our\nfinancial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports\nregarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it\n28\nTable of Contents\ndoes not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an excessive number of users\naccessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return to our platform as often\nin the future, or at all. This could adversely affect our ability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ndecrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity\nconstraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and network architecture to\naccommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in\nreputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions into our platform, offerings, services, and features,\nor in support of internal business operations, and these applications may become important in our operations over\ntime. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more\nsuccessfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of\noperations. Additionally, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are\nor are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, inappropriate, or biased, or if the use of AI results in, or is alleged\nto have resulted in, the infringement of the intellectual property of third parties or violations of other rights\nof third parties, we may be subject to legal claims or liability and our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations may be adversely affected. The use of AI applications may result in data leakage or unauthorized\nexposure of data, including confidential business information, the personal data of end users, or other sensitive\ninformation. Such leakage or unauthorized exposure of data related to the use of AI applications could result in\nlegal claims or liability or otherwise adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. AI also presents\nemerging ethical and regulatory issues and if our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or\nreputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. The rapid evolution of AI, including the development of\ngovernment regulation of AI and automated decision-making technology more generally, may require significant\nresources to develop, test, and maintain our platform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI\nand automated decision-making technology more generally in a manner that complies with applicable laws and\nregulations and ethically in order to minimize unintended, harmful impact.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and has contained in the past, and may contain in the\nfuture, undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been\nreleased. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of software updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The\nthird-party software that we incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any\nerrors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from third-party software after release could result in\nnegative publicity and a loss of users, revenue, and availability of our platform, as well as other performance\nissues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on\nour platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We may need to expend\nsignificant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or\nto address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects,\nor vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result\nin dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” with respect to RSUs we issue to employees and service providers, pursuant to\nwhich shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of\nthe RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales\nare remitted by us to the taxing authorities. Some holders may instead elect to pay cash directly to us to cover\nsuch withholding obligations, but in a significant majority of cases, shares are sold on behalf of each holder upon\nthe vesting and settlement of the RSUs. While such sales do not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us\nto satisfy the tax withholding obligations for RSUs, such sales cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the\nextent a large number of shares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our\nstock price to fluctuate.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts, key business and non-\nGAAP metrics, such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, and certain other metrics required by\nregulatory and administrative bodies, such as the monthly active recipients of our services in the EU (as required\nby Article 24(2) of the Digital Services Act), with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified\nby any third party and those operational metrics may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third\nparties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and\ntools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which\ncould result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. In addition, while\nwe track these metrics during the quarter, system limitations and the auditing process may result in the metrics\nthat we publicly disclose differing materially from the estimated amounts that were tracked during that same\nperiod. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or\ncontain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are\nbased on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there\nare inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy\nof our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there\nare consumers who have multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our terms of service and we implement\nmeasures to detect and prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the\nnumber of consumers on our platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with\nrespect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could\naffect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if\ninvestors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with\nrespect to these figures, investors may lose confidence in our operating metrics and business and we expect that we\ncould be subject to legal claims, including securities class action lawsuits, and our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany loss adjustment expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and\ninsurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive modeling\nand actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial\nprojections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently\nrepresented in the historical data or which are not yet quantifiable. A number of external factors can affect the\nactual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open,\nfluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected\nevents such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such factors can impact the\nreserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves\nfor claims incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expenses for current and historical periods. For\nany of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our financial statements. If we determine that our estimated\ninsurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination,\nwhich could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively\nimpact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, it could have an adverse effect that is material to our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in non-U.S.\njurisdictions, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. Laws\nand regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors vary by jurisdiction and are\nsubject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and\nunpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and consumers that use our platform. For example, in\nJanuary 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor released a final rule regarding the classification of employees and\nindependent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which implements new interpretative guidance\nfor classification of workers.\nWhile we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors,\nDashers may be reclassified as employees due to changes in the law or its interpretation. Depending on the\njurisdiction and the extent of our operations in each such jurisdiction, a reclassification of Dashers as employees\ncould have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition, and results of operations,\nincluding as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to PAGA and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly\nalter our existing business model and operations in order to continue to operate our platform in that jurisdiction,\nwhich would result in significant increased costs and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain\nDashers on our platform, which could have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. A reclassification of Dashers as employees could also result in an increase to the fees\nwe charge to consumers and the commissions we charge to merchants, which in turn could affect our ability to\nattract and retain consumers and merchant partners, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought,\nfor example, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees.\nSeveral jurisdictions, including in the United States, have modified, or are considering modifying, their standards\nused to determine worker classification. For example, in July 2024, the Supreme Court of California ruled\nunanimously to uphold the core of Proposition 22, which preserves flexibility for California Dashers. Jurisdictions\nthat have passed or may pass laws protecting Dashers’ independent contractor status may impose new obligations that\nincrease our costs. For example, certain provisions of Proposition 22 regarding compensation, along with certain\nother requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California. These provisions have increased our costs\nrelated to Dashers in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, in certain circumstances we charge\nhigher fees and commissions, which have resulted in, and in the future could result in, lower order volumes over\ntime. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs could\nalso lead to a lower Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share.\n31\nTable of Contents\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate have adopted or may be considering, or in the future may consider,\nadopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or\nvoluntary agreements with third parties, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections\nand benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation,\nballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or agreements, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in\nsuch jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if it becomes\nnecessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely affect our results\nof operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation\ncould still be challenged and subject to litigation.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. For example, on November 1, 2021, the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued a\ndecision which deemed that Wolt courier partners in Finland are in an employment relationship with Wolt, and that\nWolt should be mandated to keep statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. Although we appealed the\ndecision and, in February 2024, the Administrative Court of Hämeenlinna issued a decision concluding that Wolt\ncourier partners are not in an employment relationship with Wolt, this decision is subject to further appeal and we\nmay be subject to similar actions in other jurisdictions. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing\nthe standards used to determine worker classification, which may impact the classification of Dashers using our\nplatform. For example, the EU's Platform Work Directive, which entered into force in December 2024, requires EU\nmember states to transpose its requirements to their national laws, including enacting new national laws for\ndetermining worker classification of platform workers, and may involve differing implementation by the various\nmember states. Such EU-wide legislative reforms may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent\ncontractor model within the European Economic Area (the \"EEA\").\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, or for\nother reasons, we may decide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does, for example, in Germany, which\ncould result in certain operational challenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain\njurisdictions or decide not to expand our business in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth\nand expansion opportunities.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result.\nWe face potential liability, legal expenses, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business\ngenerally, and with the delivery services we facilitate in particular. Specifically, we are subject to claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands, and other legal, regulatory, and\nother administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker\nclassification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints,\nintellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits,\ngovernment investigations, and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to threatened and\nactual legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could\ndo so in the future as well. If any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that\ngenerate a significant percentage of our overall business, it could cause considerable harm to our business.\nFurther, food and other products that are ordered through our platform could be subject to a recall, but we may\nhave limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses,\nfood and other product recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or\ndelivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, or any related injuries to, or\ndeaths of, any consumers or Dashers, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery\nindustry, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to Dasher\nearnings, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including our\nbackground check processes, removal of platform access, and the nature and frequency of our communications to\nDashers via email, text, or telephone. We also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class\nactions, by or relating to consumers regarding,\n32\nTable of Contents\namong other things, disclosures we make with respect to sales tax, consumer fees, gratuities, sign up and\ncancellation of subscription services, the local delivery fulfillment services we facilitate, discrepancies between\nthe items on our websites and consumer applications and the items advertised at the merchants from which such items\nare delivered, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or\ntelephone. In addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other\nrepresentative actions, by or relating to merchants regarding, among other things, menu pricing, exclusivity\narrangements, and the listing of merchants on our platform without an agreement. Finally, we face potential\nliability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our websites and mobile\napplications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and negligence, among\nothers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands,\nor other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us,\nwhether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation,\nrequire significant management attention, and divert significant resources. It is possible that a resolution of one\nor more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining reserves for our pending\nlitigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation.\nThere is no guarantee that our litigation reserves will be sufficient to offset such liabilities. These proceedings\ncould also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders\nrequiring a change in our business practices. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other\nlegal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and\ncurrent and former directors and officers. Any of these outcomes and obligations could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, we include arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform.\nThese provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some\ncases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in court. However, arbitration can be costly and\nburdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our\nreputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize\nthese risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or\nbe required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which\ncould also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between U.S. state and federal law, there is a risk that some\nor all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or\nin part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have exposure to taxing authorities successfully asserting that we have not properly collected or remitted, or\nin the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, similar taxes or withholding\ntaxes, and successfully imposing additional obligations or liabilities on us, and any such assessments,\nobligations, or liabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain and could exceed the amount of any applicable reserves, if any. In addition\nto our own potential liability, if we or merchants pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to\nconsumers, our order volume may decline.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and gross receipt\ntaxes, in the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we operate. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and\nremit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our\ncalculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do\nnot currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, including tax on the cost of goods sold, and could\nimpose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect\ntaxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so, to\n33\nTable of Contents\ncollect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, or to collect, remit or pay taxes\nthat are otherwise the responsibility of our vendors and partners, could result in substantial tax liabilities,\nincluding taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and\nDashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may\nfail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes.\nThe United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in substantial financial liability and other consequences to us if we were\nunable to remedy such failures in a timely manner.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which could result in legislative\naction to increase indirect taxes, including digital services taxes. Such legislative action could discourage\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our provision for (benefit\nfrom) income taxes is a function of the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations\nor laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. The determination of our worldwide\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management\nand, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the applicable\nlaw and the ultimate tax determination are uncertain. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from)\nincome taxes is reasonable, the ultimate outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand could materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business operations,\nacquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes in our stock price, intercompany\ntransactions, changes in law or administrative interpretations thereof, changes in accounting principles, changes\nto our forecasts of income and loss, changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\nLegislative changes or administrative practices may increase our tax obligations and exposures and could adversely\naffect our business results and operations.\nThe U.S. federal, state, and local governments, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, such as\nthe European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes\nto existing tax laws and regimes that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do\nbusiness. In addition, regulatory and other guidance, including case law, with respect to existing tax laws are\nconstantly evolving. If one or more of these jurisdictions change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge our\ninterpretations of existing or new tax laws or their application, including how or where our profits and losses are\ncurrently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations may be adversely impacted. For example, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have\nadopted laws, administrative practices or interpretations that impose new tax measures, including but not limited\nto, revenue-based taxes and additional reporting obligations, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of\ngoods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other\ntaxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third-party\nobligations.\nJurisdictions have also proposed or enacted taxes on gross revenue derived from, for example, sales of online\nadvertising services and the provision of digital intermediary services such as the operation of online\nmarketplaces. Proliferation of these or similar tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform\nis implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on\nus prospectively or retroactively, or\n34\nTable of Contents\nadditional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to\nprovide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various\ngovernment agencies. In some cases, we also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt\nprocesses to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by the effective date.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes is subject to limitations.\nWhile federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to\nexpiration, the deductibility of such NOL carryforwards is limited to 80% of our federal taxable income. Our state\nand non-U.S. NOLs have varying expiration dates going forward. Utilization of our NOL carryforwards depends on our\nfuture taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing NOL carryforwards and tax credits in various\njurisdictions could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable\nincome. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), loss\nutilization is limited if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50\npercentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders\nover a three-year period. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership\nchanges in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a\nresult, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable\nincome or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased\nfuture tax liability to us.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, Dasher deactivations, insurance, merchant pricing and\ncommissions, consumer fees, and taxes. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as worker\nclassification or our relationship with Dashers more generally (for example, those concerning Dasher pay and\ninsurance requirements), labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other\nhighly regulated products, online payments, gratuities, merchant pricing and commissions, text messaging,\nmembership products, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data protection, data transfers and sharing,\ncybersecurity, consumer protection, consumer fees, antitrust, background checks, website and mobile application\naccessibility, environmental sustainability and related disclosures, and tax and other government-imposed fees are\noften complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of\nspecificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain\nand may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations between U.S. law and the laws of other\ncountries, between U.S. state and federal law, between individual states, and even at the city and municipality\nlevel. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as\nnew guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies. For example, the scope and\ninterpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving\nand developing and, in particular, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act restricts telemarketing and the use of\nautomated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil\nclaims against us.\nWe are subject to regulatory review, proceedings, and audits pursuant to national, federal, state, and local laws\nregulating the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products. These regulations and\nlaws may dictate matters such as licensing, permitting, or other governmental review requirements, advertising\nrestrictions, and consumer age verification. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our operations\nresulting from the enforcement of these existing regulations, any changes to existing regulations or changes to the\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, or the adoption of any new legislation or regulations could\nresult in penalties or cause us to have to suspend sales and delivery of highly regulated products in a\njurisdiction for a period of time or result in increased sales or marketing costs, or changes to our business\npractices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nAs our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, we have become\nsubject to a growing array of laws and regulations, which increase the complexity and compliance risk inherent in\nour business. For example, the EU has recently enacted, and is in the process of enacting, various laws and\nregulations that govern digital services and AI, and impose environmental sustainability obligations and disclosure\nrequirements on businesses like ours. The impact of these new regulations on the overall industry, business models,\nand our operations is\n35\nTable of Contents\nuncertain. We may be required to enhance our disclosures and undertake certain changes to our products, services,\nfees and commissions structure, and operations, including hiring additional highly specialized personnel, as a\nresult of these new requirements, which could subject us to increased administrative costs.\nIn recent years, regulatory scrutiny of larger companies, technology companies, and companies engaged in dealings\nwith independent contractors has increased. As a result, regulatory and administrative bodies may enact new laws or\npromulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and\nregulations differently than they have in the past in a manner adverse to our business, including by changing\nemployment-related laws, mandating specific earnings standards or other requirements for Dashers, requiring\nbusinesses like ours to maintain specific auto insurance coverage, or by regulating or capping the commissions\nbusinesses like ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in December\n2023, a New York City rule mandating certain minimum earnings standards for certain food delivery workers took\neffect. In addition, some jurisdictions in which we operate have price control measures in effect on local commerce\nplatforms. These price control measures, minimum earnings standards, and similar regulations can increase the cost\nand complexity of operating, which has caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to\nconsumers. To the extent that price control measures, minimum earnings standards, or similar regulations lead to an\nincrease in the fees we charge to consumers, consumer demand for our services could be reduced, which would further\nharm our business and results of operations. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge or seek to regulate\nthe way in which we categorize, disclose, or collect consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of\nChicago has challenged such fees as confusing or misleading to consumers.\nIn addition, there is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment regarding antitrust and\ncompetition matters in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We could be subject to claims\nof violations of competition laws in many aspects of our business, including alleged market sharing, price fixing,\nanticompetitive exclusionary conduct, exchange of competitively sensitive information, and with respect to any\nacquisitions we undertake. For example, competition authorities in some of the jurisdictions in which Wolt operates\nhave made queries regarding, or investigated, Wolt’s pricing-related terms or other practices and competition\nauthorities and courts have issued decisions concerning Wolt’s pricing-related terms or other practices. Any\npotential violations of competition laws could result in litigation, fines, restrictions on our operations, render\napplicable provisions or contracts unenforceable, divert management’s attention, and lead to claims for damages and\nreputational harm, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nAny failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and\nregulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a\nresult of lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth\nof our business. Any costs incurred to prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and\nregulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad, including EU anti-money laundering directives and related regulations in connection with our\noperations in Europe. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and\nour employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. These laws may also hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. In addition, we may be subject to liability, including penalties and fines, for any failure to\nsatisfy certain requirements under anti-money laundering laws, such as meeting local “know your customer” and\nongoing due diligence standards. For example, in connection with our operations in Europe, we could be liable for\npenalties of up to 10% of our revenue in a fiscal year in the event that our anti-money laundering compliance\nmeasures are found to be insufficient. All of these laws may also require that we keep accurate books and records\nand maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have\npolicies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents\nwill not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held\nresponsible, and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands, including\nas a result of our acquisition of Wolt, and\n36\nTable of Contents\nas we increase sales and operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-\nbribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media\ncoverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil\nsanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s\nattention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various regulations relating to payment processing.\nThe majority of payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment\nservices, which subjects us to certain payment-related regulations. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. In the United States, money transmitters are\nregulated by numerous state and local governments and agencies, many of which may define \"money transmitter\"\ndifferently. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulations and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties levied by national, federal, state,\nor local regulators in one or more jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services. For example, as a result of our\noperations in Europe, we are subject to the revised EU Payment Services Directive (\"PSD II\") and related\nregulations. One of our subsidiaries acts as an intra-group licensed payment service provider and electronic money\ninstitution for its payment services to merchants in the EEA countries and has obtained a payment institution\nlicense and electronic money license from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with PSD II.\nShould our payment institution or electronic money licenses be revoked in the future, or any other enforcement\nmeasures be taken by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority, such as imposing penalties or forcing us to cease\noffering certain payment facilities, our operations in Europe would be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we\nexpand into new jurisdictions and expand or pursue new business opportunities, the payment-related regulations that\nwe are subject to will expand as well, including, for example, with respect to the provision of payments and\nfinancial services we offer in Israel. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules\nand regulations related to payment processing could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of\nsignificant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make significant changes to our\nbusiness practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny, which could interrupt our ability to\noperate in certain jurisdictions and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\nInternet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or\nchanges thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and\nincrease the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance\ncosts or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation,\ntariffs, user privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution,\nsocial media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications,\nconsumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is\nnot always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel,\nand personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally,\nit is possible that non-U.S. government entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or\nwebsites or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and websites. Any failure, or perceived\nfailure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand,\na loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, process, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that use our platform, as well as other personal data relating to our employees and other personnel. We are\nsubject to a growing body of local, municipal, state, federal, national, and international laws and regulations in\nthe jurisdictions where we operate that address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and\nprotection of certain types of data, which may require the notification of certain security breaches involving\npersonal data. These laws and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change through new\nlegislation, amendments to\n37\nTable of Contents\nexisting legislation, or changes in enforcement, and such changes may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to\nanother. For example, many U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy legislation similar to the California\nConsumer Privacy Act and a growing number of U.S. states have enacted legislation addressing other privacy matters,\nsuch as cybersecurity and consumer health data and biometrics. With our operations in the EU, we are subject to the\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation, as well as national data protection and privacy schemes in other countries in\nwhich we operate. Any changes in these laws or regulations or their interpretation or enforcement could add further\ncomplexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and legal risk; require additional investment of resources in\ncompliance and data management programs; and result in changes or increased compliance costs in business practices\nand policies. For example, new and evolving requirements around consumer health data may restrict our ability to\nprovide personalized content on our platform. These laws also impose strict and sometimes inconsistent requirements\nrelating to the processing of personal data as well as significant penalties, such as fines, injunctions against\nthe processing of personal data, and civil litigation claims, for noncompliance. We have incurred, and expect to\ncontinue to incur, significant expenses in our efforts to comply with current and evolving privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or\ncontractual obligations.\nWe are also subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures designed to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be\ncontractually required to process and secure data in certain manners and to indemnify and hold harmless third\nparties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations\nrelating to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, or consumer protection.\nAdditionally, our success depends in part on our ability to access, collect, use, and otherwise process data\nrelating to Dashers, merchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as\n“cookies,” is further restricted, regulated, or blocked by new laws, regulations, litigation, or other practices,\nthe amount or accuracy of Internet user information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted or are considering\nenacting legislation or regulations that significantly restrict the practice of online tracking. Other regulators\nare increasingly scrutinizing the use of online tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the\nonline behavioral advertising ecosystem. Moreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers, such as\nApple and Google, plan to or have implemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block tracking\ntechnologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted,\nsignificantly reduce the effectiveness of such practices and technologies. As a result, we may have to develop\nalternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently market\nto them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law and regulations or our practices\nand platform could be inconsistent with, be alleged to fail, or fail to meet all requirements of, such laws,\nregulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors, merchants, or Dashers on our platform, to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations or any other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, or cybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or\nrelease of personal data or other data relating to merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other individuals, or the\nperception of privacy concerns or that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could\ndamage our reputation and brand, discourage new and existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers from using our\nplatform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and\nlitigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance\nproviders are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-\nrelated risks including auto liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, security and data breaches,\ncrime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business\nliabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire\ninsurance. We may also choose to self-insure for certain types of claims or for certain claims below or above\ncertain dollar amounts. Even if we do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks, we may not obtain enough\ninsurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or\ndeductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our\n38\nTable of Contents\ninsurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. In\naddition, if any of our insurance providers terminate their relationship with us or refuse to renew their\nrelationships with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate insurance providers\nand may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, some of\nour agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain\nand maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of these merchant agreements and could be\nsubject to additional liabilities as a result.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-\ninsured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. In addition, if we were to experience an\nunusually large amount of operations-related claims that we self-insure, our financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Even if operations-related claims do not result in liability, we may incur\nsignificant costs in investigating and defending against them.\nInsurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a\nresult, our insurance and claims expenses could increase substantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles\nor self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims\nsignificantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience claims in excess of our\ncoverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a\nsignificant claim or claims for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles\nor self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third parties and other related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily Stripe and\nPayPal. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our\nrelationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to\nrenew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment\nprocessors and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame.\nFurther, the software and services provided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations,\nmay contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could\ncause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information,\nor make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of\ntime, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and\nadversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nWe also provide Dashers in the U.S. with access to certain banking services that facilitate, among other things,\nimmediate access to their earnings. Through this offering we act as a service provider to a bank and are\ncontractually bound to adhere to certain banking or financial regulations that could subject us to regulatory\nreview, proceedings, or audits pursuant to federal or state laws, as well as the risk of contractual breach and\nindemnification.\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, banking, anti-money\nlaundering, and similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors or the\nservices that we offer to our Dashers, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and\nproceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept\nonline payments or other payment card transactions or provide certain services to our Dashers, which could make our\nplatform less convenient and attractive to consumers and Dashers. We also rely on data provided by our payment\nservice provider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in\nsuch data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected. Additionally, these relationships require us to comply with payment card network operating\nrules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks, and certain other banking or financial\nregulations. These networks and other applicable authorities could adopt new rules or regulations or interpret or\nre-interpret existing rules or regulations in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some\nusers or Dashers, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or\nregulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, or lose our ability to offer access to\ncertain services that benefit Dashers, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely\n39\nTable of Contents\naffected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and\nfines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers, and if such providers fail to\nprovide accurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on accredited third-party background check providers to assist with\nverifying the authenticity of Dashers and to provide the criminal and/or driving history of potential Dashers and,\nin some cases, existing Dashers, to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to\napplicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such providers\ndo not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable law or regulations.\nIf any of our third-party background check providers fails to perform as expected, terminates its relationship with\nus or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find alternate\nproviders, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. In\ncertain jurisdictions, including Canada and the United States, we currently rely on a single third-party background\ncheck provider. In other jurisdictions, we rely on a very limited number of background check providers. If the need\narises, and we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not\nbe able to timely onboard potential Dashers and, as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential\nDashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background\nchecks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our\nexpectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform and, as a result, we may be\nunable to adequately help protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers. Conversely,\ninaccurate background checks may inadvertently exclude qualified Dashers from our platform. As a result of\ninaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-\nparty background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may\ncontinue to have access to, and complete deliveries through, our platform.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face regulatory or legal action, including class, collective, or other\nrepresentative actions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including investigations, lawsuits,\ninquiries, and demand letters, related to our background check review process and the notice requirements around\nbackground checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in certain jurisdictions\nbased on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks\nadequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where there are no industry-specific regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks, in\naccordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we choose background checks that are less thorough in scope\nthan we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or regulation, or if we fail to run additional background\nchecks after Dashers are onboarded, we may face negative publicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other security incidents, or our actual or\nperceived failure to take action on negative results of a background or other check that we may initiate with\nrespect to a Dasher, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased\nregulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform, services, and operations depend on a wide variety of third-party software and services and any\ninterruption in services provided by these third parties could adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nWe have integrations with or otherwise utilize or rely on PayPal, Stripe, Olo, Google Maps, Amazon Web Services\n(\"AWS\"), and a variety of other third-party vendors. Our business would be disrupted, and we may have to seek\nalternative service providers, if any of the third-party software or services we utilize, or functional equivalents\nthereof, were unavailable due to, among other reasons, extended outages or interruptions or because they are no\nlonger available on commercially reasonable terms or prices. Third-party software, applications, products,\nplatforms, and services, and the\n40\nTable of Contents\nterms on which they are offered, are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform\nto ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings. Updates to third-party software that integrates with our\nofferings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as it previously had or at all. In addition, some\nof our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform\nwith their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to operate and distribute\nour platform. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of our platform or give preferential\ntreatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our platform.\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by AWS, a third-party provider\nof cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We have experienced, and expect that in the\nfuture we will continue to experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability due to a\nvariety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors or misconduct, natural disasters,\ncybersecurity events, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. Although it would be difficult for a\nnumber of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud infrastructure providers on\ncommercially reasonable terms if it became necessary. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated, not\navailable on the same terms, or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience\nsignificant costs or downtime, which could adversely affect our business.\nIn certain markets, we regularly engage fleet companies to fulfill deliveries on our platform. Fleet companies are\nthird parties that provide delivery services using their own workforce or, in some cases, their own subcontractors.\nOur operations in some markets may be heavily dependent on the services of fleet companies. To the extent that we\ndo become reliant on fleet companies in certain markets, it may be difficult to find a suitable replacement for the\nfulfillment services that such fleet companies provide in a timely manner or at all. In addition, if fleet\ncompanies operate below appropriate quality standards or have compliance or other regulatory issues, our business,\nreputation and results of operations could be adversely affected in those markets. Although we contractually\nrequire our fleet partners to comply with applicable law in their operations, we do not control these companies and\nany non-compliance with applicable law has resulted in, and may in the future result in, increased legal and\nregulatory exposure and increased resourcing needs. In the event that our relationship with any of our key\npartners, including fleet companies, deteriorates, whether as a result of business disputes, regulatory issues, or\ndegrading quality of services, we may experience difficulties maintaining our operations in impacted markets, which\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within\nsuch application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that\nreduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could\ndecline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If\nsuch mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications\navailable to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications,\ngive preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose\nterms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us,\nor if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than\nthe placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms\nwill continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these\ndevices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed\nto work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful\nin developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’\nexperience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or\nusing our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating\nsystems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, in 2021, Apple imposed\nrequirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and implemented an application tracking\ntransparency framework that requires\n41\nTable of Contents\nopt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google announced it planned to adopt restrictions\nto restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes have, and we expect that these changes will\ncontinue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions. If we are unable to mitigate\nthe effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates\nfrom existing consumers on our platform.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear\nprominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through Internet search results on search engines\nlike Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to how and\nwhere our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its\nranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not\nbe prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of\nconsumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality, obtain and\nuse information that we consider proprietary, or use branding that is confusingly similar to our own. In addition,\nunauthorized parties may also attempt, or successfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential\ninformation, and trade secrets through various methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other\nmethods of protecting this data may be inadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may\ncontinue to adopt and use service names and domain names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build\nbrand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or\ntrademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks or domain\nnames. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not\ntimely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property.\nOur efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\n42\nTable of Contents\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under open source licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source\nlicenses to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software license.\nThis could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately\ncould result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected portions of our source\ncode, we could be required to purchase additional licenses and expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer\nsome or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software until we can adequately\naddress the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or non-U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nThere have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of\nwhat we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the\nterms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be\nrequired to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on terms that are not\neconomically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-\nengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our\nproprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure,\nacquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic conditions. We believe\nour working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months\nand beyond. We may seek\n43\nTable of Contents\nadditional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, or investments and our\nongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or\nconvertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we\nissue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We\nmay evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among\nother things, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance and the condition of the\ncapital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable\nto us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we\nrequire it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be\nimpaired, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole, pay\ndividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments and loans, or engage in transactions with\naffiliates. We are also required to comply with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined\nin accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our\ncurrent and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital\nneeds. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our\nbusiness strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies which are not subject to such\nrestrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility, to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, and to require cash collateral for\nany outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated or such cash collateral were to be required, we may not have sufficient cash\nor be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which\ncould immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even\nif we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are\nacceptable to us. As of December 31, 2024, there were no revolving loans outstanding and $112 million in aggregate\nface amount of letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2024, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of LaunchPad, and a member\nof our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of our board of\ndirectors collectively held 51% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate, which voting\npower may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards (including those\nequity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to our initial public offering and subject to equity exchange right\nagreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any shares\nof Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or the\nvesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of\nClass B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had\nbeen exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31, 2024, our Co-Founders\nwould collectively hold 61% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-Founders have also entered\ninto the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and\nvote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and\npermitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will\nbe able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including\nthe election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to\n44\nTable of Contents\nour certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from\nyours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated\ncontrol may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive\nour stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company,\nand might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting\npower and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders,\nwhich may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or\nour Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, which we\nsometimes refer to herein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total\ndisability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as\ndirected by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person,\nthen our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and\nno more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61\ndays and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an\nofficer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result\nof Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our\nstockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which\nsuch final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date.\"\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of\nour total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the\noutcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would\nhave no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting\ndilution, which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common\nstock to Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares\nof Class C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has\nbeen met. As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s\ncontrol of our voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most\nmatters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our\nCo-Founders and, in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve\nliquidity in their holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C\ncommon stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of\nNasdaq.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of Nasdaq, we\nexpect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain\nreduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2024, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of Nasdaq. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of the voting power for\nthe election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may\nelect not to comply with certain\n45\nTable of Contents\nlisting standards of Nasdaq regarding corporate governance, including requirements that a majority of its board of\ndirectors consist of independent directors, a compensation committee be composed of independent directors, and that\nthere is independent director oversight over the director nomination process.\nSuch corporate governance requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the\n“controlled company” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely\non these exemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing\nstandards of Nasdaq. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq, which could adversely affect the protections for other\nstockholders.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these\nestimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\n46\nTable of Contents\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously registered shares for future issuance\nunder our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the\nshares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be\navailable for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to\nrepurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock\nprice.\nIn February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount of up to $1.1 billion. Under existing or any future share repurchase\nprograms, we may make share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share market purchases, block\ntransactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our\nshare repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares,\nand may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases,\nif any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal\nrequirements, such as Delaware surplus and solvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any\nfailure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and\ninvestor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would\nbe and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance\nlong-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common\nstock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could\nreduce the effectiveness of our repurchase programs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases\nin the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we\ngrant to our employees.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements,\nand we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n47\nTable of Contents\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and\nrestated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state\nor federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n48\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our\nmarket, or if they change their analysis regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading\nvolume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their analysis regarding our Class A common stock adversely, publish more favorable analyses about\nour competitors than us, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our\nsecurities would likely decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate declaring or paying\nany dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.",

We have an\nenterprise-wide cybersecurity program that is designed to identify, protect, detect, and respond to reasonably\nforeseeable cybersecurity risk and threats, and continuously work to enhance and improve our cybersecurity and risk\nmanagement efforts.We routinely assess material risks from cybersecurity threats and maintain incident response\nplans designed to protect, identify, evaluate, respond to, and recover from a cybersecurity incident. The plans are\ndesigned to be flexible so that they may be adapted to an array of potential scenarios, and provide for the\ncreation of cross-functional cybersecurity incident response teams in the event of a cybersecurity incident. We\nregularly conduct exercises to help ensure our overall preparedness for a cybersecurity incident.\nWe also have invested in tools and technologies to protect our data and information technology, and we monitor our\nsystems on an ongoing basis to identify and assess risk. In addition, we have mandatory cybersecurity training\ndesigned to educate and train employees on how to identify and report cybersecurity threats. We also provide\nspecialized training for employees in more sensitive roles.\nWe take measures to assess and, where warranted, update and improve our cybersecurity program, including by\nregularly conducting internal risk assessments, internal control validations, independent program assessments,\nthreat assessments, penetration testing, and scanning of our systems for vulnerabilities. Our cybersecurity risk\nmanagement framework is based on applicable laws and regulations, as well as industry recognized standards and\npractices, including a system and organization controls 2 (SOC 2 type II) examination for certain DoorDash\nOperations (as defined below), an ISO 27001 certification for certain Wolt Operations (as defined below), and an\nannual payment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment card\ninformation. We undergo periodic third-party assessments against recognized industry standards and practices,\nincluding an annual payment card industry data security standard review of our security controls protecting payment\ncard information. We also periodically engage third-party advisors to assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity\nprogram, policies and practices, consult with external advisors regarding opportunities and enhancements to\nstrengthen our policies and practices, and assess our cybersecurity capabilities using third-party security firms.\nOur internal audit team provides independent assessment of our cybersecurity program and controls.\nWith respect to third-party service providers, our cybersecurity program includes conducting due diligence and\nvendor risk assessment of relevant service providers’ cybersecurity programs prior to onboarding, as well as\nongoing monitoring through our third-party risk management policies and programs. We also contractually require\nthird-party service providers with access to our information technology systems, sensitive business data, or\npersonal information to implement and maintain appropriate security controls and provide for contractual\nrestrictions on their ability to use our data. We work with these third-party service providers to help ensure\ntheir cybersecurity protocols are appropriate to the risk presented by\n49\nTable of Contents\ntheir access to or use of our systems and/or data, including notification and coordination concerning incidents\noccurring on third-party systems that may affect us.Our service providers are contractually required to notify us\npromptly of security incidents that may affect our systems or data, including personal information.\nTo date, risks from cybersecurity threats have not materially affected our business or operations. Although we have\ninvested in the protection of our data and information technology, and monitor our systems on an ongoing basis,\nthere can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful in preventing our information technology systems\nfrom being compromised or otherwise protecting us completely from security breaches or incidents. For additional\ninformation regarding whether any risks from cybersecurity threats, including as a result of previous cybersecurity\nincidents, have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our company, including our\nbusiness strategy, results of operations, or financial condition, please see the section titled \"Risk Factors,\" in\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the section titled “ Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business and\nOperations— We have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future\nattacks. Any actual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our\noperations, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations .”\nGovernance\nOur board of directors is responsible for overseeing risk management for the Company and administers this\nresponsibility both directly and with assistance from its committees. Our board of directors has designated our\naudit committee to administer oversight of cybersecurity risk management, which is a critical component of our\nenterprise risk management program. As such, our audit committee receives regular updates on our cybersecurity\nprogram and is actively involved in reviewing our cybersecurity and technology risks and opportunities, risk\nmitigation strategies, incident and industry trends, areas of emerging risks, and other areas of importance,\nincluding with respect to cybersecurity. Security updates are also provided to the full board of directors from\ntime to time.\nThe Company's cybersecurity risk management is jointly led by (i) for all operations other than our Wolt Operations\n(“DoorDash Operations”), DoorDash, Inc.’s Director of Security Governance, Risk, and Compliance, who is currently\nserving as interim security lead(the “Interim Security Lead”) while the Company onboards a new Chief Information\nSecurity Officer, and (ii) for our international operations conducted under Wolt and its subsidiaries (“Wolt\nOperations”), Wolt’s Chief Security Officer. The Interim Security Lead is responsible for assessing and managing\ninformation security and technology risks for DoorDash Operations and reports to the General Counsel.She has worked\nin security and technology for over 17 years, with the last 10 years spent in security leadership. She holds a\nbachelor's degree in finance and management information systems from the University of Maryland. Wolt’s Chief\nSecurity Officer is responsible for assessing and managing information security, technology, and physical security\nand safety risks for Wolt Operations, and reports to the Chief Executive Officer of Wolt. He has worked in security\nand technology for over 30 years. Each of their respective teams are composed of experienced personnel with a broad\nrange of experience across the technology industry.\nManagement is responsible for assessing, identifying, and managing material cybersecurity risks, and both the\nInterim Security Lead and Wolt’s Chief Security Officer and their respective teams meet regularly with each other\nand with members of management to review and evaluate our cybersecurity risks and risk management program. As part\nof its oversight of cybersecurity risks, our audit committee receives regular updates on the risks and status of\nboth the DoorDash and Wolt security programs. Both programs have in place coordinated cybersecurity incident\nresponse processes that set forth procedures for managing and responding to cybersecurity incidents across the\nenterprise, including the assignment of cross-functional roles and responsibilities and protocols for the\nescalation of significant incidents to members of management and our audit committee.",

          "content": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third parties (individually or as class\nactions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. When\nwe determine that we have meritorious defenses to any claims asserted, we defend ourselves vigorously; however we\nalso consider settlement of disputes when, in management’s judgment, it is in the best interests of both DoorDash\nand its shareholders to do so. For some matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of\nthe amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that\ncould potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal\nProceedings, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded or non-monetary damages.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought under California\nLabor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and\nother matters challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. Various other\nDashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our\nplatform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual Dashers,\nwith many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our independent\ncontractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney\nfiled an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified\nCalifornia Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and\nthe California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages\nand a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent\ncontractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is\nnot estimable given the status of the case.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law in September\n2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the standard in Dynamex regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies,\nsupported a campaign for Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was\napproved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners\nconsisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County\nSuperior Court to compel the State of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as\nunconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding\nthat the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based\nDrivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 filed appeals in the California First\nDistrict Court of Appeal. In March 2023, the Court of Appeal overturned the Alameda County Superior Court's ruling\nand upheld nearly all of Proposition 22 as state law. In April 2023, petitioners consisting of a number of\nindividuals and labor groups filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of California, which was granted in\nJune 2023.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIn July 2024, the Supreme Court of California upheld the Court of Appeal's March 2023 ruling, leaving nearly all of\nProposition 22 in place as state law.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws, and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nour former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies\nconcerning our business practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models,\ncompliance with consumer protection laws, privacy, cybersecurity, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’\ncompensation insurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development\nDepartment of the State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD\nissued a negative assessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the CA\nEDD’s assessment, and intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is\nuncertain and, accordingly, we have recorded an accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2024. We are currently the subject of government\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries in other jurisdictions as well, and we may in the future settle, or\nrecord accruals with respect to, such matters. Further, the results of investigations, audits, demands, and\ninquiries and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an\ninvestigation, audit, demand, or inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or\nunfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse\nimpact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or\nother incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have\nmeritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no\npending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\nhowever, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors.",

Our mission is to grow\nand empower local economies. We aim to do this by providing services that reduce friction in local commerce and\nhelp merchants better connect with consumers in their communities.\nOur primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace (our \"Marketplaces\"), and our\nCommerce Platform. Our Marketplaces operate in over 30 countries across the globe and provide an integrated suite\nof services that help merchants establish an online presence, connect with consumers in their communities, and\nsolve mission-critical challenges, such as customer acquisition, demand generation, order fulfillment,\nmerchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We also offer advertising as a value-added service through\nour Marketplaces to help merchants and consumer packaged goods companies increase consumer engagement and drive\nincremental revenue.\nOur Marketplaces compete for consumers based primarily on the selection, convenience, quality, affordability, and\nservice we provide. Our Marketplaces also offer our consumer membership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, which aim to\nlower transactional friction by reducing the delivery and service fees we charge, while providing additional\nmembership benefits.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer our Commerce Platform, which is a suite of services that help merchants\ngrow, run, and operate their businesses on their own channels. DoorDash Drive On-Demand and Wolt Drive (together,\n\"Drive\") are white-label delivery fulfillment services that generate the majority of revenue within our Commerce\nPlatform. In addition to Drive, we also provide services that help merchants establish online ordering, build\nbranded mobile apps, enable tableside order and pay, and improve customer support.\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nWe use the following financial and operational metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting\nour business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions, except percentages)                                2022            2023            2024\nTotal Orders                                                    1,736           2,161           2,583\nTotal Orders Y/Y growth                                            25  %           24  %           20  %\nMarketplace GOV                            $                   53,414       $  66,771       $  80,231\nMarketplace GOV Y/Y growth                                         27  %           25  %           20  %\nRevenue                                    $                    6,583       $   8,635       $  10,722\nRevenue Y/Y growth                                                 35  %           31  %           24  %\nNet Revenue Margin                                               12.3  %         12.9  %         13.4  %\nGAAP gross profit                          $                    2,824       $   3,860       $   4,979\nGAAP gross profit as a % of Marketplace                           5.3  %          5.8  %          6.2  %\nGOV\nContribution Profit(1)                     $                    1,567       $   2,482       $   3,474\nContribution Profit as a % of                                     2.9  %          3.7  %          4.3  %\nMarketplace GOV\nGAAP net income (loss) attributable to     $                   -1,365       $    -558       $     123\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders\nGAAP net income (loss) attributable to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders as a                          -2.6  %         -0.8  %          0.2  %\n% of Marketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                         $                      361       $   1,190       $   1,900\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                             0.7  %          1.8  %          2.4  %\nGOV\nWeighted-average diluted shares                                   371             393             430\noutstanding\n(1) Contribution Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures.

Foreign jurisdictions\nhave different statutory tax rates than those in the U.S. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be\ntaxable in the U.S.\nAccordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes\nin our stock price, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit\ndevelopments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and\nlosses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations\nrelated to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in\nvarious jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.\nAdditionally, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses varies depending on the amount of pre-tax\nincome or loss. For example, the impact of any particular item is greater when the amount of our pre-tax income or\nloss is smaller.\nWe have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Finland. We expect to maintain these\nvaluation allowances until it becomes more-likely-than-not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be\nrealized by way of expected future taxable income in the U.S. and Finland.\n(in millions,                    Year Ended\nexcept                         December 31,\npercentages)                           2022       2023       2024    2023 to 2024       $ Change    % Change\nProvision for\n(benefit from)        $                 -31    $    31    $    39                    $         8              *\nincome\ntaxes\n* Percentage not meaningful .\nIn 2024, the income tax expense increased by $8 million compared to 2023. The increase in income tax expense was\nprimarily driven by U.S. pre-tax book income and the resulting increase in U.S. cash tax liabilities, partially\noffset by losses in foreign jurisdictions for which a tax benefit can be realized.\nGiven our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that\nsufficient positive evidence may become available in a future period to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation\nallowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of U.S.\nfederal and state deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release\nis recorded. The exact timing and amount of any potential valuation allowance release are subject to change on the\nbasis of our level of sustained U.S. profitability, as well as the amount of our tax deductible stock-based\ncompensation, which is dependent upon our publicly traded share price, and macroeconomic conditions, among other\nfactors.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 – \"Income Taxes\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and\nSupplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense,\nadjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit,\nAdjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall\nassessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our\nbusiness and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to\ninvestors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance\nand future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their\nfinancial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors\nin seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these\nnon-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of\nour business over multiple periods and with other companies in our industry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted\nresearch and development expense,\n61\nTable of Contents\nadjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit,\nAdjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes\nfor, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free\nCash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial\nmeasure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and\ndevelopment expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin,\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with their\nrespective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, allocated overhead, and inventory write-off related to\nrestructuring. We exclude stock-based compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude allocated overhead as\nit is generally a fixed cost and is not directly impacted by Total Orders.

These excluded\ncosts and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, our\nhistorical Dasher pay model, and a settlement entered into in connection with an initiative to serve\nunderrepresented communities, (ii) reserves and settlements or other resolutions for or related to the collection\nof sales, indirect, and other taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) expenses related to\nsupporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification, other labor law matters, and\nprice controls, and (iv) donations as part of our relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of\nadjusted general and administrative expense because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable\nand thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification\nmatters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long\nterm as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of\nProposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\nContribution Profit\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit is\na useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct\nexpenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders. It is not a financial measure of total company\nprofitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total company profitability nor imply\nprofitability for our business. We define Contribution Profit as our gross profit less sales and marketing expense\nplus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense\nand certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, (iii) allocated\noverhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off related to\nrestructuring.

These excluded costs and expenses consist\nof (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, our historical Dasher pay model, and\na settlement entered into in connection with an initiative to serve underrepresented communities, (ii) reserves and\nsettlements or other resolutions for or related to the collection of sales, indirect, and other taxes that we do\nnot expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including\nthose related to worker classification, other labor law matters, and price controls, and (iv) donations as part of\nour relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is\nappropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because (1) the timing and\nmagnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process,\nand (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be\nmaterial to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory\ncertainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\n(2) Consists primarily of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including impairment.\n(3) Excludes stock-based compensation related to restructuring, which is included in restructuring charges in the\ntable above.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and\ncapitalized software and website development costs.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(in millions)                                                  2022        2023        2024\nNet cash provided by operating           $                      367    $  1,673    $  2,132\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment                            -176        -123        -104\nCapitalized software and website                               -170        -201        -226\ndevelopment costs\nFree Cash Flow                           $                       21    $  1,349    $  1,802\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                     -300    $   -342    $   -444\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                     -375    $   -752    $   -204\nCredit Facility\nOn November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with certain lenders, which, as\nmost recently amended and restated on April 26, 2024, provides for an $800 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility maturing on April 26, 2029, with a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face\namount of up to $600 million. As\n65\nTable of Contents\nof December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nAs amended and restated, the credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, as well as customary\nnegative covenants that restrict our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary\nindebtedness, grant liens, declare cash dividends or make certain other distributions, repurchase stock, merge or\nconsolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our and our subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole,\nmake investments and loans, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Company must also maintain\ncompliance with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined in accordance with the terms of\nthe credit agreement. As of December 31, 2023 and 2024, no revolving loans were outstanding and $115 million and\n$112 million of letters of credit were issued under our revolving credit facility, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $6.2 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 billion, and short-term marketable securities\nof $1.3 billion and long-term marketable securities of $835 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $436 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities. Marketable securities consisted of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S.\ngovernment agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, and mutual funds.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $5.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2024. We have historically funded our operations from cash from operations as well as\nthe issuance of equity securities, including in our initial public offering in December 2020. To execute on our\nstrategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and generate negative cash\nflows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources. We believe our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with the available borrowings under our revolving\ncredit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the\nnext 12 months and beyond.\nIn February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $1.1 billion. As of December 31, 2024, approximately $876\nmillion remained available under the repurchase authorization.\nIn February 2025, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $5.0 billion, which is inclusive of the remaining share\nrepurchase authority of $876 million under the share repurchase program that we previously announced in February\n2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated\ntransactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market\nrepurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We\nmay also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our Class A common stock\nunder this authorization. We may or may not repurchase any portion of the total authorized amount, and the timing\nand actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and\nmarket conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, the expansion\nof sales and marketing activities, and the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\n66\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)                                                  2022        2023        2024\nNet cash provided by operating           $                      367    $  1,673    $  2,132\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                          -300        -342        -444\nNet cash used in financing activities                          -375        -752        -204\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                           -10           5         -35\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash    $                     -318    $    584    $  1,449\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $2.1 billion for 2024 . This primarily consisted of net income including\nredeemable non-controlling interests of $117 million, adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense of\n$1.1 billion, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $561 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease\nright-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $103 million, non-cash office lease impairment\nexpenses of $83 million, and other net non-cash expenses of $33 million, as well as $136 million net inflows from\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses, partially\noffset by increases in other assets, accounts receivable, net, and prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for 2023 . This primarily consisted of a net loss including\nredeemable non-controlling interests of $565 million, adjusted for non-cash stock-based compensation expense of\n$1.1 billion, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $509 million, reduction of operating lease right-\nof-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $108 million, non-cash impairments of non-marketable\nequity securities of $101 million, and other net non-cash expenses of $15 million, as well as $417 million net\ninflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses,\npartially offset by increases in accounts receivable, net, payments for operating lease liabilities, and prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $444 million for 2024 , which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $2.0 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $104 million, and cash outflows for capitalized\nsoftware and website development costs of $226 million, partially offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities\nof marketable securities of $1.8 billion.\nCash used in investing activities was $342 million for 2023 , which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $1.9 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $123 million, cash outflows for capitalized\nsoftware and website development costs of $201 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $17\nmillion, partially offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.9 billion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $204 million for 2024 , which consisted of repurchases of our Class A common\nstock of $224 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $14 million and other\nfinancing activities of $6 million.\nCash used in financing activities was $752 million for 2023 , which consisted of repurchases of our Class A common\nstock of $750 million and cash paid for other financing activities of $8 million, partially offset by proceeds from\nthe exercise of stock options of $6 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our\n67\nTable of Contents\nestimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial\nstatement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 . We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\nconsumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash.\nRevenue from our Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the\nmerchant’s products. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which\nis recognized as part of our Marketplaces. Revenue generated from DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a\nratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of\nmembership purchased by the consumer. We also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting per-order fees\nfrom merchants that use our local commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated\nthrough their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control\nof the merchant’s products.\nOur local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a\nprincipal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation\nservice are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation\nservice and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplaces. The consumer accesses our local\ncommerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as we do not have the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor do we\nobtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our\nrole with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to\nprospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and\ndelivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\n68\nTable of Contents\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance that includes retained insurance deductibles to insure costs, including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot yet paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expense. The estimate\nof our ultimate deductible obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss\nexperience. We use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward claim and loss development\nfactors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are\nperiodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However,\nultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.\nWe review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes\nother than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these\nsecurities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the\nearly stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies, and we\nbelieve that determining the impact of market sensitivities on these investments is not practicable.\n69\nTable of Contents\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $46 million and $42 million as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Adjustments or impairments are recorded in other expense, net on the\nconsolidated statements of operations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported\nincome (loss) from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international\nbusinesses included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of\ntransaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nForeign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024. Based on\nour foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2024, we estimated that a\n10% change in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which\nis part of stockholders’ equity.\n70\nTable of Contents",

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\n72\nTable of Contents\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material\neffect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance which\ninclude retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and\nphysical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims that have\nbeen incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expense. The estimate of the Company’s retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves as of December 31, 2024 was $1.0 billion.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter.\nThe evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and\nexpected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized\nskill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s retained insurance\ndeductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by\nselecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 14,

Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”) is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The\nCompany's mission is to grow and empower local economies. The Company aims to do this by providing services that\nreduce friction in local commerce and help merchants better connect with consumers in their communities.\nThe Company's primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace (together, the\n\"Marketplaces\"), and its Commerce Platform. The Company's Marketplaces operate in over 30countries across the globe\nand provide an integrated suite of services that help merchants establish an online presence, connect with\nconsumers in their communities, and solve mission-critical challenges, such as customer acquisition, demand\ngeneration, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. The Company also offers\nadvertising as a value-added service through its Marketplaces to help merchants and consumer packaged goods\ncompanies increase consumer engagement and drive incremental revenue.\nThe Company's Marketplaces compete for consumers based primarily on the selection, convenience, quality,\naffordability, and service provided. The Company's Marketplaces also include consumer membership programs, DashPass\nand Wolt+, which aim to lower transactional friction by reducing the delivery and service fees charged, while\nproviding additional membership benefits.\nIn addition to its Marketplaces, the Company offers its Commerce Platform, which is a suite of services that help\nmerchants grow, run, and operate their businesses on their own channels. DoorDash Drive On-Demand and Wolt Drive\n(together, \"Drive\") are white-label delivery fulfillment services that generate the majority of revenue within the\nCompany's Commerce Platform. In addition to Drive, the Company also provides services that help merchants establish\nonline ordering, build branded mobile apps, enable tableside order and pay, and improve customer support.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries and entities consolidated under the variable interest entity model, and have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to\nan individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.\nThe CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it\noperates in onereportable segment.See Note 3 – \"Revenue\" of these notes to the Company's consolidated financial\nstatements for revenue by geography and Note 15 – \"Segment Reporting\" for significant expenses regularly provided\nto the Company's CODM. Long-lived assets, which consist of property and equipment, net and operating lease right-\nof-use assets, located outside of the United States were $ 167million and $ 200million as of December 31, 2023 and\n2024, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related\ndisclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit\nlosses, gift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website\ndevelopment costs, intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other\nfinancial instruments\n80\nTable of Contents\nincluding valuation of investments without readily determinable fair values, valuation of acquired intangible\nassets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, impairment of long-lived assets,\ninsurance reserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these\nestimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as\nincurred.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities.\nRestricted cash consists of bank accounts that are legally restricted for use, including certain amounts collected\non the behalf of, but not yet remitted to, merchants, which are restricted in compliance with certain regulatory\nrequirements, and collateral provided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and\ninsurance policies. Restricted cash is classified as either current or non-current assets based on the estimated\nterm of the remaining restriction.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, U.S. Treasury securities, corporate bonds, and mutual funds. The Company invests in a diversified\nportfolio of marketable securities and limits the concentration of its investment in any particular security.\nSecurities with maturities greater than three months, but less than one year, are included in current assets and\nsecurities with maturities greater than one year are included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance\nsheets. All marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the Company\nevaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors considered in\ndetermining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the amortized cost\nbasis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically related to the\nsecurity, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an allowance for\ncredit losses reported in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. The allowance is limited\nby the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis. When a credit loss\nexists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the debt security with\nthe amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be recorded. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, no allowance of credit losses related to marketable securities was recorded. Unrealized\nlosses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher and merchant payouts. Funds held\nat payment\n81\nTable of Contents\nprocessors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for transactions with consumers, as well as\nfunds transferred to payment processors for Dasher and merchant payouts.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive and Marketplace related offerings. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on\nthe Company’s assessment of the collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the\nallowance for credit losses on a collective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each\ncustomer’s expected ability to pay and collection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and\nsupportable forecasts of future economic conditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts\nreceivable deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment\nunder the long-lived asset model described under “ Impairment of Long-Lived A ssets” below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2024 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Nogoodwill impairment charge was\nrecorded in any of the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities that the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in and does not\nexercise significant influence over the investee are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for\nsame or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement alternative).\nThe carrying value is not adjusted for the Company’s non-marketable equity securities if there are no observable\nprice changes in a same or similar investment of the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment.\n82\nTable of Contents\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurs costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the\npost implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform\nare capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and\ncommitted project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\nintended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized\nand expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair\nvalue less costs to sell.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes third-party insurance that includes retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot yet paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported and any loss adjustment expense. The estimate\nof the Company’s ultimate deductible obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss\nexperience. The Company utilizes assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward claim and loss\ndevelopment factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates.\nReserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes\nknown. However, ultimate results may differ from the Company’s estimates, which could result in losses over the\nCompany’s reserved amounts.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024, the Company recorded additions to the insurance reserves\nof $ 359million, $ 518million and $ 526million, respectively. The Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves\nas of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $ 758million and $ 1.0billion, respectively.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and\nunrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s\nnon-U.S. subsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into\nU.S. dollars.\n83\nTable of Contents\nAssets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are translated\nusing average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant. With the exception of the CEO Performance Award and options assumed via acquisition (as\ndiscussed further in Note 10 - \"Common Stock\"), the Company only granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a\nservice-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award (as discussed below in Note 10 - \"Common Stock\"), which includes a market-based\ncondition, the fair value of the award was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-\nbased compensation is recorded over the derived service period, using the accelerated attribution method. If the\nstock price goals are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will adjust the stock-based\ncompensation expense to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested award. Provided that Tony Xu\ncontinues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the\nrequisite service period, regardless of whether the stock price goals are achieved.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply for the years in which differences are expected to reverse. The\nCompany recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that includes the\nenactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net amount that\nit believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both positive and\nnegative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of future income,\nand other relevant factors. Our judgment regarding levels of future profitability are consistent with plans and\nestimates used to manage the business; however, actual operating results in future years could differ from our\ncurrent assumptions, judgments and estimates. Should there be a change in the ability to recover deferred tax\nassets, our income tax provision would increase or decrease, as applicable, in the period in which the assessment\nis changed.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which\nmay require periodic adjustments. Due to uncertainties in any tax audit outcome, our estimates of the ultimate\nsettlement of our unrecognized tax positions may change and the actual tax benefit may differ significantly from\nthe estimates. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\n84\nTable of Contents\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due\nto their short maturities.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, exceed federally insured limits. Management believes that\nthe institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits purchases\nof debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit losses\nhistorically.\nPayment processors are financial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit\nquality. The Company retains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processors, which are included in\nfunds held at payment processors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be\nremitted to Dashers and merchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the\nCompany pre-authorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive and Marketplace related offerings.As of December 31, 2023, one entity in dividually accounted for 13% of\naccounts receivable, net. As of December 31, 2024, one entity in dividually accounted for 13% of accounts\nreceivable, net. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and\n2024.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through its Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to\npartner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a\ncontractual agreement with the Company. Revenue from the Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership fees paid\nby consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part of the Marketplaces . Revenue generated from the\nCompany’s DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is\ngenerally one monthto one yeardepending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, the\nCompany also generates revenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its\nlocal commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels.\nRevenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\ncommerce platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local commerce platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\n85\nTable of Contents\nThe Company’s local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation\nservice and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item\nseparately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable\nas the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service\nindividually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on\nwhether it controls each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace\ntransactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through its Marketplaces. The consumer accesses the Company’s\nlocal commerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked\nup from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the products prior to\nthem being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer\nnor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of its delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the\nCompany’s role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered\nto prospective Dashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of its transactions with end-users, the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of\nproducts and delivery services, thus the Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from\nconsumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nDasher payout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for\ncertain referral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a\nreduction in Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled within a week.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nThe Company also provides value-added services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. The majority of gift cards\nsold have no expiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. When gift cards are\nredeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less\namounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. The Company also estimates the portion of outstanding gift cards that\nwill never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for which there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed\ngift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. The Company recognizes the breakage\namounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. The Company\nrecorded $ 47million, $ 41million and $ 46million of gift card breakage revenue during the years ended December 31,\n2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and\nhistorical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate. For jurisdictions\nwhere gift cards have expiration dates, the Company recognizes breakage when they expire.\n86\nTable of Contents\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local commerce platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below.\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. The majority of new consumer acquisition costs is expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.Advertising expenses were $ 1.1billion, $ 1.3billion, and $ 1.3billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nNet Income (Loss) Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per common share following the two-class method required for multiple\nclasses of common stock and participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and\nparticipating securities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the\nperiod had been distributed. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common\nstock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock are substantially identical, other than voting rights.\nAccordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B\n87\nTable of Contents\ncommon stock shared proportionately in the Company’s net income and losses. Noshares of Class C common stock were\nissued and outstanding as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nBasic net income (loss) per share is computed by dividing the net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders\nby the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to\nrepurchase. The diluted net income (loss) per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive\nsecurities outstanding for the period. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per\ncommon share is the same as basic net loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-\ndilutive. Vested RSUs that have not been settled have been included in the appropriate common share class used to\ncalculate basic and diluted net income (loss) per share.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nROU assets represents the Company's right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresents the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company has elected the\npractical expedient of not recognizing ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with terms of twelve\nmonths or less. Expense related to short-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as\nincurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. ROU assets are recognized as the lease\nliability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the\nfuture lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real\nestate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating\nlease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases\nconsist of equipment leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and activities related to finance leases were not\nmaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from twoto six years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no residual\nvalue guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ntypically borrow on a collateralized basis, it uses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for\ncollateralization, current available yield curves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate\nincremental borrowing rate.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if it has a variable\ninterest in an entity and if it is the primary beneficiary. These evaluations are complex and involve judgment and\nthe use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other\nfactors. If the Company determines that entities for which the Company holds a contractual or ownership interest in\nare variable interest entities (\"VIE\") and that the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates\nsuch entities in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets\nboth of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either\ncase could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company determines whether any changes in the\ninterest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether the Company is still the primary\nbeneficiary. If the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the Company accounts for the\ninvestment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP. Refer\n88\nTable of Contents\nto Note 14 - \"Variable Interest Entities\" of these notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for\nfurther information.\nRestructuring\nCosts and liabilities associated with management-approved restructuring activities are recognized when they are\nincurred. One-time employee termination costs are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless\nfuture service is required, in which case the costs are recognized over the future service period. Ongoing employee\ntermination benefits are recognized as a liability when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is\nreasonably estimable. Restructuring charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated\nstatements of operations and related liabilities are recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates\nbased on currently available information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements. ASU\n2023-07 expands segment disclosures by requiring disclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly\nprovided to the CODM and included within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description\nof its composition for other segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and\nassets. Additionally, the amendments require disclosure of the title and position of the CODM and an explanation of\nhow the CODM uses the reported measure(s) of segment profit or loss in assessing segment performance and deciding\nhow to allocate resources. All disclosure requirements of ASU 2023-07 are required for entities with a single\nreportable segment. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods\nwithin fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07\non January 1, 2024 and applied the amendment retrospectively to all prior periods presented on the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements. See Note 15 – \"Segment Reporting\" of these notes to the Company's consolidated\nfinancial statements for additional information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU 2024-03, \"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense\nDisaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"), which\nrequires disclosure, on an annual and interim basis, of specified information about certain costs and expenses in\nthe notes to financial statements. ASU 2024-03 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,\n2026, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The\nCompany is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial\nstatements and disclosures.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomposed of the Company's Marketplaces and Commerce Platform.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of the Company's\nmembership products, the address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022        2023         2024\nUnited States       $                    6,251    $  7,781    $   9,403\nInternational(1)                           332         854        1,319\nTotal revenue       $                    6,583    $  8,635    $  10,722\n(1) No individual country outside the United States represented 10% or more of total consolidated revenue for the\nperiods presented.\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance\n89\nTable of Contents\nsheets, is primarily composed of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers and merchants, certain\nconsumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized over time. A summary of\nactivities related to contract liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2024\nBeginning balance                          $                           308\nAddition to contract liabilities                                     2,813\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                             -2,725\nEnding balance                             $                           396\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 181million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2024. The ending\nbalance of unearned prepayments is expected to be recognized as revenue in 12 months or less.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense\nand amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue,\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations.

Acquisitions\nWolt Acquisition\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100percent of the outstanding equity interests of Wolt\nEnterprise Oy (“Wolt”). Wolt was acquired to help the Company accelerate its product development, increase its\ninternational scale, bring greater focus to its markets outside the United States, and improve the value provided\nto\n90\nTable of Contents\nconsumers, merchants, and Dashers around the world. The Company’s acquisition-related costs were $ 48million and\nall costs were recorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of\noperations during the period in which they were incurred. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred for Wolt was $ 2,838million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nDoorDash Class A common stock             $       2,705\nStock-based compensation awards\n(DoorDash options, RSUs, and revesting                   133\ncommon stock) attributable to\npre-combination services\nTotal consideration                       $       2,838\nThe fair value of 36million shares of Class A common stock issued was determined on the basis of the closing market\nprice of the Company’s Class A common stock on the acquisition date. The Company also issued certain stock-based\ncompensation awards and their fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the\napplicable assumptions as of the acquisition date for options ( 1.7million DoorDash options) and using the closing\nmarket price of the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date for RSUs ( 1.4million DoorDash RSUs).\nFor certain Wolt employees, a portion of their total consideration transferred was restricted subject to revesting\nover a service period, including 568thousand shares of the Company's Class A common stock. This restricted equity\nconsideration is considered compensation for post-combination services and is being recognized as stock-based\ncompensation expense over the four yearperiod following the acquisition, based on the fair value of the shares\nusing the closing market price of the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date.\nThe total purchase consideration of the Wolt acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The\nCompany recorded $ 1,997million of goodwill, which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net assets\nacquired. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Wolt and anticipated synergies from the\nfuture growth and strategic advantages in the global local commerce industry. The goodwill recorded in connection\nwith the acquisition of Wolt is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, with the assistance of an independent third-party\nvaluation firm.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMay 31, 2022\nCurrent assets                   $           272\nIntangible assets                            772\nGoodwill                                   1,997\nOther non-current assets                      82\nCurrent liabilities                         -204\nDeferred tax liability, net                  -34\nOther non-current liabilities                -47\nTotal purchase price             $         2,838\nThe following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their estimated\nuseful life as of the date of acquisition (in years):\nEstimated Useful\nLife       May 31, 2022\nMerchant relationships                            11    $           236\nTrademark                                         10                268\nExisting technology                                6                150\nCustomer relationships                             3                107\nCourier relationships                              1                 11\nTotal acquired intangible assets                        $           772\n91\nTable of Contents\nExisting technology represents the existing online and mobile Wolt platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and\npickup orders. The merchant, customer, and courier relationships represent the fair value of the underlying\nrelationships with merchants, such as restaurants and grocery stores, users of Wolt’s food and delivery services,\nand courier partners. The estimated fair values of the existing technology and trademarks were determined using a\nrelief from royalty method. The fair values of the merchant, courier and customer relationships were determined\nusing a replacement cost method. The Company expects to amortize the fair value of these intangible assets on a\nstraight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.\nFrom the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022, the amount of revenue and net loss from Wolt included in\nthe consolidated statements of operations were $ 259million and $ 345million, respectively.\nThe following unaudited pro forma results presents the combined revenue and net loss as if the Wolt acquisition had\nbeen completed on January 1, 2021, the beginning of the Company's fiscal 2021. The unaudited pro forma information\nis based on estimates and assumptions which the Company believes are reasonable and primarily reflects adjustments\nfor the pro forma impact of additional amortization related to the fair value of acquired intangible assets and\ntransaction costs. The unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are not\nnecessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been if the\nacquisition had occurred on January 1, 2021, nor are they indicative of future results of operations. The unaudited\npro forma results were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nRevenue     $                         6,734\nNet loss    $                        -1,549\nBbot Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired Bbot, a hospitality technology company. The addition of Bbot's products and\ntechnology to the Company's platform offers merchants more solutions for their in-store and online channels,\nincluding in-store digital ordering and payments. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of\naccounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $ 88million in cash, including a $ 9million\nindemnification holdback, which was settled during the three month period ended June 30, 2023.\nThe total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities\nassumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the anticipated\nsynergies from the future growth opportunities from the adoption of Bbot’s technology by the Company’s merchants.\nThe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management's best estimate and assumptions,\nwith the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMarch 1, 2022\nCurrent assets          $             11\nIntangible assets                     18\nGoodwill                              60\nOther liabilities                     -1\nTotal purchase price    $             88\nThe intangible assets acquired consisted of existing technology and customer relationships, which had estimated\nremaining useful lives of 5and 3years as of the date of the acquisition, respectively.\nThe acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\n92\nTable of Contents\n5.

Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2025 and 2035. Certain\nof these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant\nallowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term.\nIn June 2024, the Company ceased use of and made available for sublease certain corporate office spaces. As a\nresult, the Company determined that the asset groups, which primarily consist of the related operating lease right-\nof-use assets and leasehold improvements, were impaired, and recognized an impairment charge of $ 83million\nrecorded as general and administrative expenses during the year ended December 31, 2024. The fair value of the\nasset groups was estimated using an income-approach based on estimated future cash flows expected to be derived\nfrom the office spaces based on current sublease market rent.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and\ninquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices,\nthe classification and compensation of Dashers, the DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with consumer protection\nlaws, privacy, cybersecurity, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and other\nmatters. For example, the Company is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of\nCalifornia (the “CA EDD”) for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued an assessment for certain\namounts that it found to be owed by the Company on behalf of Dashers due to their being classified as independent\ncontractors. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously appeal such adverse\nassessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is uncertain and, accordingly, the Company has recorded\nan accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets\nas of December 31, 2024. The results of investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries and related governmental\naction are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, demand, or\ninquiry having a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n98\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to\nemployees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other\nallegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the\nCompany from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company's technology. The terms of\nthese indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement.\nIn addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers of the Company, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct\nof the individual.\nThe maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements. Noliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2023 and 2024.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of data processing and\ntechnology platform infrastructure. These purchase commitments are not recorded as liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheet as of December 31, 2024 as the Company has not yet received the related services. As of December 31,\n2024, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-cancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2025                                   316\n2026                                   372\n2027                                   285\n2028                                    87\n2029                                     8\nTotal future minimum payments    $   1,068\nInsurance Collateral\nThe Company is required to maintain $ 692million in collateral in connection with certain insurance policies, which\ncan be held in a combination of cash, surety bonds, and letters of credit. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had\n$ 692million of collateral outstanding in the form of surety bonds and letters of credit in connection with the\ninsurance collateral requirement.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement, which, as most recently\namended and restated on April 26, 2024, provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $ 800million,\nwith a letter of credit sublimit of $ 600million, maturing on April 26, 2029. Loans under the revolving credit\nfacility bear interest at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted\nSOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of\none, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees\nfor a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused\ncommitment fee of 0.10%. The Company's obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of\nits domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the credit agreement. The credit agreement\ncontains customary affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants that\n99\nTable of Contents\nrestrict the Company's ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness,\ngrant liens, declare cash dividends or make certain other distributions, repurchase stock, merge or consolidate\nwith other companies or sell substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole,\nmake investments and loans, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Company must also maintain\ncompliance with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined in accordance with the terms of\nthe credit agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2023 and 2024, norevolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\nIn addition to the letters of credit maintained in connection with the insurance collateral requirement, the\nCompany also maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024, the Company had $ 138million and $ 141million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $ 115million and $ 112million, respectively, were issued from the revolving credit and\nguaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities as they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. The Company is under audit by various state, local, and foreign tax authorities with regard to\nsales and indirect tax matters. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly uncertain, and\nthe amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may differ from\nthe amounts accrued.\n10. Common Stock\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2024, the Company authorized the repurchase of Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount of up to $\n1.1billion. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company repurchased 2.1million shares of its Class A\ncommon stock at a weighted average price of $ 105.12per share for a total amount of $ 224million. The shares were\nretired immediately upon repurchase.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company granted restricted stock to certain continuing employees in connection with the Wolt acquisition.\nVesting of this stock is dependent on the respective employee’s continued employment at the Company during the\nrequisite service period, which is generally up to four yearsfrom the issuance date. The fair value of the\nrestricted stock issued to employees that is subject to post-acquisition employment is recorded as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe activities for the restricted stock issued to employees was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nWeighted-\nNumber of                    Average\nUnvested restricted stock as of December       Shares                 Grant Date\n31, 2023                                          285       Fair Value Per Share\nGranted                                             —    $                     —\nVested                                           -193    $                 76.91\nForfeited                                           —    $                     —\nUnvested restricted stock as of December           92\n31, 2024\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\n100\nTable of Contents\nStock options issued and outstanding       December 31, 2023    December 31, 2024\nunder the 2014 Plan and Inducement Plan                9,022                4,516\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 Plan,                 37,822               29,566\n2020 Plan and Inducement Plan\nRemaining shares available for future                 50,137               64,481\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                6,499                6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                                103,480              105,062\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the \"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vested over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapsed over time as the shares vested at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based awards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of\nshares of common stock available for issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014\nPlan. All outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to\nthe terms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO registration statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock\nappreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the\nCompany's employees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are\nforfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on\nJanuary 1, 2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total\nnumber of all classes of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each\nautomatic increase, or (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to\nthe applicable January 1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nthe Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten\nyears(or five yearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at\nprices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the\nexercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110%\nof the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest\nover four years.\n2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan\nIn May 2022, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the “Inducement\nPlan”), pursuant to which the Company reserved 9,760,000shares of Class A common stock to be used exclusively for\ngrants of equity-based awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company, as a\nmaterial inducement to the individual’s entry into employment with the Company. The Inducement Plan permits the\ngrant\n101\nTable of Contents\nof nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and performance\nshares. Shares that actually have been issued under the Inducement Plan under any award will not be returned to the\nInducement Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Inducement Plan; however, if shares\nissued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares or performance units are repurchased by the\nCompany or are forfeited to the Company due to failure to vest, such shares will become available for future grant\nunder the Inducement Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to satisfy the tax withholding\nobligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under the Inducement Plan. The\nexercise price, term, and any other terms and conditions of the options granted under the Inducement Plan will be\ndetermined by the administrator of the plan.\nRSUs\nThe Company generally grants RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition, which\nis generally four years. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite\nservice period.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the Company’s\nIPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches that are\neligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share, each of\nwhich are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day calendar period during\nthe performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if the\nCompany achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided\nthat Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\n102\nTable of Contents\nThe Company recorded $ 112million, $ 104million, and $ 67million of stock-based compensation expense related to the\nCEO Performance Award during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively. As of December 31,\n2024, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 7million, which is\nexpected to be recognized over the remaining period of 0.32years.\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 Plan, 2020 Plan, and Inducement Plan was as follows (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                    Average\nShares       Weighted-    Remaining\nsubject to         Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nOptions        Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nOutstanding           Price    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December 31, 2023                      9,022    $       4.38                 3.41    $        853\nGranted                                                  —    $          —\nExercised                                           -4,504    $       3.04                         $        580\nCancelled and forfeited                                 -2    $       2.63\nBalance as of December 31, 2024                      4,516    $       5.72                 3.18    $        732\nExercisable as of December 31, 2024                  4,300    $       5.79                 3.24    $        696\nVested and expected to vest as of                    4,516    $       5.72                 3.18    $        732\nDecember 31, 2024\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market as of\nthe respective year-end dates.

The weighted-average fair\nvalue per share of RSUs granted and assumed via acquisition during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and\n2024 was $ 74.16, $ 65.06, and $ 128.17, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe Company estimated the fair value of stock options assumed via acquisition using the Black-Scholes option-\npricing model. Key assumptions of the Black-Scholes valuation model are the risk-free interest rate, expected\nvolatility, expected term and expected dividends. The Company determined the expected term of assumed in the money\noption awards by considering vesting provisions, the expected exercise behavior, and contractual term of the\nawards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in\nduration to the expected term of the stock option awards. The Company developed the expected volatility using the\naverage volatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of similar publicly traded peer\ncompanies. The Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring dividends on\nits common stock.\n103\nTable of Contents\nThere were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, except for the\noptions assumed via acquisition in 2022.

Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $ 257million, $ 203million, and $ 494million in the\nyears ended December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company had accumulated U.S. federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n1.8billion and $ 1.7billion, respectively. Federal net operating losses carry forward indefinitely. Of the $\n1.7billion of state net operating losses, $ 559million carry forward indefinitely. The remaining state net\noperating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2025. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had foreign net\noperating loss carryforwards of $ 1.7billion that begin to expire in 2025.\nThe Company also had $ 417million and $ 213million of federal and state research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards, respectively, as of December 31, 2024. The federal research and development tax credits expire in\nvarying amounts starting in 2041. The California research credits do not expire and carry forward indefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited\nin the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of\n1986, as amended, and similar state tax law. Based on the most recent analysis, the Company does not anticipate a\ncurrent limitation on the tax attributes under Section 382 and 383.\nThe Company intends to invest substantially all of its foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as its capital in its\nforeign subsidiaries, indefinitely in those jurisdictions in which the Company could incur significant, additional\ncosts upon repatriation of such amounts.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022       2023       2024\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                       69    $    69    $   183\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                               19         47         64\npositions\nIncreases related to prior year tax                                  —         67         28\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                -19          —          —\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                       69    $   183    $   275\nThe Company had $ 275million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, the majority of which\nwould not impact its effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company's valuation allowance. The Company does\nnot anticipate that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at December 31, 2024\nwill significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes, which were not material for the periods presented.\nThe Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and various state and foreign jurisdictions. The material\njurisdictions in which the Company operates include the United States and Finland. The Company’s 2013 and\nsubsequent tax years remain open to examination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Company’s 2018 and\nsubsequent tax years remain open to examination in Finland.\n12. Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to DoorDash, Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders using the two-\nclass method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the\nliquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than\nvoting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net\nincome and losses. The computation of diluted net income per share of Class A common stock for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2024 does not assume the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock because including\nsuch shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders during the periods presented. RSUs that vested but have not been settled are\nincluded in the denominator in calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per share (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\n105\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022                        2023                        2024\nClass A       Class B       Class A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nBasic net income\n(loss) per share\nNumerator\nNet income\n(loss) including\nredeemable          $              -1,260    $     -108    $     -525    $      -40    $      109    $        8\nnon-controlling\ninterests\nLess: Net loss\nattributable to\nredeemable                             -3             —            -7             —            -6             —\nnon-controlling\ninterests\nNet income\n(loss)\nattributable to                    -1,257          -108          -518           -40           115             8\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nDenominator\nWeighted-average\nnumber of shares\noutstanding used\nto compute basic\nnet\nincome (loss)                     342,015        29,398       365,340        27,608       384,692        26,859\nper share\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nBasic net income\n(loss) per share\nattributable to     $               -3.68    $    -3.68    $    -1.42    $    -1.42    $     0.30    $     0.30\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2022                        2023                        2024\nClass A       Class B       Class A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nDiluted net\nincome (loss)\nper share\nNumerator\nNet income\n(loss)\nattributable to     $              -1,257    $     -108    $     -518    $      -40    $      115    $        8\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nDenominator\nWeighted-average\nnumber of shares\noutstanding used\nto compute basic\nnet\nincome (loss)                     342,015        29,398       365,340        27,608       384,692        26,859\nper share\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nWeighted-average\neffect of\npotentially                             —             —             —             —        18,691             —\ndilutive\nsecurities\nWeighted-average\nnumber of shares\noutstanding used\nto compute\ndiluted net\nincome (loss)                     342,015        29,398       365,340        27,608       403,383        26,859\nper share\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nDiluted net\nincome (loss)\nper share\nattributable to     $               -3.68    $    -3.68    $    -1.42    $    -1.42    $     0.29    $     0.29\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet income (loss) per share because including such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such\nshares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied at the end of the\nrespective periods (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2022      2023      2024\nStock options to purchase common stock                       16,021     9,022         —\nUnvested restricted stock and restricted                     45,172    38,072    10,801\nstock units\nEscrow shares                                                 2,012        72        72\nTotal                                                        63,205    47,166    10,873\n13. Employee Benefit Plans\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion\nof their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. In 2023, the Company began to make\ndiscretionary matching contributions to those participating employees who met certain employment criteria. The\nCompany's matching contributions to the plan were not material for the years ended December 31, 2023, and 2024.\n106\nTable of Contents\nDefined Benefit Plan\nEmployees based in Finland are covered under the Finnish Employees’ Pension Act (“TyEL”). TyEL is a statutory\nprivate sector pension act that is partly funded and paid through a pay-as-you-go pool. The Old-age Pension and\nDisability Pension benefits of TyEL are classified as postretirement benefits under defined benefit plan accounting\nstandards and based on an actuarial valuation. The Old-age Pension liability for active employees includes the\neffect of future salary increases. The Disability Pension liability for active employees is based on employees'\ntotal salary two years before the fiscal year.\nNet periodic benefit cost is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Service cost is\nreflected in total costs and expenses. Other components of net periodic benefit cost, including interest cost and\namortization of actuarial gains and losses, is included in other expense, net. Actuarial gains and losses resulting\nfrom remeasurement are initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized\nin the consolidated statements of operations.\n14. Variable Interest Entities\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company formed a joint venture with a retail partner in Canada with the objective of providing\non-demand delivery of grocery and convenience items to customers in Canada (the \"JV\"). The Company owns a majority\ninterest in the JV.\nIn connection with the formation of the JV, the Company had committed to contribute cash and certain assets worth $\n98million Canadian dollars (approximately $ 73million US dollars) over three years. Upon the closing of the\ntransaction, the Company contributed cash and certain assets of $ 41million Canadian dollars (approximately $\n32million US dollars). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company contributed cash of $ 18million\nCanadian dollars (approximately $ 13million US dollars). Additional capital contributions will be made in a manner\nthat preserves the ownership percentage of each shareholder.\nThe common units held by the Company in the JV were determined to be a variable interest. The Company is the\nprimary beneficiary because the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the\nperformance of the JV. As a result, the Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of the JV.\nTotal assets of the JV included on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2023 and 2024 were $ 39million\nand $ 32million, respectively. Total liabilities of the JV included on the consolidated balance sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2023 and 2024 were $ 11million and $ 8million, respectively.\nThe JV’s assets may only be used to settle the JV’s obligations and may not be used for other consolidated\nentities. The JV’s liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of the Company’s other consolidated entities.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, the minority shareholder’s ownership in the JV is classified as redeemable non-\ncontrolling interest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in the Company’s control. The\nredeemable non-controlling interest is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that\nthe non-controlling interest will become redeemable. Total redeemable non-controlling interest was $ 7million and $\n7million as of December 31, 2023 and 2024, respectively. Net loss attributable to redeemable non-controlling\ninterest was $ 3million, $ 7million and $ 6million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2023 and 2024,\nrespectively.\n15. Segment Reporting\nThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.

Subsequent Events\nIn February 2025, the Company announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of\nshares of its Class A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $ 5.0billion, which is inclusive of the\nremaining share repurchase authority of $ 876million under the share repurchase program that was previously\nannounced by the Company in February 2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases\nor through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other\nrelevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule\n10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate\nrepurchases of its Class A common stock under this authorization. The Company may or may not repurchase any portion\nof the total authorized amount, and the timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of\nfactors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.\n108\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer\n(“certifying officers”), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period\ncovered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our certifying officers have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2024.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management, under the oversight of our board\nof directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations\nof internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n109\nTable of Contents",
