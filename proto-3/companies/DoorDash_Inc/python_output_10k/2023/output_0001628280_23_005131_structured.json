          "content": "Item 1. Business\nOUR BUSINESS\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to achieve this by providing logistics, technology, and\nother services that enable local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy.\nOur primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace, which operates in four countries including the United\nStates, the Wolt Marketplace, which operates in 23 countries, and Platform Services. We built the DoorDash and Wolt\nMarketplaces (our \"Marketplaces\") to serve the needs of three key constituents: merchants, consumers, and the\nindependent contractors who use our platform to generate earnings, or \"Dashers 1 .\" Our Marketplaces enable\nmerchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers.\nMerchants can fulfill this demand through delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-\nperson pickup by consumers. As part of our Marketplaces, we offer merchants a broad array of services that enable\nthem to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order fulfillment,\nmerchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our\nplatform in order to acquire new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nOur Marketplaces provide a platform for over 32 million monthly active users 2 to discover, engage with, and\npurchase goods from merchants in their community. Our aim is to consistently improve our consumer value proposition\nby increasing the quantity and variety of merchants that are available on our Marketplaces, while also improving\nthe level of convenience, quality, and service we provide. Our Marketplaces also offer our membership programs,\nDashPass and Wolt+, which aim to improve affordability and lower transactional friction by reducing the delivery\nand service fees we charge consumers. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 15 million 3 DashPass and Wolt+ members.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, which account for the vast majority of our revenue today, we offer several\nservices on our platform (\"Platform Services\"), primarily consisting of DoorDash Drive and Wolt Drive (\"Drive\"),\nwhich are white-label delivery fulfillment services that enable merchants that have generated consumer demand\nthrough their own channels to fulfill this demand using our platform. Platform Services also includes DoorDash\nStorefront (\"Storefront\"), which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience,\nproviding them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-\nhouse engineering or logistics capabilities, and Bbot (\"Bbot\"), which offers merchants digital ordering and payment\nsolutions for their in-store and online channels.\nFor Dashers, our Marketplaces and Platform Services provide opportunities for those looking for accessible and\nflexible ways to earn and achieve their goals. Dashers choose when and where to dash, as well as how frequently and\nfor how long to dash each time they choose to do so.\nWe believe our business benefits only when we provide attractive services for each of our three key constituents:\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. Consequently, in order to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with\na growing suite of services that help them build and grow their businesses; consumers with a broad selection of\nmerchants and products to choose from, consistent and high-quality experiences, and affordability that drives\nincreased adoption; and Dashers with an attractive combination of accessibility, flexibility, choice, and earning\nopportunity that competes effectively for their time.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the\n1 Dashers that use our DoorDash Marketplace and Wolt Marketplace are referred to as \"DoorDash Dashers\" and \"Wolt\ncourier partners,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplaces in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2022.\n3 Excluding Wolt+ members, DashPass members were also over 15 million as of December 31, 2022.\n6\nTable of Contents\nscale of our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services\nthat enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants and\nproducts available, the quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability. We believe\nthat we are positioned favorably based on the combination of merchant selection, experience, and value we provide.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our\nplatform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, and earnings potential. We believe that\nwe are well-positioned based on the limited requirements necessary to qualify, the density of our network, the\nimproving efficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive.\nGlobally, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway\n(including Grubhub, which it acquired in June 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online\nordering platforms, online ordering systems, other merchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets,\ngrocers and grocery delivery services, convenience and convenience store delivery services, and companies that\nprovide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. We also compete with traditional offline ordering\nchannels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as\nadvertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. With Drive, and as we continue to\nexpand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete with large Internet companies with\nsubstantial resources, users, and market and brand power. As we continue to expand our presence internationally, we\nwill also face competition from local incumbents in these markets.\nWe believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution\nhave allowed us to quickly extend our network and geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to expand\nwithin our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information about\nthe risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “ Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nBusiness and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. ”\nHUMAN CAPITAL\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had over 16,800 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None\nof our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that\nour employee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\nDashers\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social\nprogress. In 2022, well over 6 million people dashed 4 , earning a total of over $13 billion.\nWe believe access and choice are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an\nopportunity to earn incremental income in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors,\nwe must compete for their time and effort with every order. We compete against other earning opportunities as well\nas alternative uses of time like doing errands or leisure. Because of this competition, we must make dashing\nattractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices available. Specifically, we strive to make dashing\npositive based on:\nAccessibility : We believe the barriers-to-entry in dashing are very low. Where permitted by applicable law,\nprospective Dashers must pass a background check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or\n4 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past year,\nmeasured as of December 31, 2022.\n7\nTable of Contents\ncar. People who qualify to become Dashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up.\nWe know of no other earning opportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\nFlexibility : Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash\nfor, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earning needs. It also allows\nDashers to generate earnings around other commitments in their lives, which often include full or part-time jobs,\nschool, parenting, or commitments to care for family or friends.\nEarnings : Dashers dash in order to earn income, so we must provide earnings that are competitive with\nalternative opportunities and commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of\nearnings, we provide tools that improve immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by\nDashers.\nService : We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is\naccessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and\npractices for determining ratings and deactivations.\nOur mission to grow and empower local economies creates a culture that promotes progress in all of our stakeholder\nrelationships. Just as importantly, our business cannot thrive, or even survive, without Dashers. As a result, our\nbusiness and financial ambitions are well aligned with our goal to make dashing an attractive and incremental\nearning opportunity that promotes social progress by giving people more choice in how they achieve their financial\ngoals.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ngeographies we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and\nretain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we\namplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the\ntools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\nElevate\nElevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company.\nThe year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership\nteam, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (\"ERGs\"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We\ncurrently have eight ERGs: Black@DoorDash, Unidos@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash (LGBTQIA+),\nAAPI@DoorDash (Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders), Veterans@DoorDash, Indigenous@DoorDash, and\nParents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.\nMitigating Bias Mandatory Training\nDuring our talent review cycles, we provide custom-designed training to all people managers, focused on educating\nleaders on unconscious bias, upskilling leaders on mitigation tactics, and creating accountability through a scaled\nBias Busters Program to ensure every room has a voice dedicating to mitigating bias. A self-guided online training\nis mandatory for people managers of all levels, and a live, instructor-led training course with practical\napplication exercises is mandatory for more senior leaders.\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\n8\nTable of Contents\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2022, we had 206 issued U.S. patents, 6 patents issued in foreign jurisdictions, 57 U.S. patent applications\npending, and 19 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts\nto assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2022, we held 44 registered trademarks in the United States and\n122 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous\npending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered\ndomain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and\ncost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the\nfuture or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “\nRisk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third\nparties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and reputation ” and “ Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperation s.”\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions.

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\npart or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future;\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely\naffected;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or\nplatform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nincluding in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected;\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful;\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected;\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result;\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (the \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n11\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval; and\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\nsuccessfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own, including in the case of our\nacquisition of Wolt;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate, including with\nrespect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline prices;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\nhire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of operations may\nnot be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nWe have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced\nby growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding\nthese risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do\nnot address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and\nwe may not be able to achieve profitability, or maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net\nloss of $468 million and $1,365 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we\nhad an accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion and $3.8 billion. We expect our costs will increase over time and our\nlosses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and operating\nas a public company. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on\ndeveloping our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features\nand services, acquiring and integrating technologies and businesses, expanding into new markets and categories, and\nincreasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in\nsufficient increased revenue or growth in our business to offset such costs. Any failure to increase our revenue\nsufficiently to keep pace with our\n12\nTable of Contents\ninvestments and other expenses could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow\non a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.8\nbillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards.\nAdditionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations\nthat arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs.\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\nlosses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain, or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our past revenue growth rate, growth in demand for\nour offerings, and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future performance.\nDuring the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total\nOrders, and Marketplace GOV. In 2020 and 2021, our revenue was $2.9 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively,\nrepresenting a 69% year-over-year growth rate. In 2021 and 2022, our revenue was $4.9 billion and $6.6 billion,\nrespectively, representing a 35% year-over-year growth rate. The circumstances that accelerated the growth of our\nbusiness during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to recur, and we expect growth in consumer demand\nand our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to continue to decline in future periods compared\nto growth rates in 2020 and 2021. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous\nquarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business\nmetrics growth in future periods.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the short term and\ndecline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market adoption. We may also\nexperience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in\nthe number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing competition, a decrease in\nthe growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, and increasing regulatory\ncosts. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may\nnot result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost of such investments. If our revenue growth rate\ndeclines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway (including Grubhub,\nwhich it acquired in June 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online\nordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services,\nconvenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and\nmerchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with large Internet\ncompanies with substantial resources, users, and market and brand power. In addition, we compete with traditional\noffline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to\nconsumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. Further, as we\ncontinue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these\nmarkets.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and suppliers, larger existing user bases, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, established geographic footprints and infrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical,\nand other resources than we have. For example, with grocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains\nthat have strong bargaining power, established relationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater\nfinancial resources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and\nefficiently to new or emerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may\nrender our platform less attractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a\nspecific geographic market, or if merchants\n13\nTable of Contents\nchoose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of merchant options\nor lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing to consumers. Our\ncompetitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic relationships among themselves\nor with others, including merchants. For example, in July 2022, Grubhub announced a partnership with Amazon that\nallows Amazon Prime members in the United States to receive a free trial of Grubhub's membership program. Our\ncompetitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake\nmore aggressive marketing campaigns than ours. Such efforts may lead us to lose category share or require us to\nincrease our marketing expenses in order to maintain our category share.\nIn particular, our acquisition of Wolt and the expansion of the combined company may lead to an increase in\ncompetitive pressure from both existing competitors and new entrants in an already highly competitive industry.\nThrough the acquisition, we have expanded our operations in Europe and Asia — regions that are already subject to\nintense competition in many of the categories in which we operate. As a result, existing competitors and any\nsubsequent entrants in Europe and Asia may engage in aggressive consumer acquisition campaigns, develop superior\nofferings, or consolidate with other entities and achieve benefits of scale in response to our acquisition of Wolt.\nSuch competitive pressures in an already highly competitive market may erode our category share, adversely impact\nour business, and increase the expenses associated with, or otherwise hinder, our expansion in both existing and\nnew markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and\nconsumer fees, greater incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services, consumer discounts and\npromotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, any of which may be more attractive\nthan those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission rates and fees\nor maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions to remain competitive, particularly in markets\nwhere we are not in a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively\naffect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the\nmarkets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we\nanticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the\nother competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees,\nor increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Local\non-demand delivery services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot\nguarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve, maintain or increase\nprofitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost effective to develop their own platforms to\noffer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the\nlowest-cost provider and could use more than one local commerce platform, independent contractors who provide\ndelivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and merchants\ncould prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more than one\nplatform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as existing\nofferings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain of our\nplatform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than ours, which\nwould make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate. Increased competition could result in,\namong other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform\nusers, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow\nour platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in\nnew markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers\nattracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has\ngrown in the past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and\nour national brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to\nincur substantial expenses to acquire\n14\nTable of Contents\nadditional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to acquire additional merchants\nand consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may invest significant resources\nwith the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. We\ncannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of\nacquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by\nproviding us at least seven or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any\nexclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection\navailable on our local commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our\nrelationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other\nconstituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how\ncompelling these offerings are to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership\nproducts. Additionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain\npromotions, such as discounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and\nofferings to such consumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our\nmembership products, through prompts and notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other\nofferings. However, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our\nplatform after they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our\nconsumers to regular paying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform,\ndemand for our full-price or paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than\nexpected or decline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites\nand applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and\napplications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If\nconsumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than\nthrough our websites and consumer mobile applications directly, our ability to establish relationships and build\nbrand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized\nexperience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract\nand retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the ability\nto decline orders or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity provisions\nwith Dashers. Accordingly, if we do not continue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform and compelling\nopportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers or retain existing Dashers or increase their use\nof our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or work stoppages that could adversely affect\nour users and our business. Relatedly, If merchants and consumers choose to use competing offerings, we may lack\nsufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform and impact our\nability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain Dashers, we have, among other things, invested in\nmaking the use of our Dasher applications, and dashing, as frictionless as possible, created new ways for Dashers\nto earn and get paid, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, including credits to be used for orders on our\nplatform, tips and assistance using the Dasher applications, and access to programs that provide cashback rewards\non certain purchases, including gasoline. We also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing\nDashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase\nuse of our platform by existing Dashers or could have other unintended adverse consequences, including negative\npress, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our brand and reputation. Changes in\ncertain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment laws, may result in a decrease in the\npool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and\nengagement. Other factors outside of our control, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or\ninsurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers.\nIf we fail to attract Dashers, retain existing Dashers on favorable terms, or maintain or increase the use of our\nplatform by\n15\nTable of Contents\nexisting Dashers, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely\naffected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these\nmerchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods at affordable prices, meeting\nour requirements and standards, experience problems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, or choose to\nraise the prices of their goods on our platform for any other reason, our reputation and brand could be damaged.\nFurther, an increase in merchant operating costs, or other deterioration in financial condition, whether due to\ninflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or\ncease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. If merchants\non our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide consumers with\nsufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform. Additionally,\nsome items on our platform are listed at higher prices relative to their in-store prices. This practice can\nnegatively affect consumer perception of our platform and could result in a decline in consumers or order volume,\nor both, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses, including in the case of our\nacquisition of Wolt;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nour business mix between our Marketplaces and Platform Services;\nthe contribution to our overall business of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal\npatterns in restaurant dining;\nthe impact of weather on our business;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe contribution to our overall business of our advertising products and services, including the effect that\nmarket conditions may have on our ability to sell these products and services;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\n16\nTable of Contents\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of outbreaks of contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response of governments\nand private industry;\nthe impact of price controls that may be imposed by various jurisdictions, and any associated increase in the\nfees we may have to impose to offset such price controls;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become\nincreasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of\nour platform, especially during peak usage times, as our operations grow and the usage of our platform increases.\nSome of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result\nfrom interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time\nto time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These\nevents have resulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of\nrevenue and may harm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to\nconsumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event,\nincluding for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may\nvoluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse\nfrom us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to\naddress. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the\navailability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and\ncould result in the loss of users.\n17\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nincluding in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets\nand arrangements that complement our business. For example, on May 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Wolt.\nWe have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to evaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent\nmarkets and there is no assurance that such acquired businesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we\nenter into, will be successfully integrated into our business, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits\non a timely basis or at all.\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and\nnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and\nadversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\ndifficulties integrating the technologies, operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts, and\npersonnel of an acquired business;\ndifficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business,\nand difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\ndifficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\nchallenges integrating accounting, finance, and forecasting practices of acquired businesses with our own,\nespecially in the context of international businesses;\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense\nsharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership\ninvestments;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndifficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones,\nlanguages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\ncurrency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with foreign jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment\nopportunities;\nthe need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public\ncompany like ours at companies we may acquire that prior to acquisition may not have robust controls, procedures,\nand policies, in particular, with respect to the effectiveness of internal controls, cyber and information security\npractices, incident response plans, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans, compliance with privacy,\ndata protection, information security, and other regulations, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and\nsanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an investment or acquired\nbusiness, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices,\nlitigation, information security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand management, revenue recognition\nor other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nthe enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our\nability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions\n(such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the\ncompletion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\nan acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our\nexisting business;\n18\nTable of Contents\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction,\nwhich may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\nas a result of an acquisition, third parties we or an acquired business works with may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions, seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired business,\nor consider working with a competitor instead; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our\nresults of operation, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or if\nthe transaction costs are greater than expected.\nIn particular, the ongoing integration of Wolt into our business poses heightened risks, including write-offs or\nrestructuring charges, unanticipated costs, regulatory and compliance risk associated with operating in a number of\nnew jurisdictions, operational difficulties, and the loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that the\nintegration will be accomplished effectively or in a timely manner. In addition, the integration of Wolt will\nsubject us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the completion of the acquisition,\nsome of which may be unknown. Although we and our advisers have conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt\nand we have certain rights of indemnification, including an escrow of acquisition consideration to secure certain\nobligations of Wolt's securityholders, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of Wolt or\nthat the amounts in escrow will be sufficient. Further, the escrow consists of shares and therefore, even if we are\nable to recover from the escrow, we will need to use our cash and resources to pay for the liabilities and damages.\nThese liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition not currently known to us\nor that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, including our profitability.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, in\nOctober 2021, we closed a $395 million investment in preferred shares of a private grocery delivery platform\ncompany based in Europe. Strategic investments inherently involve less control over business operations of the\ninvestee, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks\nassociated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners,\ncontrolling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business\ninterests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions\nor omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them\nmay adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and may\notherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our investments\nmay be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities\nnow or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct\ninvestment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity is subject to regulatory\nreview, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our\nability to carry out our long-term business strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments\nwill generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For\nexample, during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, in the course of evaluating our investments, we determined\nimpairment indicators existed for a previously disclosed investment in a grocery delivery platform company.\nFollowing a valuation of this investment, we incurred an impairment of $312 million associated with our non-\nmarketable equity securities.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets\nand arrangements and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such\nacquisitions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful.\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S.\nmarkets as part of our growth strategy. We launched our platform in Canada in 2015, Australia in 2019, Japan and\nGermany in 2021, and New Zealand in 2022. We continued our expansion in Europe and Asia through our acquisition of\nWolt in 2022, which brings the number of countries that we operate in outside the United States to 26. Our\noperations outside of the United States require significant operating expenses and management attention in order to\noversee operations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural norms, and customs, in addition\nto placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Our current\ninternational operations and\n19\nTable of Contents\nour plans for investment in non-U.S. markets subject us to a number of risks and we may not be successful in our\ninternational operations for a variety of reasons, including:\nan inability to recruit and retain talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintain our company\nculture across all of our offices;\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\ndifficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, Dashers, and consumers in non-U.S.\nmarkets;\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards across jurisdictions, including with respect to labor and\nemployment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export control and sanctions, public health, payment processing,\ntransactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\nincreased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue\nrecognition and similar accounting principles;\ndifficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and\ncustoms, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it\nrelates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\nunique and varying terms and conditions in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\nvarying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security\nrisks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards,\nincluding with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions such as\nU.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, the civil\nunrest in Kazakhstan required Wolt to temporally suspend its business operations in the country due to safety and\nsecurity concerns, as well as the unavailability of, and significant disruptions to, Internet service. While we\nhave been able to resume business operations in Kazakhstan, such events may occur in the future in other countries\nor regions leading to similar disruptions. In addition, Wolt's operations in markets that are in close proximity to\nRussia increases the difficulty in complying with trade and economic sanction regimes related to business with\nRussia.\n20\nTable of Contents\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local commerce platforms will have an adverse\nimpact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, fees and commissions charged by local\ncommerce platforms have been under increased scrutiny and are expected to continue to be subject to political and\npublic debate in the jurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate. Many jurisdictions in which we have\noperations have price control measures in effect on local commerce platforms and we expect other such measures may\nbe enacted in the future. These price controls have caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we\ncharge to consumers. To the extent that price control measures lead to an increase in the fees we charge to\nconsumers, consumer demand for our services could be reduced, which would further harm our business and results of\noperations. Our risks related to price controls are described in more detail under “— Our business is subject to a\nvariety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay, and\nmerchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such\nlaws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations and subject us to legal claims .”\nCertain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings.\nSimilarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract and retain new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be no assurance that we will not be forced, through\ncompetition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we\npay to Dashers that utilize our platform, further reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or increase\nour marketing and other expenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive\npressures. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, including Dasher\nor consumer loyalty programs, such as our membership products like DashPass and Wolt+, or modify existing pricing\nmethodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers and which may result in lower\ncommissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, our consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our business model and\npricing methodologies may not be competitive in these locations. As a result, our continued international expansion\nmay require us to change our operations and pricing strategies to adjust to different cultural norms, including\nwith respect to consumer pricing and gratuities.\nOur assessments about optimal pricing strategy may not be accurate and may not enable us to compete in the\ncategories and regions in which we operate effectively. There may also be errors or defects in the technology we\nuse to set our prices, which could result in underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the services\non our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Any such pricing assumptions,\ntechnological errors or defects in pricing, or changes to our pricing methodology could adversely affect demand for\nour platform, our brand and reputation, and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay models for Dashers.\nOur pay models for Dashers in the United States, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led,\nand may continue to lead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For\nexample, under a former pay model for Dashers in the United States, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on\na delivery in cases when a consumer left little or no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers\nby making every delivery economically worthwhile, it also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be\nunder the misimpression that not all tips were being received by Dashers. Government authorities have brought\nclaims against us related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model and may bring similar claims in the future. For\nexample, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the Superior Court of the District of\nColumbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act with respect to our\nformer DoorDash Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent order and judgment to\nresolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model from other\ngovernment authorities in the future.\nWe have also launched, and may in the future launch, changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that\nutilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers and may result in\nnegative publicity. For example, we increased the amount we pay to DoorDash Dashers per order when we changed our\npay model in September 2019, but this pay model also causes less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some\ncases. Further,\n21\nTable of Contents\nthis pay model has resulted in, and in the future may result in, negative publicity related to perceptions of its\ncomplexity, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips,\nand as a result, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the\nfuture, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes and expansion into new categories and\ngeographies, we may change our Dasher pay models again. Our current Dasher pay models, and any future changes to\nour pay models or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an increase to the\nfees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain consumers, and could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that\nDashers may be reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law or laws of other jurisdictions in which we\noperate. As discussed further elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have been involved in and continue\nto be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification in the United States, and such\nproceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West,\nInc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”), including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June\n2020. Certain risks related to reclassification of Dashers that use our platform are described in more detail under\n“ —If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law , or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate , our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected .” A reclassification of Dashers as employees could require us to revise our pricing\nmethodologies and Dasher pay models to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other\nsubstantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a subset of Dashers to employment positions,\nwhich would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. We have\nexperienced rapid employee headcount growth at our San Francisco headquarters, in a number of our offices across\nthe United States, internationally, and with employees working remotely globally. We have also expanded our\npresence, both in employee headcount and operationally, in Europe and Asia through our acquisition of Wolt. This\ngrowth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial\ninfrastructure.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as a result of our rapid\ngrowth, including at Wolt and other companies we may acquire, could result in errors in our consolidated financial\nstatements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our\nreporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could cause a decline in the price\nof our Class A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure in\norder to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations. Similarly, our failure to\nimplement and maintain effective data and information security systems with respect to our platform as we grow\ncould result in breaches, security incidents, theft or fraud, service disruptions, loss of user confidence in our\nplatform, legal claims, regulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation or brand, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, services, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our\noperational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large\nnumber of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge\nour ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our\nplatform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more\nimportant as competition in\n22\nTable of Contents\nour industry further intensifies. Similarly, maintaining and enhancing the Wolt reputation and brand will be\nparticularly important for our continued growth in Europe and Asia. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and\nenhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the\nsuccess of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our\nability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” and \"Wolt\" marks, our logos,\nand other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our\ncontrol. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform,\nwhich in turn drives new user growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-\neffective. Our users have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local commerce platforms\nand services, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our user base, we must appeal\nto new users who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local commerce platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. The effect\nof negative publicity could be exacerbated to the extent dissatisfaction with, or complaints concerning, us are\ndisseminated via social media, due to its immediacy and accessibility as a means of communication. Any such\nexpressions of dissatisfaction or complaints, even if ultimately concluded to be unfounded or successfully resolved\nwithout direct adverse financial effects, could still harm our brand, reputation, and local network effects.\nNegative perception of our platform or company may result from:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform,\nincluding highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including\nDasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nfraud;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\ntraffic accidents caused by, or involving, Dashers or employee couriers or death or serious injury involving a\nDasher or employee couriers or any party associated with us;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or otherwise pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission, or not clearly articulated;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements, including violations of food\ninformation and alcohol delivery age verification regulations;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant, and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\n23\nTable of Contents\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\nour operations in regions that are or become subject to geopolitical instability, conflict, or economic\nsanctions, and any negative consequences of such operations to us, our merchants, consumers, or Dashers; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but\nnegatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance\nthe interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely\naffect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases, viruses or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, could disrupt our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases, viruses, or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and related mitigation\nefforts have disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our business. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19\npandemic, or any future pandemic or outbreak of disease, on our business will depend on factors that are highly\nuncertain and cannot be predicted, such as the availability of effective vaccines, regulatory actions impacting\nmerchant operations, consumer and merchant pricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings, and changes to consumer\nbehavior or spending patterns.\nWe may also be adversely affected as a result of the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic or any other future outbreak\nof disease could have on our third-party providers and merchants. Merchants may experience temporary closures of\ntheir businesses, supply chain delays, labor shortages, and the unavailability of certain products, which could\ncause merchants to limit their operating hours or cease operations entirely, impact the selection available on our\nplatform, and disrupt our ability to operate. To the extent the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public\nhealth threat has an impact on our business, it is likely to also have the effect of heightening many of the other\nrisks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, Dasher\npay models, user support, technology, platform policies, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues,\nprivacy or security practices, management team, compliance with laws and regulations, or the health and safety of\nDashers, employee couriers, merchants, and consumers using our platform could adversely affect our reputation. Such\nnegative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and loyalty of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which\nDashers were compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general\nfood safety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers, and merchants using our platform,\nwhich has adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to scale and public awareness of\nour brand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an amplified negative effect on our\nreputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands, influencers, or other third parties\nthat we have partnered with or may partner with in the future may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is\nnot directly related to us. Any negative publicity that we may receive could diminish confidence in, and the use\nof, our platform, which could adversely affect our business.\n24\nTable of Contents\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our\nbrand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive\nand proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary\ndata relating to our business, including our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our employees.\nCybersecurity incidents are increasing in severity and sophistication and can originate with external actors or\nwith our employees and contractors, whether acting maliciously or by inadvertently providing access to an external\nparty or having their credentials compromised by an external party. Further, due to the current geopolitical\nenvironment, there is heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents sponsored by state actors, which could target\nbusinesses. These incidents can originate on our vendors’ systems, which can be leveraged to access our websites,\nplatforms, and data, including personal data. We and our vendors have previously experienced these types of\nbreaches and other incidents. For example, in August 2022, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors\nthat resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of certain consumers and Dashers. In addition, in December\n2021, we investigated and patched Log4j vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could have allowed for unauthorized\nremote code execution in our systems. We have undertaken steps to enhance our data security and governance program,\nwhich include adding security layers around data, improving access controls, hiring additional personnel with data\nsecurity experience, and using outside expertise to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all\npotential causes of these incidents have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or other\nincidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and\nmay not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate or\nprevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we and our vendors\nmay face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems used in our\nbusiness through various means, including gaining unauthorized access to the systems of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that use our platform. In addition, there may be attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants,\nconsumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other\nsensitive information resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. With the prevalence of remote\nwork, we may be exposed to increased risks of breaches or incidents via such methods.\nAlthough we have taken measures to protect our systems and the data in our possession, these measures have not\nfully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. Our IT and infrastructure may\nbe vulnerable to viruses, social engineering, vulnerabilities, denial of service, credential stuffing, ransomware\nand other malware, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption, and unauthorized parties may be\nable to access data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data, through those systems.\nAlthough we have policies restricting the access to the personal data we store, these policies may not be effective\nin all cases. Any actual or perceived breach or similar incident could interrupt our operations, harm our\nreputation, brand, and competitive position, result in our platform being unavailable, loss or improper access to,\nor unavailability of, data, fraudulent transfer of funds, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and significant\nlegal, regulatory, and financial exposure. Any such incidents or any perception that our security measures are\ninadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform,\nany of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, any\ncyberattacks or actual or perceived breaches or other incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could\nreduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us.\nAny actual or perceived breach or other security incident, impacting any entities with which we share or disclose\ndata (including, for example, our vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security\nmeasures is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot\nguarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects,\nbugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other disruption to, our or our vendors’\nsystems.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. While we maintain cyber insurance that may help provide coverage\nfor these types of incidents and resulting claims, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be\nadequate for liabilities incurred relating to any breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be available\nto us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future\nclaim. The successful assertion of any claim against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or changes in\nour insurance policies, including premium increases\n25\nTable of Contents\nor the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation,\nbrand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe on-demand local commerce category is still in relatively early stages of growth, and if this category does not\ncontinue to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nThe on-demand local commerce category has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is still\nrelatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. The markets\nfor certain services we facilitate, in particular convenience, grocery, advertising, and certain other categories,\nmay be in even earlier stages of development than our restaurant category, and it is uncertain whether demand for\nthese services will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance, if at all. In addition, through our\nacquisition of Wolt, we have entered many geographies where the development of the on-demand local commerce\ncategory may be at different stages of market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the\nwillingness of people to widely adopt on-demand local commerce platforms. Changing traditional ordering habits is\ndifficult, and if merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to on-demand local commerce platforms as we\nexpect, including as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a\nresult of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead adopt alternative\nsolutions that may arise, then the market for our platform may not further develop or may develop slower than we\nexpect, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may negatively impact our short-term financial results when we believe that the decisions are\nconsistent with our goals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results\nover the long term. These decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and\nmay not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers, have\noccurred, and in the future may occur, which could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. These activities include food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation,\nhandling, or delivery, including the use of unsafe or inappropriate delivery equipment, assault, battery, theft,\nunauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering Dasher\naccounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such activities\nmay result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business\ninterruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to\nbackground checks, fraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, attempted payments\nby consumers with insufficient funds, exploitation of system bugs or vulnerabilities to circumvent payment\nrequirements, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers of Dasher accounts by bad\nactors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal\ninformation, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information, or payment information and\nunauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information, and mobile phone\nnumbers. For example, bad actors have created Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal identifying\ninformation to commit fraud on our platform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, in the United\nStates, this has caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as\nDashers. We have launched a series of initiatives and product changes to help prevent these practices, but there\ncan be no assurances that our efforts will be successful in fully remediating this or similar issues.\n26\nTable of Contents\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit\ncard data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we\nhave taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot\nguarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to\nadequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nillegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, these measures may\nnot adequately address or prevent all such activity from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability,\nincluding through litigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we\nhave deactivated from our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform\ndeliveries. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check where permitted by\napplicable law, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from\nusing our platform, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are\nperceived to have failed to do so, or if our competitors do not adopt similar measures, the growth and engagement\nof the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which enables merchants on our\nMarketplaces to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are retained directly by\nmerchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in any of the other\nactivities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on our platform. Any negative publicity\nrelated to incidents involving illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, or the measures we adopt\nto mitigate the risk of such incidents, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our competitors’\nplatforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a whole, which\ncould negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which sometimes includes facilitating deliveries to\nconsumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less\noperationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner\nmerchants’ systems. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order and a higher\nlikelihood of errors. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with\nfacilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nSome non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. There is a\nrisk that non-partner merchants will bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. For\nexample, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair competition, among other claims, and\nsought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. In addition, measures have been enacted in\nmany U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit, among other things, on-demand local commerce platforms like ours from\nfacilitating deliveries from restaurants without the restaurants’ prior consent. We have adopted internal policies\npursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our platform in the United\nStates and require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner restaurants on our platform in the United\nStates to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with us. However, we continue to add non-partner\nmerchants in categories other than restaurants. In the future, we may continue to revise and update our internal\npolicies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we are required or we choose to\nremove non-partner merchants for any reason, this may adversely affect our ability to provide a broad selection of\nmerchants on our platform, attract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsites and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail\nto expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance\nand\n27\nTable of Contents\nimprove our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely affected. To\ncompete effectively, we must also provide a convenient, efficient, and reliable consumer experience on our\nplatform, and we may be unable to effectively address consumer needs or identify emerging consumer trends. If\ncompetitors introduce new features, offerings, or technologies, or if new industry standards and practices or\nconsumer trends emerge, our existing technology, services, websites, and mobile applications may become less\npopular or obsolete. For example, our competitors may develop and commercialize autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies at scale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone\ndelivery to market before we do, or their technology is, or is perceived to be, superior to our or our partners’\ntechnology, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success could depend on our ability\nto invest in, develop, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a\ncost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to, and new services on, our platform may involve significant technical risks, the time and\nattention of our personnel, including management and key employees, and upfront capital investments that may not\ngenerate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging\nindustry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features and services or if\nour recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nWe face certain risks with our convenience, grocery, and other retail operations in connection with our self-\noperated convenience and grocery stores.\nWe face certain risks in connection with the operation of DashMart and Wolt Market, our first-party owned and self-\noperated convenience and grocery delivery businesses. To build and expand DashMart and Wolt Market, we have made\nsubstantial investments, including in establishing and managing a reliable supply chain for groceries, including\nthe maintenance of a cold chain to ensure food safety and hygiene, establishing supply-related contractual\npartnerships, inventory management, leasing premises, hiring personnel, and rolling out relevant technologies and\nprocesses. We also plan to continue to invest in such businesses in the future. The maintenance and expansion of\nour DashMart and Wolt Market businesses requires significant investments, and there is no assurance that we will\nrealize any of the anticipated benefits. In locations where we operate DashMart and Wolt Market, we may not be able\nto generate a sufficient number of orders to make such services viable in certain locations and we may incur\nsignificant costs before we can determine the viability of these DashMart and Wolt Market locations. Our self-\noperated retail locations also expose us to different regulatory requirements and risks than our Marketplaces and\nPlatform Services, in particular with respect to food safety, alcoholic beverage licenses, and zoning restrictions.\nOur expansion into convenience, grocery, and other retail categories, may also result in the diversion of\nmanagement’s attention from other business opportunities as well as the diversion of resources from support\nfunctions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may\nbe difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset\nthe additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,\nwe expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the resulting gains in\nefficiency to our platform that\n28\nTable of Contents\nwe expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business and subject to a number of risks,\nincluding changes to our Dasher pay models and changes in macroeconomic conditions. The cost effectiveness of our\nplatform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do not reduce the\nnumber of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are unable to\nmaintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher\npay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nnot only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of non-U.S. based\nusers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with\ndelivering support in languages other than English and in ways consistent with the customs and dominant\ntechnologies used in the various geographies in which we operate. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or\na market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect\nour ability to scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending habits and Dasher behavior patterns, each of which have a\nsignificant impact on our growth and expenses. We may experience changes in consumer activity over the course of\nthe calendar year, although our rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to\nmake, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity may be impacted by weather. Colder\nor more inclement weather may increase consumer demand, while warmer or sunny weather may decrease consumer demand.\nIn contrast, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of cold or inclement weather, during times\nwhen we need more Dashers available to fulfill orders driven by increased consumer demand. In such instances, we\ntypically rely on incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which\nincreases our costs. Further, severe weather can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, making it\nimpossible for Dashers to fulfill deliveries. We also benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets\nwhen school is in session, and we experience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during\nsummer breaks and other vacation periods, causing a decrease in Dasher pay and adverse effects to our results of\noperations during impacted periods. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a\nquarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience\nmay become more pronounced and contribute to greater fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to\nscale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations and we may not be\nable to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, causing our results of operations\nto fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to variable global economic conditions in the regions in which we do business and their\nimpact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors that may impact consumer spending on our platform\ninclude general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, fluctuations in household net worth, inflation\ngenerally, fluctuations in gasoline, vehicle, and transportation costs, increased food costs, fluctuations in\ncommodity prices, declines in asset prices, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices,\nchanges in interest rates and credit availability, consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the current and\nfuture political and economic environment, and other macroeconomic factors. Economic conditions in certain regions\nmay also be affected or exacerbated by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats\nto public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nConsumer purchases, particularly of discretionary items, may decline during recessions and other periods in which\ndisposable income is adversely affected, periods of economic uncertainty, or when there is a loss of consumer\nconfidence in the economy. Consumers may choose to reduce their spending on our platform or forego spending on our\nplatform\n29\nTable of Contents\naltogether. Further, because spending on our platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that\nany decline in consumer spending would have a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses\nthat sell products or services considered to be necessities. If spending on our platform declines, or grows at a\nslower rate, including as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages and supply chain issues at merchants could negatively\nimpact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplaces and in our Drive\nbusiness. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact consumer demand\nand drive lower order volume on our Marketplaces and in our Drive business. Small businesses that do not have\nsubstantial resources, like many of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor\neconomic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform, including our small business merchants,\ncease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not\nbe able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform.\nAs our business has grown, including in connection with our acquisition of Wolt, we have increasingly become\nsubject to risks arising from adverse global economic and political conditions, including Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine. While our business does not operate in Russia or Ukraine, we have operations in countries that border\nRussia and Ukraine and are exposed to the economic impacts of that conflict on the region. Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions in the region and give\nrise to volatility and instability in a manner that adversely affects our business and merchants, consumers, and\nDashers on our platform. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could also negatively impact consumer confidence and spending\nglobally and in the neighboring countries in which we operate, disrupt supply chains, and drive inflationary cost\nincreases for labor, fuel, materials, food, and services, all of which may negatively impact our business.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new geographic markets and categories in which we have\nlimited or no prior operating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new geographic markets and categories. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately\npredict consumer preferences and purchasing habits in these new geographic markets and categories. In addition,\neach market and category has unique regulatory dynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or\nindirectly affect our ability to operate, the pool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with\ninsurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new Dashers. In addition, each market and category is subject to distinct\ncompetitive and operational dynamics. These include our ability to offer more attractive services than alternative\noptions and our ability to efficiently attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect\nour sales, results of operations, and key business metrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our\nresults of operations due to the changing dynamics in the geographic markets and categories in which we operate. If\nwe invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are unable to manage these risks effectively,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. For more information on\nrisks associated with entry into new markets internationally see the section titled “— Our international operations\nand any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be\nsuccessful. ” For more information on risks associated with the entry into new categories see the section titled “—\nWe face certain risks in expanding our convenience, grocery, and other retail operations, especially in connection\nwith our self-operated convenience and grocery stores .”\nWe are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our operations in foreign countries. When\nconducting business in foreign countries, including through Wolt and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nbusiness is typically denominated in the local currency of the respective country. Our most significant foreign\ncurrency exposure is currently to the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel, the Australian dollar, and the\nJapanese yen. Because our financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, local currencies will be converted\ninto U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements, thereby\nincreasing the foreign exchange translation risk.\n30\nTable of Contents\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our\nbusiness. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our\nemployees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public\nmarkets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of\ncash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit,\ntrain, and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\nan increasing share of our workforce working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and spending less time collaborating\nin offices;\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions, including in the case of our acquisition of\nWolt;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; and\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management.\nAny of the foregoing factors may be further exacerbated as a result of the reduction in workforce that was\ndisclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K on December 1, 2022. If we are not able to maintain and evolve our\nculture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal,\naccounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and\nplace significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations. We also need to implement, integrate, and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting at companies we acquire, including in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, and any failure\nto do so could impact our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports\nregarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\nexcessive number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return\nto our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not\neffectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and\nnetwork architecture to accommodate actual and\n32\nTable of Contents\nanticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity and a loss of users, revenue, and\navailability of our platform, as well as other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by\nmalicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach\nor other security incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze,\ncorrect, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to\ntimely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business,\nreputation, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting and/or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will\nresult in dilution to our stockholders. We also permit certain RSU holders to elect to cover the RSU tax\nwithholding liabilities by providing to us a cash payment amount.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs, we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued\nwith respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations, (ii) have\nthe holders of such RSUs use a broker to sell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement\ndate, with the proceeds of such sales to be delivered to us for remittance to the relevant taxing authorities, in\norder to satisfy such tax withholding and remittance obligations, which is generally referred to as \"sell-to-\ncover,\" or (iii) allow certain holders of such RSUs to pay us an amount in cash, via a broker, sufficient to cover\nthe applicable RSU tax withholding obligations. If we withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would\notherwise be issued with respect to the vesting and/or settlement of RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in\ncash to satisfy such tax obligations, this may result in significant cash expenditures by us. We have implemented\n“sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, pursuant to which shares with a market value equivalent to\nthe tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover\nthe tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the taxing authorities.\nSuch sales or any cash amount that the holder provides to us to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding\nobligations, in either case, will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the tax\nwithholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number of\nshares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts, key business and non-\nGAAP metrics, such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted\nGross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, and certain other metrics required\nby regulatory and administrative bodies, such as the monthly active recipients of our services in the EU (as\nrequired by Article 24(2) of the Digital Services Act), with internal systems and tools that are not independently\nverified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due\nto differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have\na number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result\nin unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools\nwe use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors,\nthe data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our\nplatform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics could be impacted by\nfraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even\nthough this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and prevent this behavior.\nConsumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our platform. In addition,\nlimitations or errors with respect to how we measure data\n33\nTable of Contents\nor with respect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which\ncould affect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business,\nif investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with\nrespect to these figures, investors may lose confidence in our operating metrics and business and we expect that we\ncould be subject to legal claims, including securities class action lawsuits, and our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions\nand insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive\nmodeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial\nprojections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently\nrepresented in the historical data or which are not yet quantifiable. A number of external factors can affect the\nactual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open,\nfluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected\nevents such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such factors can impact the\nreserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves\nfor claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. For\nany of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial statements. If we determine that our\nestimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the\ndetermination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined\nand negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.\nIn addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations\nof the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\nother things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public\ncompany, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract\nmanagement, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a\nresult of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition\nwill become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our\nmanagement team may not successfully or efficiently manage our operations as a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the continuous\nscrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant\nattention from our senior\n34\nTable of Contents\nmanagement and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our business, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in\njurisdictions in Europe and Asia, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as\nindependent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an independent contractor or an employee vary by\ngoverning law and are typically highly fact intensive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and\nclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various\nauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and\nconsumers that use our platform. For example, in October 2022, the U.S Department of Labor released a proposed rule\nregarding the classification of employees and independent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act.\nThe proposed rule would implement new interpretative guidance for classification of workers. We maintain that\nDashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors. However, Dashers may be\nreclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on worker classification and\ntheir potential impact on the local commerce industry. A reclassification of Dashers as employees would adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly\nalter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability to add and retain Dashers to our platform\nand grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in\nDynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for\nexample, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. For more details on this\naction, please see the section titled \" Legal Proceedings \" above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSome jurisdictions in the United States, Europe, and Asia have modified, or are considering modifying, their\nstandards used to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill\n(\"AB 5\") and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January\n1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and\ncreated numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for Proposition 22\n(“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was approved by voters in\nNovember 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court\nin California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney\nGeneral and other groups and individuals\n35\nTable of Contents\nappealed to the California Court of Appeal. To the extent Proposition 22 remains in effect, certain provisions\nregarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California.\nThese provisions have increased our costs related to Dashers in California. To offset a portion of these increased\ncosts, in certain circumstances we charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes\nover time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs\ncould also lead to a lower Net Revenue Margin, which we referred to in past SEC filings as Take Rate, defined as\nrevenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now\napplicable to us include, but are not limited to, (i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other\namounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings floor equal to (A) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged\ntime and (B) for Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for\ninflation in future years) and (ii) for Dashers averaging at least 15 hours per week of engaged time during a\ncalendar quarter who subscribe to a qualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of\nvarying dollar amounts depending on a Dasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 has had, and may\ncontinue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may propose or support\nlegislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, that would pair worker flexibility and\nindependence with new protections and benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we\npropose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, we would expect our costs\nrelated to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such\njurisdictions if it becomes necessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would\nadversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such\ninitiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs\nfiled a claim in California Superior Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in\nthe Alameda County Superior Court’s order finding the entirety of Proposition 22 unenforceable. If Dashers are\ndetermined to be employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate,\nincluding as a result of litigation, this could result in increases to our costs related to Dashers, which would\nlikely lead us to increase fees and commissions and may result in lower order volumes, which in turn would have an\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. For example, on November 1, 2021, the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration (through\nthe Division at the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland) issued a decision which deemed that\nWolt courier partners in Finland are in an employment relationship with Wolt, and that Wolt should be mandated to\nkeep statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. We have appealed the decision to the Administrative\nCourt of Hämeenlinna. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing the standards used to determine\nworker classification, which may impact our classification of Dashers using our platform. For example, the EU is\nconsidering new criteria for determining worker classification, which could be adopted by member states. Any\npotential EU-wide legislative reform may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent contractor\nmodel within the EU.\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, we may\ndecide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result in certain operational\nchallenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain jurisdictions or decide not to expand our\nbusiness in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion opportunities.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result.\nWe face potential liability, legal expenses, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business\ngenerally, and with the delivery services we facilitate in particular. Specifically, we are subject to claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal, regulatory, and other administrative\nproceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker classification, labor and\nemployment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints, intellectual property\ndisputes, marketing and advertising to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, compliance with regulatory requirements,\nand other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations,\nand legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by merchants and\n36\nTable of Contents\nDashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we sometimes\nchoose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the uncertainty of\nlitigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we face increasing\npublic scrutiny. Similarly, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages or\nalcohol consumption. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any\nconsumers, Dashers, employees, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand,\nreputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to threatened and\nactual legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could\ndo so in the future as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our\nplatform that generate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our\nbusiness. The potential for acts of terrorism on the United States or international food supply also exists and, if\nsuch an event occurs, it could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through\nour platform could be subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a\nfood recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our\nplatform, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to Dasher\nearnings, sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher,\nincluding our background check processes, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email,\ntext, or telephone. We also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers\nrelating to, among other things, our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect\nto sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the local food delivery fulfillment services we\nfacilitate, discrepancies between the menus on our websites and consumer mobile applications and the menus at the\nrestaurant from which the food is delivered, including discrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and\ntaxes on such items, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or\ntelephone. In addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other\nrepresentative actions, by or relating to merchants regarding, among other things, menu pricing, exclusivity\narrangements, and the listing of merchants on our platform without an agreement.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our\nwebsites and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and\nnegligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security\nincident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our\nnotification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or\nregulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious\nor not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such\nproceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. There can be no\nguarantee that our litigation reserves will be sufficient to offset such liabilities. These proceedings could also\nresult in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders requiring a\nchange in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal\nobligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and current\nand former directors and officers.\nIn the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, we include arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform.\nThese provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some\ncases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in court. However, arbitration can be costly and\nburdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our\nreputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize\nthese risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of\n37\nTable of Contents\narbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either\nof which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our\nplatform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between U.S. state and federal law, there is a risk that some\nor all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or\nin part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our\nbusiness or to local commerce platforms generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions\nabout tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes and digital\nservices taxes. Such taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and gross receipt\ntaxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as Canada, Australia, and several\ncountries in Europe and Asia, and we may face various indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise\nquestions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require\nus to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest,\nincluding tax on the cost of goods sold, and could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by\none or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to\ncollect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate\nauthorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally, if merchants\ntry to pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline. Although we\nhave reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our consolidated financial statements, if\nthese liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nUnder U.S. state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain\nstates. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and to the cost of goods, fees, or other\nitems charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, or other\ntaxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and\nadditional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our platform. Any\nof the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing\nauthorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\ncollect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related\nlegislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. , certain states have enacted\nlaws that require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on certain online sales. Requiring tax reporting or\ncollection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. These laws could\nrequire us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including\n38\nTable of Contents\ncosts associated with tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our\nofferings less attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in substantial financial liability and other consequences to us if we were\nunable to remedy such failures in a timely manner.\nFurther, we have several subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with local transfer pricing rules and regulations,\nand failure to comply with such rules could adversely affect our financial condition. Transfer pricing rules\ngenerally require pricing on intra-group transactions to meet an arm's-length standard, which is inherently\nsubjective and subject to challenge. Additionally, these rules generally require documentation substantiating the\nappropriateness of such pricing, which may vary based on the jurisdiction. As a result, we may be exposed to\ntransfer pricing risks, as governmental authorities may challenge our compliance with these rules.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our consolidated financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of\noperations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax\noutcome is determined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\ncertain non-deductible expenses, and the realization of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate\nwould reduce profitability or increase losses. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any\nchanges in the United States or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate\nand harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, income earned by us and our subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction, such as\nin the jurisdiction we or the applicable subsidiary is incorporated or organized, as well as the jurisdiction from\nwhich such income is derived. This may result in double taxation if relief is not available under applicable U.S.\nor non-U.S. law or an applicable tax treaty. Any double taxation may impact the financial results of our\noperations.\nFederal, state, local, and foreign governments may amend existing taxation laws or enact new taxation legislation\napplicable to our business activities, including but not limited to legislation adopting the Pillar One and Pillar\nTwo agreements of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”). These changes in legislation\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and\nforeign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. In addition, the application of\nfederal, state, local, and foreign taxation laws to our business is novel and evolving, and new judicial or\nadministrative interpretations of these laws may increase our tax exposure. While we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no\nassurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority or judicial body would not\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to\nemployment taxes and sales taxes are described in more detail under “ —If Dashers that utilize our platform are\nreclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected ” and “ —Taxing\nauthorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ”\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accumulated $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion of U.S. federal and state net operating\nloss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"), respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to\nexpire in 2036 for U.S. federal and 2024 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate\nsufficient taxable income in time to use these NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and\nSection 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of\n39\nTable of Contents\n1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use\nits pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income may be\nlimited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5\npercent stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply\nunder state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D credit carryforwards, to\nreduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership\nchanges and ownership changes that may occur in the future. Prior to the utilization of NOLs in the future, we will\ndetermine whether there are any limitations under Section 382 of the Code. In addition, we have accumulated $692\nmillion of foreign net operating losses, which may be available to reduce future taxable income in the relevant\njurisdiction. Some of these foreign NOLs will begin to expire in 2025 and it is possible that we may never realize\nthe benefits of these losses.\nThere is also a risk that due to changes in applicable law or regulatory changes (such as suspensions on the use of\nNOLs and other tax attributes by certain jurisdictions, possibly with retroactive effect) or other unforeseen\nreasons, our existing NOLs and other tax attributes could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and\nother tax attributes.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, insurance, and merchant pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and\nstandards governing issues such as worker classification or our relationship with Dashers more generally (for\nexample, those concerning Dasher pay and insurance requirements), labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food\nsafety, alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products, online credit card payments, gratuities, merchant\npricing and commissions, text messaging, membership products, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data\nsharing, data security, consumer protection, background checks, website and mobile application accessibility, and\ntax and other government-imposed fees are often complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations,\nin many cases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are\napplicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations\nbetween U.S. law and the laws of other countries, U.S. state and federal law, between individual states, and even\nat the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time\nthrough judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,\nsuch as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have been proactively working with national, federal,\nstate, and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available broadly in the United\nStates and foreign jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how existing laws would be applied to our business and\nthe new laws to which it may become subject.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their\nusers and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion\nof privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on\nthe nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,\nregulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative\nand regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business.\nFurther, we are subject to regulatory review, proceedings, and audits pursuant to national, federal, state, and\nlocal laws regulating the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products, such as\nproducts containing Cannabidiol (CBD). These regulations and laws dictate matters such as licensing requirements,\nadvertising restrictions, and consumer age verification. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our\noperations resulting from the enforcement of these existing regulations, any changes to existing regulations or\nchanges to the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, or the adoption of any new legislation or\nregulations could result in penalties or cause us to have to suspend sales and delivery of alcoholic beverages or\nother highly regulated products in a jurisdiction for a period of time or result in increased production, sales or\nmarketing costs, or changes to our business practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our brand,\nreputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, particularly\nfollowing our acquisition of Wolt, we have become subject to a growing array laws and regulations, which increase\nthe complexity and compliance risk inherent in our business. For example, the EU recently enacted various\nregulations that govern digital services and markets and impose environmental sustainability obligations and\ndisclosure requirements on businesses like\n40\nTable of Contents\nours. In particular, in November 2022, the Digital Services Act entered into force in the EU and includes new\nobligations to limit the spread of illegal content and illegal products online, increase the protection of minors,\nand provide users with more choice and transparency. The impact of these new regulations on the overall industry,\nbusiness models, and our operations is uncertain. We may be required to enhance our disclosures and undertake\ncertain changes to our products, services, fees and commissions structure, and operations as a result of these new\nrequirements. Furthermore, we could be subject to administrative costs, regulatory proceedings, and fines, any of\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, competition authorities in some of the markets in which Wolt operates have made queries regarding, or\ninvestigated, Wolt’s pricing-related terms or other practices and decisions have been issued by competition\nauthorities and courts concerning Wolt’s pricing-related terms and practices. Any violation of competition laws\ncould result in restraints in the way in which we operate our business. We could also be subject to claims of\nviolations of competition laws in other aspects of our business, such as alleged market sharing, price fixing, or\nexchange of competitively sensitive information. Any potential violations of competition laws could result in\nfines, render applicable pricing-related provisions or contracts unenforceable, require contractual amendments, and\nlead to claims for damages and reputational harm, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with laws and regulations across the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate and to\npredict and adapt to changes in these laws is critical to our success, particularly for our continued expansion\nefforts, which may include entries into new geographic markets or new verticals in existing or new geographic\nmarkets. Additional regulatory scrutiny or changes in legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs\nand make it uneconomical for us to continue to operate in all of our current markets or to continue with our\nexpansion plans, particularly if regulations or their interpretations vary greatly or conflict between different\noperating countries. This may adversely affect our business and financial condition by preventing us from reaching\nsufficient scale in particular markets or having to change our business model or incur additional costs. Our\ninability, or perceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead to additional\nregulatory scrutiny, which could result in administrative or enforcement actions, such as fines, penalties, or\nenforceable undertakings.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,\ntechnology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and\nadministrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they\nmay view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to\nour business, including by changing employment-related laws, requiring businesses like ours to maintain specific\nauto insurance coverage, or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses like ours agree to with merchants\nor the fees that we may charge consumers. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have price control measures in\neffect on local commerce platforms and we expect other such measures may be enacted in the future. These price\ncontrols have had in the past, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These\nprice controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers. To\nthe extent that price control measures lead to an increase in the fees we charge to consumers, consumer demand for\nour services could be reduced, which would further harm our business and results of operations. In addition,\ncertain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or collect such increased consumer fees on our\nplatform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as confusing and/or misleading to consumers.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses or other organizations\nthat perceive our business model negatively to raise their concerns to policymakers and regulators. These\nbusinesses and their trade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant\nresources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market\npresence in an effort to change such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede\nour business and the ability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply\nwith these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that we may not be able to anticipate at\nthis time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to\nthis liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain services or platform\nfeatures, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations\ncould also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and\ncivil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased\nattention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely affect\nour reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred to prevent or mitigate this\npotential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n41\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and\nregulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad, including EU anti-money laundering directives and related regulations in connection with our\noperations in Europe. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and\nour employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. These laws may also hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. In addition, we may be subject to liability, including penalties and fines, for any failure to\nsatisfy certain requirements under anti-money laundering laws, such as meeting local “know your customer” and\nongoing due diligence standards. For example, in connection with our operations in Europe, we could be liable for\npenalties of up to 10% of our revenue in a fiscal year in the event that our anti-money laundering compliance\nmeasures are found to be insufficient. All of these laws may also require that we keep accurate books and records\nand maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have\npolicies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents\nwill not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held\nresponsible, and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands, including\nas a result of our acquisition of Wolt, and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Any\nviolation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could\nresult in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees,\nloss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government\ncontracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse\nconsequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various regulations relating to payment processing.\nThe majority of payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment\nservices, which subjects us to certain payment-related regulations. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. In the United States, money transmitters are\nregulated by numerous state and local governments and agencies, many of which may define money transmitter\ndifferently. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulations and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties levied by national, federal, state,\nor local regulators in one or more jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services. For example, as a result of our\noperations in Europe, we are subject to the revised EU Payment Services Directive (\"PSD II\") and related\nregulations. One of our subsidiaries acts as an intra-group licensed payment service provider for its payment\nservices to merchants in European Economic Area (\"EEA\") countries and has obtained a payment institution license\nfrom the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with PSD II. Should our payment institution license\nbe revoked in the future, or any other enforcement measures be taken by the Finnish Financial Supervisory\nAuthority, such as imposing penalties or forcing us to cease offering certain payment facilities, our operations in\nEurope would be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we expand into new jurisdictions, the payment-related\nregulations that we are subject to will expand as well. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with\napplicable rules and regulations related to payment processing could include criminal and civil proceedings,\nforfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make significant\nchanges to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny, which could interrupt\nour ability to operate in certain jurisdiction and otherwise adversely effect our business and results of\noperations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\nInternet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or\nchanges thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and\nincrease the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance\ncosts or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation,\ntariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution, social media\nmarketing, advertising\n42\nTable of Contents\npractices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband\nresidential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws\ngoverning issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the\nInternet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally, it is possible that foreign\ngovernment entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or websites or may even attempt\nto block access to our mobile applications and websites. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with\nany of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand, a loss in business, and\nproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the users on our platform, as well as\nother personal data relating to individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal,\nnational, and international laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use,\ndisclosure, and protection of certain types of data and require the notification of certain security breaches\ninvolving personal data. These laws and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change\nthrough new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, or changes in enforcement, and such changes may be\ninconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any changes in these laws or regulations could add further\ncomplexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and legal risk; require additional investment of resources in\ncompliance and data management programs; and result in changes or increased compliance costs in business practices\nand policies. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in our efforts to comply with\ncurrent and evolving privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols imposed by law,\nregulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations.\nApplicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property and the personal data of our\nusers. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law effective in December 2021 that would require us to\nprovide consumer data, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and delivery addresses to restaurant\nmerchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a consumer opts out. This could result in consumers\nreceiving unsolicited communications from merchants, which could lead to a negative consumer experience. We have\nfiled a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the\npendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect\non our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand.\nWe are increasingly subject to additional laws relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity as we expand\nour international operations. For example, with our acquisition of Wolt, we expanded our liability under the EU’s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which imposes strict requirements relating to the processing of\npersonal data as well as significant penalties, such as fines, injunctions against the processing of personal data,\nand civil litigation claims for noncompliance.\nWe rely on legal mechanisms for transferring personal data subject to GDPR. In 2020, the EU-US Privacy Shield\nFramework was invalidated in the Schrems II case by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which has created\nsignificant challenges in using other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data from the EEA to other\ncountries. The uncertainty around data transfers and global trends relating to national data localization could\npresent risks with respect to non-compliance, as well as increased costs to comply with complex and evolving\nrequirements.\nWe are also subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be contractually\nrequired to process and secure data in certain manners and to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the\ncosts or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations relating to privacy,\ndata protection, information security, or consumer protection.\nAdditionally, our success depends, in part, on our ability to access, collect, and use data relating to Dashers,\nmerchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as “cookies,” is further\nrestricted, regulated, or blocked by new laws, regulations, and other practices, the amount or accuracy of Internet\nuser information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations that\nsignificantly restrict the practice of online tracking. Other regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the use of\nonline tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem.\nMoreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers, such as Apple and Google, plan to or have\nimplemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block\n43\nTable of Contents\ntracking technologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely\nadopted, significantly reduce the effectiveness of such practices and technologies. As a result, we may have to\ndevelop alternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently\nmarket to them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law and regulations or our practices\nand platform could be inconsistent with, be alleged to fail, or fail to meet all requirements of, such laws,\nregulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors, merchants, or Dashers on our platform, to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or\ncybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal\ndata or other data relating to merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other individuals, or the perception of privacy\nconcerns or that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation and\nbrand, discourage new and existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers from using our platform, or result in fines,\ninvestigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to legal claims resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to certain risks, including liabilities or\nclaims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of automated\nSMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil claims against\nus. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are\ncontinuously evolving and developing. If we are not able to comply with these laws and regulations, including the\nTCPA, in an effective manner, we could be subject to legal claims and liability, our brand and reputation may be\nharmed, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") is subject to interpretation by\nthe Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\"), the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and\ninterpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a\nsignificant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the reporting of transactions completed\nbefore the announcement of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\nNo. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers (Topic 606)” (“ASC 606”), which superseded nearly all existing\nrevenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC\n842”), which increases lease transparency and comparability among organizations. It is difficult to predict the\nimpact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect\nour reported results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance\nproviders are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-\nrelated risks including auto liability, employment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business\ninterruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident\nliability for Dashers, and general business liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or risks\nrelated to our new and evolving services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. Even if\nwe do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services, we may\nnot obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured\nretentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it\nwould be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. In addition, if any of our insurance providers\nterminate their relationship with us or refuse to renew their relationships with us on commercially reasonable\nterms, we would be required to find alternate insurance providers and may not be able to secure similar terms or a\nsuitable replacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we\nprocure certain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in\nviolation of the terms of these merchant agreements and could be subject to additional liabilities as a result.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-\ninsured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and\ndeductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could\nincrease substantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are\nrenewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if\n(i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and\ncoverage limits, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to\npay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of\nclaims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”),\na third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We do not have control\nover the operations of the AWS facilities that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption\nfrom natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of\nmisconduct. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will continue to experience, interruptions,\ndelays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including\ninfrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In\naddition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users on\nour platform. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand. Since our\nplatform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system\nfailures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform, usage of our platform, lead to loss of revenue, increase\nour costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur primary commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate\nthe agreement for convenience by providing us at least 30 days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the\nagreement for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a\n30-day cure period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice.\nAlthough it would be difficult for a number of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more\nalternative cloud infrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms if it became necessary. In the event\nthat our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may\nexperience significant costs or downtime for a short period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of,\nnew cloud infrastructure service providers. However, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of,\nnew cloud infrastructure service providers would cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations over the longer term.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily PayPal and\nStripe. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our\nrelationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to\nrenew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment\nprocessors and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame.\nFurther, the software and services provided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations,\nmay contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could\ncause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information,\nor make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of\ntime, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and\nadversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, anti-money laundering,\nand similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors, we may be subject\nto claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher\ntransaction fees and\n45\nTable of Contents\nmay lose the ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our platform\nless convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely on data provided by Stripe and other payment service\nprovider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in such data.\nIf any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected. Additionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card\nnetwork operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks\ncould adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from\nproviding certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with\nthese rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept\ncredit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our\nthird-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks\nif we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal\nand/or driving records of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those that are\nnot qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be\nadversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the\nrequirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to\nfind an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable\ntime frame. In certain jurisdictions, including the United States, we rely on a single third-party background check\nprovider. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not\nbe able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential\nDashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background\nchecks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our\nexpectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we may be\nunable to adequately protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified Dashers\nmay be inadvertently excluded from our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation and\nbrand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In\naddition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we\nmay not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our\nplatform.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related to notice\nrequirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in\ncertain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct\nsuch background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By\nchoosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the\ndistribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the\nmapping\n46\nTable of Contents\nfunction that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all mapping\nfunctions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions\nmay not be reliable. Any failure by us to understand and manage our exposure to the risks associated with the use\nof third party software, such as the risk of misuse of confidential or proprietary information or the exposure to\ncybersecurity incidents, could adversely impact us. For example, integration issues could prevent the onboarding of\nnew third party software providers or lead to the loss of existing providers. Furthermore, updates to third party\nsoftware that integrates with our offerings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as it previously\nhad or at all. Any changes in these systems that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential\ntreatment to competitive services may impose could adversely affect usage of our platform. From time to time we\nhave had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of our third-party software providers. If, in\nconnection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its relationship with us or otherwise limits the\nprovision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our platform could be disrupted. If the third\nparties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Dashers use, whether in\nconnection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be\nattractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required\nto seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at\nall, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not\ncontrol.\nWe have integrations with PayPal, Stripe, Twilio, Olo, Google Maps, AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-\nparty applications, products, and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify\nour platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition,\nsome of our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our\nplatform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms\non which we, operate and distribute our platform. As our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of\ncompetition we face to increase. Should any of our competitors or merchants on our platform modify their\ntechnologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform\nor is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our\nplatform, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within\nsuch application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that\nreduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could\ndecline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If\nsuch mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications\navailable to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications,\ngive preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose\nterms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us,\nor if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than\nthe placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms\nwill continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these\ndevices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed\nto work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful\nin developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’\nexperience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or\nusing our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating\nsystems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, Apple has imposed new requirements\nfor consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and has implemented a new application tracking transparency\n47\nTable of Contents\nframework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google announced it planned\nto adopt restrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes have, and we expect that\nthese changes will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions. If we are\nunable to mitigate the effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as\nwell as order rates from existing consumers on our platform.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear\nprominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search\nengines like Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to\nhow and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors,\nmany of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change\nits ranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may\nnot be prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of\nconsumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information from third-\nparty sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources\nor the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and\ninformation may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including general expectations\nconcerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size,\nare based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of\nassumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or\nthe methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or\nmethodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, we may lose the confidence of our investors and\nour reputation, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may\ncontinue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly\nleading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims\nbrought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and\nabroad may be necessary in the future to\n48\nTable of Contents\nenforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of\nothers. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise\nsecure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be\nineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com.\nIf we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable\nregistration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could\ncause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in\nquestion. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of\nreasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using\ndomain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that\ninfringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nProtecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source\nlicenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source\nsoftware license. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and\ntime and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected\nportions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and\nresources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software\nuntil we can adequately address the concerns.\n49\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that\nincorporate open source software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to\nfully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or\nother liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on\nterms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our\nplatform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source\ncode form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure,\nacquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic conditions. We believe\nour working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months\nand beyond. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures,\nstrategic initiatives, or investments and our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future\nissuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could\nsuffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges\nsuperior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time,\nand our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans,\nand operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be\nable to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfinancing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our\nbusiness growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to\nrefinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing,\nit may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2022,\nthere were no revolving loans outstanding and $99 million in aggregate face amount of letters of credit issued\nunder our revolving credit facility.\n50\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2022, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering,\nand a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of\nour board of directors collectively held 61% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate,\nwhich voting power may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards\n(including those equity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to our initial public offering (\"IPO\") and subject\nto equity exchange right agreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require\nus to exchange any shares of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class\nA common stock or the vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent\nnumber of shares of Class B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO\nPerformance Award) had been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31,\n2022, our Co-Founders would collectively hold 73% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-\nFounders have also entered into the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable\nproxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their\nrespective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by\nstockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the\napproval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our\ncertificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from\nyours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated\ncontrol may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive\nour stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company,\nand might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting\npower and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders,\nwhich may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or\nour Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our IPO, which we sometimes refer to\nherein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr.\nXu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person\ndesignated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person, then our secretary then\nin office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days\nfollowing the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180\ndays following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or\nconsultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary\nresignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to\nbe renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of all\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date.\"\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually\n51\nTable of Contents\nresult in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power, Mr. Xu would no longer\nhave the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted for\na vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would have no voting rights (except as\nrequired by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution, which would prolong the\nvoting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to Mr. Xu would also delay\nthe final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class C common stock issued\nto Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met. As a result, the\nissuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our voting power and\nhis ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our\nstockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our Co-Founders and, in that event,\nthey would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their holdings without\ndiminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will not be subject to\napproval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail\nourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2022, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of\nthe voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a\n“controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange\nregarding corporate governance, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\nthe requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance\nevaluation of the committee; and\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,\nand the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal\nadvisors, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled\ncompany” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these\nexemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the\nNew York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the\nprotections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it\nwill no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices\ninclude the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P\nComposite 1500. Under such announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible\nfor inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment\nvehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are\nrelatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the long-term valuations of publicly-traded\ncompanies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar\ncompanies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into\n52\nTable of Contents\npassive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude\ninvestment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a\nresult, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\n53\nTable of Contents\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously registered shares for future issuance\nunder our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the\nshares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be\navailable for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to\nrepurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock\nprice.\nWe have authorized share repurchase programs in the past and may authorize other share repurchase programs in the\nfuture. Under existing or any future share repurchase programs, we may make share repurchases through a variety of\nmethods, including open share market purchases, block transactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in\naccordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our share repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not\nobligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and\nwithout prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price,\nmarket and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements, such as Delaware surplus and\nsolvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have\nannounced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may\nnegatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would\nbe and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance\nlong-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common\nstock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could\nreduce the effectiveness of our repurchase programs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases\nin the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we\ngrant to our employees.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements,\nand we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\n54\nTable of Contents\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and\nrestated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state\nor federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n55\nTable of Contents\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.",

Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third parties (individually or as class\nactions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For\nsome matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses\nis not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a\nmaterial loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought\nunder PAGA and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the\nclassification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. In January 2022, the Superior Court of\nCalifornia, County of Los Angeles, granted final approval of a revised settlement agreement pursuant to which we\nagreed to pay $100 million to the representatives of Dashers that had filed certain actions in California and\nMassachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging worker misclassification of\nDashers (the \"Marko settlement\"). All legal matters under the Marko settlement have been resolved and all amounts\nrelated to the Marko settlement were paid by us during the second quarter of 2022. See the section titled “Legal\nProceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Quarterly Report on\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 for additional information regarding the proceedings related to the\nMarko settlement.\nVarious other Dashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their\nclassification on our platform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law,\nseeking monetary, injunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by\nindividual Dashers, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to\nour independent contractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco\nDistrict Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California\nLabor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both\nrestitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers\nas independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range\nof losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law in September\n2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the standard in Dynamex regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies,\nsupported a campaign for Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was\napproved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners\nconsisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County\nSuperior Court to compel the State of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as\nunconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding\nthat the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based\nDrivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 filed appeals in the California Court of\nAppeal.\nIn addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may\npropose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, which would pair worker\nflexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing discussions with\nDashers, policy makers, and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that Dashers perform. To\nthe extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or\nother legislative processes, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we\ncould experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of\nsuch laws, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and\nsimilar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation.\nAdditionally, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to AB 5 to determine worker\nclassification.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. Further, in certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of\napplicable law, we may decide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result\nin certain operational challenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain countries or decide not\nto expand our business in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion opportunities.\n57\nTable of Contents\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nour former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty and/or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to\ndefend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our\nbusiness practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with\nconsumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation\ninsurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of\nthe State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued a negative\nassessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the CA EDD’s assessment,\nand intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. For more information on the CA EDD's assessment, see Note 10 –\n\"Commitments and Contingencies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related governmental action are\ninherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry having a\nmaterial impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an\ninvestigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action.\nRegardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with\ncooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or\nother incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have\nmeritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no\npending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\nhowever, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors.",

We provide a local\ncommerce platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive\nin today’s convenience economy.\nWe operate a local commerce platform that connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our primary offerings are the\nDoorDash Marketplace, which operates in four countries including the United States, and the Wolt Marketplace, which\noperates in 23 countries, most of which are in Europe. Both of our Marketplaces provide a suite of services that\nenable merchants to establish an online presence, generate demand, seamlessly transact with consumers, and fulfill\norders primarily through Dashers. As part of our Marketplaces, we also offer Pickup, which allows consumers to\nplace advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash\nfor Work, which\n60\nTable of Contents\nprovides merchants on our platform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The\nDoorDash Marketplace also includes DashPass and the Wolt Marketplace includes Wolt+. DashPass and Wolt+ are our\nmembership products, which provide members with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and\nreduced service fees on eligible orders.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer Platform Services, which primarily includes DoorDash Drive and Wolt\nDrive, which are white-label delivery fulfillment services that enable merchants that have generated consumer\ndemand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our platform. Platform Services also includes\nStorefront, which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a\nturnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or\nfulfillment capabilities, and Bbot, which offers merchants solutions for their in-store and online channels,\nincluding in-store digital ordering and payments.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 33,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at\nthe public offering price of $102 per share. We received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our shares in\nthe IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses.

For more information regarding our use\nof these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed through our Marketplaces and Platform Services\nbusinesses over the period of measurement.\nIn 2022, Total Orders increased to 1.7 billion, or 25% growth compared to 2021. The increase in Total Orders was\ndriven primarily by growth in consumers and increased consumer engagement as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\n61\nTable of Contents\nMarketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplaces,\nincluding taxes, tips 5 , and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass and\nWolt+. Marketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does not\ninclude the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through\nDrive and Storefront.\nIn 2022, Marketplace GOV increased to $53.4 billion, or 27% growth compared to 2021, driven primarily by organic\ngrowth in Total Orders as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\nContribution Profit (Loss). We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and\nmarketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,\n(iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off\nrelated to restructuring. Gross profit (loss) is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn 2022, Contribution Profit improved to $1.6 billion, compared to a Contribution Profit of $1.1 billion in 2021,\ndriven primarily by growth in Marketplace GOV, an increase in Net Revenue Margin, defined as revenue expressed as a\npercentage of Marketplace GOV, and leverage on sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in\ncost of revenue.\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certa in limitations regarding its usefulness. It\ndoes not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain\nexpenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss)\nis not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is\nnot a financial measure of total company profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total\ncompany profitability nor does it imply profitability for our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests,\nadjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on\ndisposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition,\nintegration, and investment related costs), (iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory\nwrite-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest (income) and\nexpense, (ix) other (income) expense, net, (x) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense,\nand (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage\nin our business.\nIn 2022 , Adjusted EBITDA increased to $361 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $289 million in 2021 , as\ngrowth in Contribution Profit was partially offset by organic increases in adjusted research and development\nexpenses and adjusted general and administrative expenses, as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\nFree Cash Flow. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and\nequipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nIn 2022 , Free Cash Flow decreased to $21 million, compared to Free Cash Flow of $455 million in 2021, driven\nprimarily by changes in operating assets and liabilities and increases in cash outflows from purchases of property\nand equipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplaces and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\n5 Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n62\nTable of Contents\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our\nMarketplaces to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our Marketplaces to\narrange for delivery services. We recognize reve nue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an agent for\nboth partner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects comm issions charged to partner merchants and\nfees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which includes certain\ndiscounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer. Revenue from our\nMarketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part\nof our Marketplaces revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable\nbasis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership\npurchased by the consumer.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Platform Services, which primarily consists\nof our Drive and Storefront offerings. We generate revenue from Drive by collecting per-order fees from merchants\nto arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels.

As a result of the valuation allowance, such income tax benefit is not expected to recur in the future.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense,\nadjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit\n(Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our\noverall\n67\nTable of Contents\nassessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our\nbusiness and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to\ninvestors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance\nand future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their\nfinancial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors\nin seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these\nnon-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of\nour business over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted\nresearch and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss),\nContribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow\nshould be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted\nEBITDA, and Free Cash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others\nto review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single\nfinancial measure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research\nand development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution\nMargin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction\nwith their respective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, allocated overhead, and inventory write-off related to\nrestructuring.

In\nFebruary 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible Notes in full for $375\nmillion.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of shares of\nour Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $3.9 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2.0 billion, and short-term marketable securities\nof $1.5 billion and long-term marketable securities of $397 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $441 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds and commercial paper. Marketable\nsecurities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. Treasury\nsecurities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $3.8\nbillion as of December 31, 2022. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may\nincur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may\nrequire additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nalong with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be\nsufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nWe have an obligation to our insurance provider which requires us to set aside collateral of up to $265 million in\nan escrow account. As of December 31, 2022, we had established and deposited into an escrow account an amount of\n$199 million, which is restricted from general use. We deposited the remaining collateral amount of $66 million on\nFebruary 1, 2023.\nIn February 2023, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $750 million. This program is in addition to the prior\nrepurchase program for the repurchase of $400 million shares of our Class A common stock, which was completed in\nthe third quarter of 2022. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through\nprivately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant\nfactors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of\nthe Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our\nClass A common stock under this authorization. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a\nvariety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment\nopportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be\n72\nTable of Contents\nrequired to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from\noutside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise\nadditional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\n(In millions)                                                     2020         2021       2022\nNet cash provided by operating              $                      252    $     692    $   367\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                             -192       -2,047       -300\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing                         3,996         -483       -375\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                2           -1        -10\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash       $                    4,058    $  -1,839    $  -318\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $367 million for 2022 . This primarily consisted of a net loss of $1.4\nbillion, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily includes $889 million of non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense, $369 million of depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash reduction of operating\nlease right-of-use assets, $303 million of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including impairment,\nnet, and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $81 million, as well as $73 million net inflows from changes\nin operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses. The decrease in cash\nprovided by operating activities for 2022 compared to 2021 was mainly due to the increase in net loss for 2022 .\nCash provided by operating activities was $692 million for 2021 . This consisted of a net loss of $468 million,\noffset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $486 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense\nof $156 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease\nliabilities of $52 million, and non-cash bad debt expense of $36 million, as well as $391 million net inflows from\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $300 million for 2022 , which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $1.9 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $176 million, cash outflows for capitalized\nsoftware and website development costs of $170 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $15\nmillion, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.9 billion and net cash\nacquired in acquisitions of $71 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $2.0 billion for 2021 , which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable\nsecurities of $2.3 billion, purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $409 million, purchases of property\nand equipment of $129 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $108\nmillion, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $944 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used by financing activities was $375 million for 2022 , which consisted repurchases of our Class A common\nstock of $400 million, partially offset by cash received from other financing activities of $14 million and\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options of $11 million.\nCash used by financing activities was $483 million for 2021 , which consisted of $333 million of repayment of the\nconvertible promissory notes, $172 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of\nequity awards, and $10 million of payment of deferred offering costs, partially offset by $32 million of proceeds\nfrom the exercise of stock options.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and\n73\nTable of Contents\nliabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of\nrevenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various\nother assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual\nresults, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\ncould be affected.\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant\nAccounting Policies\" included Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report\non Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606 . We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\nconsumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash.\nRevenue from our Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the\nmerchant’s products. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is\nrecognized as part of our Marketplaces. Revenue generated from DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a\nratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of\nmembership purchased by the consumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting\nper-order fees from merchants that use our local commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill\ndemand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nOur local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a\nprincipal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation\nservice are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation\nservice and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplaces. The consumer accesses our local\ncommerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor does it\nobtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our\nrole with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to\nprospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and\ndelivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\n74\nTable of Contents\nGift Cards\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through our Marketplaces. Those gift cards have no expiration\ndate and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited history as to\nconsumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded as contract\nliabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is\nrecognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts remitted to\nmerchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that we had developed sufficient\nhistorical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have the ability to estimate the\nportion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for which there is no legal\nobligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned\nproperty. We recognize the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the\ngift card redemptions. We recorded $48 million and $47 million of gift card breakage revenue during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and\nhistorical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These\nare offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak\ndemand time.\nDasher referrals : We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new\nDasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers\nas incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of\nour platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in\nexcess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nPayments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions\nbelieved to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results\nmay differ from estimates. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited\noperational history, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry\nclaim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected\nloss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information\nbecomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our\nreserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible.\n75\nTable of Contents\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions\non a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements,\nrulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting\nPolicies\" included Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K.",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes\nother than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these\nsecurities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the\nearly stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies. However,\nwe believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $409 million and $124 million as of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Adjustments or impairments are recorded in other income (expense), net on\nthe consolidated statements of operations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported\nincome (loss) from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued\nstrengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international\nbusinesses included in our consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of\ntransaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nForeign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Based on\nour foreign currency exposures from\n76\nTable of Contents\nmonetary assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022, we estimated that a 10% change in exchange rates against\nthe U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss which\nis part of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\n77\nTable of Contents",

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S.\ngenerally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects,\neffective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway\nCommission.\nThe Company acquired Bbot, LLC (“Bbot”) and Wolt Enterprises Oy (“Wolt”) during 2022, and management excluded from\nits assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,\n2022, Bbot’s and Wolt’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets (excluding acquired\ngoodwill and intangible assets) of 5% and total revenues of 4% included in the consolidated financial statements of\nthe Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting\nof the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Bbot and Wolt.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n79\nTable of Contents\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on\nthe accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition-date fair value of acquired intangible assets\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on May 31, 2022, the Company acquired Wolt\nEnterprises Oy (Wolt) in a business combination for $2,838 million, which was accounted for under the acquisition\nmethod of accounting that requires allocation of the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and\nintangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The\nCompany recognized an acquired merchant relationships intangible asset associated with the generation of future\nincome from Wolt’s existing merchants using a replacement cost method. Additionally, the Company recognized a\ntrademark intangible asset associated with the value of Wolt’s brand name and an existing technology intangible\nasset associated with Wolt’s existing online and mobile platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and pickup\norders using a relief-from-royalty method. The acquisition-date fair values of the merchant relationships,\ntrademark, and existing technology intangible assets were $236 million, $268 million and $150 million,\nrespectively.\nWe identified the evaluation of the acquisition-date fair value measurements of the aforementioned intangible\nassets as a critical audit matter. Due to limited observable market information, a high degree of subjective\nauditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions used to estimate the fair values, including the\ndiscount rate used in the valuation of each of the aforementioned intangible assets, and the revenue growth rates\nused in the valuation of the trademark and existing technology intangible assets. The estimated acquisition-date\nfair values of the aforementioned intangible assets were sensitive to changes to these assumptions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition-\ndate valuation process, including controls related to the development of the estimated revenue growth rates and\ndiscount rate. We evaluated the Company’s forecasted revenue growth rates by comparing them to those of Wolt’s\ncomparable peers and industry reports. We compared the Company’s estimate of forecasted revenue growth in the first\nyear to Wolt’s actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. We involved valuation\nprofessionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\nevaluating the appropriateness of the comparable companies selected by the Company’s third-party valuation\nadvisor used to determine the revenue growth rates by assessing the business description of the comparable\ncompanies and the industries in which they operate; and\nevaluating the discount rate used in the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets by (1) assessing the\nreasonableness of the estimated market participant weighted average cost of capital (WACC) through a comparison of\ninputs to available market data, and (2) evaluating the reasonableness of the discount from the\n80\nTable of Contents\nWACC to the discount rate used in the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets by assessing the risk of\nthe individual assets relative to the overall acquired business through a weighted average return on assets\nanalysis.\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance which\ninclude retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and\nphysical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained\ninsurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have\nbeen incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves as of\nDecember 31, 2022 was $418 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter.\nThe evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and\nexpected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized\nskill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s retained insurance\ndeductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss\ndevelopment factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by\nselecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 24,

Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”) is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The\nCompany operates a local commerce platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease\nand immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.\nThe Company operates a local commerce platform that connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company's\nprimary offerings are the DoorDash Marketplace, which operates in fourcountries including the United States, and\nthe Wolt Marketplace, which operates in 23countries, most of which are in Europe. Both the DoorDash Marketplace and\nthe Wolt Marketplace (\"Marketplaces\") provide a suite of services that enable merchants to establish an online\npresence, generate demand, seamlessly transact with consumers, and fulfill orders primarily through independent\ncontractors who use the Company’s platform to deliver orders (“Dashers”). As part of the Marketplaces, the Company\nalso offers Pickup, which allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders\nconveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the Company’s\nplatform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The DoorDash Marketplace also\nincludes DashPass and the Wolt Marketplace includes Wolt+. DashPass and Wolt+ are the Company’s membership\nproducts, which provide members with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced\nservice fees on eligible orders. In addition to the Marketplaces, the Company offers Platform Services, which\nprimarily includes DoorDash Drive and Wolt Drive (\"Drive\"), which are white-label delivery fulfillment services\nthat enable merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using\nthe Company’s platform. Platform Services also includes DoorDash Storefront (\"Storefront\"), which enables merchants\nto create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers\non-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or fulfillment capabilities, and Bbot\n(\"Bbot\"), which offers merchants solutions for their in-store and online channels, including in-store digital\nordering and payments.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in which it issued and sold\n33million shares of its Class A common stock at the public offering price of $ 102.00per share. The Company\nreceived net proceeds of $ 3.3billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all shares of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock automatically converted into 239million shares of its common stock. Additionally, immediately prior\nto the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which\nauthorizes a total of 6.0billion shares of Class A common stock, 200million shares of Class B common stock,\n2.0billion shares of Class C common stock, and 600million shares of preferred stock. Upon the filing of the Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 285million shares of the Company’s common stock were automatically\nreclassified into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Reclassification”).\nImmediately after the Reclassification and prior to the completion of the IPO, a total of 31million shares of Class\nA common stock held by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for\nan equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a\nresult, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has three classes of authorized common stock: Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, of which Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock were outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.\nThe Company granted certain employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with both service-based and liquidity event-\nrelated performance vesting conditions (\"IPO Vested RSUs\"). Upon the consummation of the Company’s IPO, the Company\nrecognized $ 279million of stock-based compensation expense for IPO Vested RSUs as the performance vesting\ncondition was satisfied. One share of Class A common stock for each of the IPO Vested RSUs was settled and\ndelivered on June 7, 2021 (the “IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date”). The future tax benefits on settlement of the\nabove RSUs is not expected to be material as currently the Company has established valuation allowances to reduce\nits net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\n88\nTable of Contents\nTo meet the related tax withholding requirements related to IPO Vested RSUs, for stockholders who elected to net\nshare settle, the Company withheld 65,058shares of Class A common stock subject to the vesting of the IPO Vested\nRSUs and paid $ 7million to the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations as well as any\nincome tax withholding obligations arising as a result of settlement of such shares. Certain employees elected to\nreceive a short-term loan from the Company, with interest that accrued at the applicable federal rate. The short-\nterm loan extended to employees totaled $ 10million, which was repaid from the proceeds of the sale of shares into\nthe market on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries and entities consolidated under the variable interest entity model, and have been prepared in\naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to\nan individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.\nThe CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it\noperates in onereportable segment.See Note 3 – \"Revenue\" for revenue by geography. Long-lived assets, which consist\nof property and equipment, net and operating lease right-of-use assets, located outside of the United States were $\n28million and $ 124million a s of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related\ndisclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit\nlosses, gift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website\ndevelopment costs, intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other\nfinancial instruments including valuation of investments without readily determinable fair values, valuation of\nacquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, insurance\nreserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of\nassets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as\nincurred.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their\n89\nTable of Contents\ncarrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Restricted cash consists of collateral\nprovided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies.As of December\n31, 2021 and 2022, the restricted cash balances were $ 2million and $ 211million, respectively.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, and corporate bonds. The Company invests in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities and limits\nthe concentration of its investment in any particular security. Securities with maturities greater than three\nmonths, but less than one year, are included in current assets and securities with maturities greater than one year\nare included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All marketable securities are classified as\navailable-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the\nCompany evaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors\nconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the\namortized cost basis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically\nrelated to the security, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\nWhen a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the\ndebt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be\nrecorded. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, no allowance of credit losses related to marketable securities was\nrecorded. Unrealized losses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nFunds held at payment processors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for transactions with\nmerchants and consumers, as well as funds transferred to payment processors for Dasher payout.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on the Company’s assessment of\nthe collectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a\ncollective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer’s expected ability to pay and\ncollection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged\nagainst the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.Disposals were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022.\n90\nTable of Contents\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets for impairment\nunder the long-lived asset model described under “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2022 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Noimpairment charge was recorded in any\nof the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nNon-Marketable Equity Securities\nNon-marketable equity securities which the Company does not have a controlling financial interest in and does not\nexercise significant influence over the investee are recorded at cost and adjusted for observable transactions for\nsame or similar investments of the same issuer (referred to as the measurement alternative) or impairment.\nThe carrying value is not adjusted for the Company’s non-marketable equity securities if there are no observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are no identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment.\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurred costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the\npost implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform\nare capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and\ncommitted project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\nintended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized\nand expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair\nvalue less costs to sell. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company recognized\nimpairment charges of $ 11million, $ 1million and $ 2million, respectively, related to an operating lease right-of-\nuse asset associated with its former headquarters, which the Company subleased to another company.\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but\nnot paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s ultimate deductible\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given its limited\noperational history, the Company utilizes\n91\nTable of Contents\nassumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss development\nfactors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are\nperiodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However,\nultimate results may differ from the Company’s estimates, which could result in losses over the Company’s reserved\namounts.During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, the Company recorded additions to the insurance\nreserves of $ 63million, $ 134million and $ 359million, respectively. The Company’s retained insurance deductibles\nreserves as of December 31, 2022 was $ 418million.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and\nunrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s\nforeign subsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into\nU.S. dollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are\ntranslated using average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on\nthe date of grant. Prior to November 2020, RSUs granted by the Company vest upon the satisfaction of both a\nservice-based vesting condition, which is typically four years, and a liquidity event-related performance vesting\ncondition. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was achieved upon the consummation of the\nCompany's IPO, and the Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $ 279million as of the IPO\ndate for those RSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied. Stock-based compensation\nrelated to the remaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was\nsatisfied will be recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method.\nSince November 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award and options assumed via acquisition (as\ndiscussed further in Note 12 - \"Common Stock\"), the Company only granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a\nservice-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis\nover the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award (as defined below) that includes a market condition, the fair value of the award was\ndetermined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-based compensation is recorded over the\nderived service period, using the accelerated attribution method. If the stock price goals are met sooner than the\nderived service period, the Company will adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect the cumulative\nexpense associated with the vested award. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the\nCompany, stock-based compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, regardless of whether\nthe stock price goals are achieved.\n92\nTable of Contents\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options and RSUs has\nhistorically been determined by the Company’s board of directors as there is no public market for the underlying\ncommon stock. The Company’s board of directors determined the fair value of the Company’s common stock by\nconsidering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-party valuations of its\ncommon stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including the IPO), the Company’s operating and\nfinancial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry specific economic outlook, amongst\nother factors. After the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock is determined\nbased on the New York Stock Exchange (the \"NYSE\") closing price on the date of grant.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net\namount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both\npositive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of\nfuture taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market\nparticipants would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current liabilities approximate their fair values due\nto their short maturities.\n93\nTable of Contents\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes\nthat the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits\npurchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit\nlosses historically.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher payouts. Payment processors are\nfinancial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. The Company\nretains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processors, which are included in funds held at\npayment processors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be remitted to\nDashers and merchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the Company pre-\nauthorizes forms of payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering.As of December 31, 2021, two entities in dividually accounted for 15% and 14% of accounts\nreceivable, net, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, one entity in dividually accounted for 14% of accounts\nreceivable, net. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and\n2022.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through its Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to\npartner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a\ncontractual agreement with the Company. Revenue from the Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the\nconsumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership fees paid\nby consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part of the Marketplaces . Revenue generated from the\nCompany’s DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is\ngenerally one monthto one yeardepending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, the\nCompany also generates revenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its\nlocal commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels.\nRevenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\ncommerce platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local commerce platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\nThe Company’s local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation\nservice and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item\nseparately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable\nas the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service\nindividually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation\n94\nTable of Contents\nservices, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether it controls\neach specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through its Marketplaces. The consumer accesses the Company’s\nlocal commerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked\nup from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the products prior to\nthem being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer\nnor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to the vast majority of its delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as\nan agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the\nCompany’s role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered\nto prospective Dashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nIn the vast majority of its transactions with end-users, the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of\nproducts and delivery services, thus the Company reports revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from\nconsumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nDasher payout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for\ncertain referral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a\nreduction in Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other\ncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled on a weekly basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nThe Company also provides value-add services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. Revenue generated\nfrom such services is not material in all periods presented.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. Th ose gift cards have no\nexpiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited\nhistory as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded\nas contract liabilities until consumers used the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are\nredeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less\namounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company concluded that it\nhad developed sufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have\nthe ability to estimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for\nwhich there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as\nunclaimed or abandoned property. The Company recognizes the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the\npattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. The Company recorded $ 48million and $ 47million of\ngift card breakage revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Estimating future\nbreakage rates requires judgment based on current and historical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage\nrates may vary from the estimate.\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local commerce platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below.\n95\nTable of Contents\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.Advertising expenses were $ 698million, $ 1.2billion and $ 1.1billion for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per common share following the two-class method required for multiple classes of\ncommon stock and participating securities. The Company considers its previously outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to be participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to DoorDash,\nInc. common stockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and participating\nsecurities based upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been\ndistributed. The holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in\npreference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any\nremaining earnings would be distributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common\nstock pro rata on an as-converted basis. These holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock are\nnot contractually obligated to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, the Company’s net losses were not\nallocated to these participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the\nClass A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock are substantially identical, other than voting\nrights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock shared proportionately in the Company’s net\nlosses. Noshares of Class C common stock were issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2022. Prior to the\ncompletion of the IPO, there were noshares of Class B common stock issued and outstanding.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the\nperiod. For periods in\n96\nTable of Contents\nwhich the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic net loss per common\nshare, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs that have not been settled have\nbeen included in the appropriate common share class used to calculate basic net loss per share.\nUpon completion of the Company's IPO, all of the Company’s outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred\nstock were automatically converted into 239million shares of common stock and their carrying amount reclassified\ninto stockholders' (deficit) equity.As of December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, there were noshares of redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nLeases\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nROU assets represents the Company's right to use the underlying assets for the lease term and lease liabilities\nrepresents the Company's obligation to make lease payment arising from the lease. The Company has elected the\npractical expedient not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities for short-term leases with terms of twelve\nmonths or less. Expense related to short-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as\nincurred depending on whether the lease payments are fixed or variable. ROU assets are recognized as the lease\nliability, adjusted for lease incentives received. Lease liabilities are recognized at the present value of the\nfuture lease payments at the lease commencement date. The Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real\nestate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating\nlease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases\nconsist of equipment leases and are included in property and equipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance\nsheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and activities related to finance leases were not\nmaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from fourto five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no\nresidual value guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ntypically borrow on a collateralized basis, it uses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for\ncollateralization, current available yield curves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate\nincremental borrowing rate.\nVariable Interest Entities\nThe Company evaluates its ownership, contractual and other interests in entities to determine if it has a variable\ninterest in an entity and if it is the primary beneficiary. These evaluations are complex and involve judgment and\nthe use of estimates and assumptions based on available historical and prospective information, among other\nfactors. If the Company determines that entities for which the Company holds a contractual or ownership interest in\nare variable interest entities (\"VIE\") and that the Company is the primary beneficiary, the Company consolidates\nsuch entities in the consolidated financial statements. The primary beneficiary of a VIE is the party that meets\nboth of the following criteria: (1) has the power to make decisions that most significantly affect the economic\nperformance of the VIE and (2) has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that in either\ncase could potentially be significant to the VIE. Periodically, the Company determines whether any changes in the\ninterest or relationship with the entity impacts the determination of whether the Company is still the primary\nbeneficiary. If the Company is not deemed to be the primary beneficiary in a VIE, the Company accounts for the\ninvestment or other variable interests in a VIE in accordance with applicable GAAP.\n97\nTable of Contents\nRestructuring\nCosts and liabilities associated with management-approved restructuring activities are recognized when they are\nincurred. One-time employee termination costs are recognized at the time of communication to employees, unless\nfuture service is required, in which case the costs are recognized over the future service period. Ongoing employee\ntermination benefits are recognized as a liability when it is probable that a liability exists and the amount is\nreasonably estimable. Restructuring charges are recognized as an operating expense within the consolidated\nstatements of operations and related liabilities are recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non the consolidated balance sheets. The Company periodically evaluates and, if necessary, adjusts its estimates\nbased on currently available information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\")\n2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) : Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts\nwith Customers, which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and\ncontract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606, as if it had\noriginated the contracts. Under the current business combinations guidance, such assets and liabilities are\nrecognized by the acquirer at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The Company early adopted the guidance in 2022\nand the impact of the adoption was not material.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomprised of the Company's Marketplaces and Platform Services.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of the Company's\nmembership products, the address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020        2021        2022\nUnited States    $                    2,875    $  4,877    $  6,251\nInternational                            11          11         332\nTotal revenue    $                    2,886    $  4,888    $  6,583\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers\nand merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized over\ntime. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the year ended December 31, 2022 was as follows\n(in millions):\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\nBeginning balance                          $                           183\nAddition to contract liabilities                                     1,807\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                             -1,739\nEnding balance                             $                           251\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 68million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2022. The ending\nbalance of unearned prepayments is expected to be recognized as revenue in 12 months or less.\n98\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense\nand amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue,\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A summary of activities\nrelated to deferred contract costs was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021       2022\nBeginning balance                          $                       21    $    43    $    62\nCapitalization of deferred contract                                32         39         70\ncosts\nAmortization of deferred contract costs                           -10        -20        -32\nEnding balance                             $                       43    $    62    $   100\nDeferred contract costs, current           $                       16    $    25    $    36\nDeferred contract costs, non-current                               27         37         64\nTotal deferred contract costs              $                       43    $    62    $   100\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable and changes were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021       2022\nBeginning balance                           $                        2    $    13    $    39\nAdditions to the provision for expected                             16         37          —\ncredit losses\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance                            -5        -11        -19\nEnding balance                              $                       13    $    39    $    20\n4. Acquisitions\nWolt Acquisition\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100percent of the outstanding equity interests of Wolt\nEnterprises Oy (“Wolt”). The Company's aim is to accelerate its product development, increase its international\nscale, bring greater focus to its markets outside the United States, and improve the value provided to consumers,\nmerchants, as well as Dashers around the world. The Company’s acquisition-related costs for the year ended December\n31, 2022 were $ 48million. All costs were recorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s\nconsolidated statements of operations during the period in which they were incurred. The acquisition date fair\nvalue of the consideration transferred for Wolt was $ 2,838million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nDoorDash Class A common stock             $       2,705\nStock-based compensation awards\n(DoorDash options, RSUs, and revesting                   133\ncommon stock) attributable to\npre-combination services\nTotal consideration                       $       2,838\nThe fair value of 36million shares of Class A common stock issued was determined on the basis of the closing market\nprice of the Company’s Class A common stock on the acquisition date. The Company also issued certain stock-based\ncompensation awards and their fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the\napplicable assumptions as of the acquisition date for options ( 1.7million DoorDash options) and using the closing\nmarket price of the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date for RSUs ( 1.4million DoorDash RSUs).\n99\nTable of Contents\nFor certain Wolt employees, a portion of their total consideration transferred was restricted subject to revesting\nover a service period, including 568thousand shares of the Company's Class A common stock. This restricted equity\nconsideration is considered compensation for post-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based\ncompensation expense over the next four years, based on the fair value of the shares using the closing market price\nof the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date.\nThe total purchase consideration of the Wolt acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The\nCompany recorded $ 1,994million of goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net assets\nacquired. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Wolt and anticipated synergies from the\nfuture growth and strategic advantages in the global local commerce industry. The goodwill recorded in connection\nwith the acquisition of Wolt is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, and are considered preliminary and subject to\nchange within the measurement period, including potential adjustments to sales tax balances and other liabilities,\nas additional information is received. During the three months period ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded\nmeasurement period adjustments which had an immaterial impact on the total consideration and the preliminary\nallocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The Company\nexpects to finalize the allocation of the purchase price as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from\nthe acquisition date when the measurement period ends.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the\nacquisition date (in millions):\nMay 31, 2022\nCurrent assets                   $           272\nIntangible assets                            772\nGoodwill                                   1,994\nOther non-current assets                      82\nCurrent liabilities                         -201\nDeferred tax liability, net                  -34\nOther non-current liabilities                -47\nTotal purchase price             $         2,838\nThe following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their estimated\nuseful life as of the date of acquisition (in years):\nEstimated Useful\nLife       May 31, 2022\nMerchant relationships                            11    $           236\nTrademark                                         10                268\nExisting technology                                6                150\nCustomer relationships                             3                107\nCourier relationships                              1                 11\nTotal acquired intangible assets                        $           772\nExisting technology represents the existing online and mobile Wolt platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and\npickup orders. The merchant, customer, and courier relationships represent the fair value of the underlying\nrelationships with merchants, such as restaurants and grocery stores, users of Wolt’s food and delivery services,\nand courier partners. The estimated fair values of the existing technology and trademarks were determined using a\nrelief from royalty method. The fair values of the merchant, courier and customer relationships were determined\nusing a replacement cost method. The Company expects to amortize the fair value of these intangible assets on a\nstraight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.\nFrom the date of acquisition through December 31, 2022, the amount of revenue and net loss from Wolt included in\nthe consolidated statements of operations were $ 259million and $ 345million, respectively.\nThe following unaudited pro forma results presents the combined revenue and net loss as if the Wolt acquisition had\nbeen completed on January 1, 2021, the beginning of the comparable annual reporting period. The unaudited pro forma\ninformation is based on estimates and assumptions which the Company believes are reasonable and primarily reflects\n100\nTable of Contents\nadjustments for the pro forma impact of additional amortization related to the fair value of acquired intangible\nassets and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes only and are\nnot necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have been if the\nacquisition had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they indicative of future results of\noperations. The unaudited pro forma results are as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December\n31,                         2021         2022\nRevenue                            $   5,128    $   6,734\nNet loss                           $  -1,039    $  -1,549\nBbot Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired Bbot, Inc., a hospitality technology company. The addition of Bbot's\nproducts and technology to the Company's platform will offer merchants more solutions for their in-store and online\nchannels, including in-store digital ordering and payments. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition\nmethod of accounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $ 88million in cash, including a $\n9million indemnification holdback, which was recorded in other liabilities.\nThe total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities\nassumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the anticipated\nsynergies from the future growth opportunities from the adoption of Bbot’s technology by the Company’s merchants.\nThe goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Bbot is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair value\nof assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, and are\nconsidered preliminary pending finalization of the valuation analyses pertaining to assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, which primarily relate to acquired intangible assets. During the three months period ended December 31,\n2022, the Company recorded measurement period adjustments which had an immaterial impact on the preliminary\nallocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The measurement\nperiod will end no later than one-year from the acquisition date.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the\nacquisition date (in millions):\nMarch 1, 2022\nCurrent assets          $             11\nIntangible assets                     18\nGoodwill                              60\nOther liabilities                     -1\nTotal purchase price    $             88\nThe intangible assets acquired consisted of existing technology and customer relationships, which had estimated\nremaining useful lives of 5and 3years as of the date of the acquisition, respectively.\nThe acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\n5.

The fair value of the Company’s Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from\nindependent pricing services, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments in less\nactive markets or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes in a same or\nsimilar security from the same issuer occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable\ntransaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company made investments in non-marketable equity securities\nof $ 409million and $ 18million, respectively, for equity securities of private companies including an investment\nof $ 395million in preferred shares of a grocery delivery platform company during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAll those investments were accounted for using the measurement alternative, where the Company adjusts the value of\nthe\n103\nTable of Contents\ninvestments based on changes in value due to observable price changes for identical or similar securities of the\ninvestee or impairment.\nThe Company evaluates investments in non-marketable equity securities for impairment based on a qualitative\nassessment considering various impairment indicators. The Company determined impairment indicators existed as of\nDecember 31, 2022 for the investment in the grocery delivery platform company. A valuation was performed to\ncalculate an equity value of the investee, using a market approach, which was then allocated to the preferred\nshares owned by the Company based on contractual rights and preferences using the option pricing model (“OPM”).

Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2023 and 2035. Certain\nof these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant\nallowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term. Lease\ncosts, net of sublease income, was $ 46million, $ 66million, and $ 86million during the years ended December 31,\n2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively.\nThe components of lease costs related to the Company’s operating leases included in the consolidated statements of\noperations for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021       2022\nOperating lease cost     $                       40    $    52    $    81\nShort-term lease cost                            11         17          9\nSublease income                                  -5         -3         -4\nTotal lease cost         $                       46    $    66    $    86\nLease terms and discount rates for operating leases were as follows:\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2021            2022\nWeighted-average remaining lease term            9.77            8.08\n(in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate                  6.81%           6.39%\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2021       2022\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows for operating         $                       46    $    75\nleases\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new\nlease liabilities\nOperating leases                           $                      164    $   154\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company had entered into long term non-cancelable real estate lease contracts\nof $ 19million and $ 21million, respectively, for which leases have not yet commenced. Such leases are not included\nin the operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\n106\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2022, the future minimum lease payments required under operating leases were as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ending December 31,                             Amount\n2023                                                     96\n2024                                                     98\n2025                                                     91\n2026                                                     84\n2026                                                     63\nThereafter                                              274\nTotal future minimum lease payments                     706\nLess: Lease not commenced                               -21\nLess: Imputed interest                                 -157\nLess: Tenant improvement receivable                     -17\nPresent value of future minimum lease payments    $     511\nFuture minimum sublease income as of December 31, 2022 is $ 8million.\n9. Promissory Notes\nIn February 2020, the Company issued convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 340million with an\ninitial maturity date in March 2025 (the “2020 Notes”). The Company received net proceeds of $ 333million, net of $\n2million in debt issuance costs, reflecting an original issue discount on the principal of $ 5million. The interest\nrate is 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.\nIn February 2021, the Company repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the 2020 Notes in full for $\n375million.\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,\nand such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex\nOperations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”). The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that\nwas signed into law in September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased\nlegal proceedings and related expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business\nmodel and operations. Further, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set\nforth in Dynamex to determine worker classification.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nconducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the\nclassification and compensation of Dashers, the DoorDash Dasher pay model, and other matters. For example, the\nCompany is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of California (the “CA EDD”) for\npayroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued an assessment for certain amounts that it found to be\nowed by the Company on behalf of Dashers due to their being classified as independent contractors. The Company\nbelieves that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors. Accordingly, the Company\nbelieves that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously appeal such adverse assessment. Results of\naudits and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an\naudit having a material impact on the Company's\n107\nTable of Contents\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations and the determination of a final assessment amount, and\nany related penalties, cannot currently be predicted with certainty but a loss at this time is not probable or\nestimable.\nIn January 2022, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted final approval of a revised\nsettlement agreement pursuant to which the Company agreed to pay $ 100million to the representatives of Dashers\nthat had filed certain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under the Private Attorney\nGeneral Act and class action claims alleging worker misclassification of Dashers against the Company (the \"Marko\nsettlement\"). All legal matters under the Marko settlement have been resolved and all amounts related to the Marko\nsettlement were paid by the Company during the second quarter of 2022. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings”\nin the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q\nfor the quarter ended June 30, 2022 for additional information regarding the proceedings related to the Marko\nsettlement.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to\nemployees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other\nallegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the\nCompany from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these\nindemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the\nindividual.\nNoliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2021 and 2022.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of onboarding, data\nprocessing, technology platform infrastructure, and advertising services. These purchase commitments are not\nrecorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2022 as the Company has not\nyet received the related services. As of December 31, 2022, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-\ncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2023                                   172\n2024                                   101\n2025                                     9\nTotal future minimum payments    $     282\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provided for a $\n300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. In August 2020, the Company amended\nand restated the revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide for $ 100million of incremental revolving loan\ncommitments, effective upon consummation of the Company's IPO, for total revolving commitments of $ 400million. The\namendment and restatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from November 19, 2024\nto August 7, 2025. Loans under the credit facility, as further amended on October 31, 2022, bear interest, at the\nCompany’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the federal\nfunds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted SOFR rate for a one-month\ninterest period plus 1.00%, or\n108\nTable of Contents\n(ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of one, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%.\nThe Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including\nletter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains\ncustomary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of\nproceeds, as well as customary negative covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among\nother things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends or make certain other\ndistributions, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments,\nloans and acquisitions, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2021 and 2022, norevolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\nThe Company maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2022, the Company had $ 60million and $ 132million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $ 39million and $ 99million were issued under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state and local tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect tax\nmatters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves when they become probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the\namounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may differ from the\namounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will receive additional\nassessments by various tax authorities in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments could result in changes to\nthe Company's reserves related to positions on sales and indirect tax filings.\n11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock purchase agreement\npursuant to which it issued a total of 8,321,395shares of Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock at $\n45.9062per share for gross proceeds of $ 382million. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material.\nThe Company previously issued Series A-1, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, and Series G\nprior to 2020. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on December 9, 2020, all outstanding shares of the\nCompany’s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate of 239,269,631shares of Class A common\nstock.\nThe following table summarizes the redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the\nconversion into common stock, and the rights and preferences of the Company’s respective series preceding the\nCompany’s IPO in December 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share\ndata):\nShares                                Per Share        Aggregate\nShares    Issued and          Issuance             Conversion       Liquidati…       Carrying\nSeries        Authorized    Outstandi…             Price                  Price       Preference          Value\nSeries A-1        13,330        13,330    $         0.15          $        0.15    $           2    $         7\nSeries A          27,159        27,159    $         0.73          $        0.73               20             20\nSeries B           7,925         7,925    $         5.68          $        5.48               45             45\nSeries C          26,839        26,839    $         4.79          $        4.79              128            128\nSeries D          98,008        98,008    $         5.51    -1    $        5.51              540            535\nSeries E          18,055        18,055    $        13.85          $       13.85              250            250\nSeries F          18,186        18,186    $        22.48          $       22.48              409            476\nSeries G          21,165        21,165    $        37.94          $       37.94              803            803\nSeries H           9,351         8,316    $        45.91          $       45.91              382            382\nTotal            240,018       238,983                                             $       2,579    $     2,646\n(1) The issuance price for Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock was $ 5.50688, except for shares issued\nvia the conversion of certain of the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2017, for which the\nconversion price was $ 4.78778per share.\n109\nTable of Contents\n12. Common Stock\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn May 2022, the Company authorized the repurchase of up to $ 400million of the Company’s Class A common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased 5.6million shares of its Class A common stock at a\nweighted average price of $ 71.84per share for a total amount of $ 400million. The shares were retired immediately\nupon repurchase.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company has granted restricted stock to certain continuing employees in connection with the Wolt acquisition.\nVesting of this stock is dependent on the respective employee’s continued employment at the Company during the\nrequisite service period, which is generally up to four yearsfrom the issuance date. The fair value of the\nrestricted stock issued to employees that is subject to post-acquisition employment is recorded as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe activities for the restricted stock issued to employees was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nWeighted-\nNumber of                    Average\nUnvested restricted stock as of December       Shares                 Grant Date\n31, 2021                                            —       Fair Value Per Share\nGranted                                           568    $                 76.91\nVested                                            -93    $                 76.91\nForfeited                                          -3    $                 76.91\nUnvested restricted stock as of December          472\n31, 2022\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\nStock options issued and outstanding       December 31, 2021    December 31, 2022\nunder the 2014 Plan and Inducement Plan               19,115               16,021\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 Plan,                 27,556               45,131\n2020 Plan and Inducement Plan\nRemaining shares available for future                 42,196               39,995\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                6,499                6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                                 95,366              107,646\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the \"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based\n110\nTable of Contents\nawards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of shares of common stock available\nfor issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014\nPlan. All outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to\nthe terms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO registration statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock\nappreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the\nCompany's employees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are\nforfeited, canceled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved\nfor issuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on\nJanuary 1, 2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total\nnumber of all classes of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each\nautomatic increase, or (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to\nthe applicable January 1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nthe Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten\nyears(or five yearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at\nprices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the\nexercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110%\nof the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest\nover four years.\n2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan\nIn May 2022, the Company's board of directors adopted the 2022 Inducement Equity Incentive Plan (the “Inducement\nPlan”), pursuant to which the Company reserved 9,760,000shares of Class A common stock to be used exclusively for\ngrants of equity-based awards to individuals who were not previously employees or directors of the Company, as a\nmaterial inducement to the individual’s entry into employment with the Company. The Inducement Plan permits the\ngrant of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, performance units and\nperformance shares. Shares that actually have been issued under the Inducement Plan under any award will not be\nreturned to the Inducement Plan and will not become available for future distribution under the Inducement Plan;\nhowever, if shares issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock, RSUs, performance shares or performance units are\nrepurchased by the Company or are forfeited to the Company due to failure to vest, such shares will become\navailable for future grant under the Inducement Plan. Shares used to pay the exercise price of an award or to\nsatisfy the tax withholding obligations related to an award will become available for future grant or sale under\nthe Inducement Plan. The exercise price, term, and any other terms and conditions of the options granted under the\nInducement Plan will be determined by the administrator of the plan.\nRSUs\nPrior to November 2020 , the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of both service-based and\nliquidity event-related performance vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards\ngenerally is satisfied over four years. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied\nupon the effectiveness of the IPO registration statement. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition\nwas achieved upon the effectiveness of the Company’s IPO, resulting in the Company recording cumulative stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 279million for IPO Vested RSUs. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining\nservice-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will be recorded\nover the remaining requisite service period. Since November 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award\ndiscussed below, the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition\nwhich is generally four years.\n111\nTable of Contents\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the day\nCompany’s IPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches\nthat are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share,\neach of which are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day trading period\nduring the performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if\nthe Company achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided\nthat Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\nThe Company recorded $ 12million, $ 112million and $ 112million of stock-based compensation expense related to the\nCEO Performance Award during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively. As of December 31,\n2022, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 177million.\n112\nTable of Contents\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 Plan, 2020 Plan and Inducement Plan was as follows (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                    Average\nShares       Weighted-    Remaining\nsubject to         Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nOptions        Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nOutstanding           Price    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December 31, 2021                     19,115    $       2.60                 4.59    $      2,797\nAssumed via acquisition                              1,710    $       4.11\nGranted                                                  —    $          —\nExercised                                           -4,780    $       2.30                                  451\nCancelled and forfeited                                -24    $       4.09\nBalance as of December 31, 2022                     16,021    $       2.84                 3.48    $        737\nExercisable as of December 31, 2022                 15,676    $       2.80                 3.47    $        721\nVested and expected to vest as of                   16,021    $       2.84                 3.48    $        737\nDecember 31, 2022\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock on the NYSE as of the respective\nperiod-end dates.

Key assumptions of the Black-Scholes valuation model are the risk-free interest rate, expected\nvolatility, expected term and expected dividends. The Company determined the expected term of assumed in the money\noption awards considering vesting provisions, the expected exercise behavior, and contractual term of the awards.\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues similar in duration\nto the expected term of the stock option awards. The Company developed the expected volatility using the average\nvolatility of its Class A common stock and the stocks of a peer group of similar publicly traded peer companies.\nThe Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring dividends on its common\nstock.\nThere were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, except for the options\nassumed via acquisition. The assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options assumed via acquisition\nfor the periods presented were as follows:\n113\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020                       2021      2022\nExpected volatility         —                          —       69.13%\nRisk-free rate              —                          —        2.29%\nDividend yield              —                          —            —\nExpected term (in years)    —                          —         1.69\nThe Company recorded stock-based compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations as follows (in\nmillions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021       2022\nCost of revenue, exclusive of             $                       31    $    46    $   102\ndepreciation and amortization\nSales and marketing                                               37         52         98\nResearch and development                                         171        182        365\nGeneral and administrative                                        83        206        313\nRestructuring charges                                              —          —         11\nTotal stock-based compensation expense    $                      322    $   486    $   889\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $ 12million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested\nstock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.77years.\nAs of December 31, 2022, there was $ 2.6billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to\nunvested restricted stock and RSUs, excluding the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the\nCEO Performance Award.

A\ntotal of 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock were initially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each\nfiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any)\noccurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of\nthe outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or\n(iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\nThe ESPP includes two components: a component that allows the Company to make offerings intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code and a component that allows the Company to make offerings not intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code to designated companies. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows\neligible employees to contribute (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the\nadministrator) an amount established by the administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A\ncommon stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2022, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such\nperiod will begin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n13.

It is not practicable to estimate the amount of\ndeferred tax liability related to investments in these foreign subsidiaries.\n115\nTable of Contents\nThe significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions):\nDecember 31,\nDeferred tax assets                                 2021         2022\nAccruals and reserves                    $           104    $     132\nStock-based compensation                              36           74\nTax credits carryforward                             237          209\nOperating lease liabilities                          101          115\nCapitalized research and development                   —          619\nNet operating loss carryforward                    1,050          660\nOther                                                  —           88\nTotal gross deferred tax assets                    1,528        1,897\nLess: Valuation allowance                         -1,398       -1,655\nTotal deferred tax assets net of                     130          242\nvaluation allowance\nDeferred tax liabilities\nProperty and equipment and intangible                -36         -134\nassets\nROU assets                                           -83          -94\nDeferred contract costs                              -15          -17\nTotal gross deferred tax liabilities                -134         -245\nNet deferred tax liabilities             $            -4    $      -3\nDuring 2022, the Company effectuated certain tax-planning actions which reduced the amount of net operating losses\ngenerated in 2021 by $ 2.4billion with a corresponding increase to other deferred tax assets which will reverse in\nfuture periods. These tax-planning actions did not result in additional income tax liability for 2021.\nThe Company accounts for deferred taxes under ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires a reduction of the carrying\namounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than\nnot that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax\nassets is assessed periodically based on the ASC 740 more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. This\nassessment considers matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future\ntaxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The evaluation of the recoverability of\nthe deferred tax assets requires that the Company weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion\nthat it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The\nweight given to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Due to the\nlack of earnings history, the Company's deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance, with\nthe exception of certain foreign jurisdictions. Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $ 97million, $\n1.0billion and $ 257million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2.1billion and $ 1.6billion, respectively. Of the $ 2.1billion of federal net operating losses, $ 2.0billion is\ncarried forward indefinitely. Of the $ 1.6billion of state net operating losses, $ 342million is carried forward\nindefinitely. The remaining federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2036 and\n2024, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n692million that begin to expire in 2025.\nThe Company also had $ 181million and $ 102million of federal and state research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards, respectively, as of December 31, 2022. The federal research and development tax credits expire in\nvarying amounts starting in 2033. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward\nindefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be limited\nin the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended, and similar state tax law. Based on the most recent analysis, the Company does not anticipate a current\nlimitation on the tax attributes.\n116\nTable of Contents\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2020       2021       2022\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                        7    $     7    $    69\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                                3         62         19\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                 -3          —        -19\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                        7    $    69    $    69\nThe Company had $ 69million of gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022, the majority of which would\nnot affect its effective tax rate if recognized due to the Company's valuation allowance. The majority of gross\nunrecognized tax benefits relate to income tax positions which, if recognized, would be in the form of additional\ndeferred tax assets that would be offset by a valuation allowance. The Company does not anticipate that the amount\nof unrecognized tax benefits relating to tax positions existing at December 31, 2022 will significantly increase or\ndecrease within the next 12 months.\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for income taxes, which were immaterial for the periods presented.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as\nforeign jurisdictions. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the\nattribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to\nthe extent utilized in a future period. The material jurisdictions in which the Company is subject to potential\nexamination include the United States and Finland. The Company’s 2016 and subsequent tax years remain open to\nexamination by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, 2017 and subsequent tax years remain open to examination in\nFinland.\n14. Net Loss per Share Attributable to DoorDash, Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock\nand participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common\nstock and Class B common stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and\nClass B common stock share equally in the Company’s net losses.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders during the periods presented. The shares issued in the IPO and the shares of Class A common stock\nissued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock in the IPO, as well as\nvested RSUs that have not been settled are included in the table below weighted for the period outstanding in the\nyears ended December 31, 2020, 2021 and 2022 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands,\nand per share data):\nYear Ended\nDecember 31,\n2020                        2021                        2022\nClass A       Class B       Class A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nNet loss\nincluding\nredeemable          $                -446    $      -15    $     -424    $      -44    $   -1,260    $     -108\nnon-controlling\ninterests\nLess: Net loss\nattributable to\nredeemable                              —             —             —             —            -3             —\nnon-controlling\ninterests\nNet loss\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.      $                -446    $      -15    $     -424    $      -44    $   -1,257    $     -108\ncommon\nstockholders\nWeighted-average\nnumber of shares\noutstanding used\nto compute net\nloss per\nshare                              60,422         1,968       305,500        31,347       342,015        29,398\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.\ncommon\nstockholders,\nbasic and\ndiluted\nNet loss per\nshare\nattributable to\nDoorDash, Inc.      $               -7.39    $    -7.39    $    -1.39    $    -1.39    $    -3.68    $    -3.68\ncommon\nstockholders,\nbasic and\ndiluted\n117\nTable of Contents\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is\ncontingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied at the end of the respective\nperiods (in thousands):\nAs of December 31,\n2020      2021      2022\nStock options to purchase common stock                  33,802    19,115    16,021\nUnvested restricted stock and restricted                28,366    27,518    45,172\nstock units\nConvertible promissory notes                             2,595         —         —\nEscrow shares                                                —         —     2,012\nTotal                                                   64,763    46,633    63,205\n15. Employee Benefit Plans\n401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion\nof their pretax earnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company did not make contributions for\neligible employees for any of the periods presented.\nDefined Benefit Plan\nEmployees based in Finland are covered under the Finnish Employees’ Pension Act (“TyEL”). TyEL is a statutory\nprivate sector pension act that is partly funded and paid through a pay-as-you-go pool. The Old-age Pension and\nDisability Pension benefits of TyEL are classified as postretirement benefits under defined benefit plan accounting\nstandards and based on an actuarial valuation. The Old-age Pension liability for active employees includes the\neffect of future salary increases. The Disability Pension liability for active employees is based on employees'\ntotal salary two years before the fiscal year.\nNet periodic benefit cost is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Service cost is\nreflected in total costs and expenses. Other components of net periodic benefit cost, including interest cost and\namortization of actuarial gains and losses, is included in other (expense) income, net. Actuarial gains and losses\nresulting from remeasurement are initially recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income and subsequently\nrecognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n16. Variable Interest Entities\nOn July 1, 2022, the Company formed a joint venture with a retail partner in Canada with the objective of providing\non-demand delivery of grocery and convenience items to customers in Canada (the \"JV\"). The Company owns a majority\ninterest in the JV.\nIn connection with the formation of the JV, the Company has committed to contribute cash and certain assets worth $\n98million Canadian dollars (approximately $ 74million US dollars) over three years. Upon the closing of the\ntransaction, the Company contributed cash and certain assets of $ 41million Canadian dollars (approximately $\n32million US dollars). Additional capital contributions will be made in a manner that preserves the ownership\npercentage of each shareholder.\nThe common units held by the Company in the JV were determined to be a variable interest. The Company is the\nprimary beneficiary because the Company has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the\nperformance of the JV. As a result, the Company consolidates the assets and liabilities of the JV.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the total assets and liabilities of the JV included on the consolidated balance sheets\nwere $ 68million and $ 17million respectively.\nThe JV’s assets may only be used to settle the JV’s obligations and may not be used for other consolidated\nentities. The JV’s liabilities are non-recourse to the general credit of the Company’s other consolidated entities.\nAs of December 31, 2022, the minority shareholder’s ownership in the JV is classified as redeemable non-controlling\ninterest, because it is redeemable on an event that is not solely in the Company’s control. The redeemable non-\ncontrolling\n118\nTable of Contents\ninterest is not accreted to redemption value because it is currently not probable that the non-controlling interest\nwill become redeemable. Total redeemable non-controlling interest was $ 14million as of December 31, 2022. Net loss\nattributable to redeemable non-controlling interest was $ 3million for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n17. Restructuring\nOn November 30, 2022, the Company committed to a reduction in workforce (the “Plan”) intended to better align the\nCompany’s talent with its strategic priorities and to improve operating efficiency. The Plan included the\nelimination of approximately 1,250positions across the Company, or approximately 7% of the Company’s current\nemployee workforce at such time. The Company expects that it will incur $ 82million in restructuring charges in\nconnection with the Plan, consisting of separation-related payments and other termination benefit costs.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recognized $ 82million in restructuring charges, consisting of\n$ 68million related to cash expenditures for separation-related payments, benefits, and related taxes, $ 17million\nin stock-based compensation related to equity compensation, which was partially offset by a $ 6million benefit\nrelated to the reversal of previously recognized stock-based compensation expenses for unvested stock awards, and $\n3million non-cash expense related to the acceleration of prepaid compensation for employees who were terminated.\nThese expenses are included in restructuring charges in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations, and\nunpaid amounts are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on its consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company expects that most cash payments and expenses related to the Plan will be completed by the end of the\nfirst quarter of 2023.\nThe following table summarizes the total amount incurred and accrued related to these restructuring activities (in\nmillions):\nWorkforce reduction costs\nAccrued restructuring as of January 1, 2022                                 —\nRestructuring charges incurred during the                                  82\nyear\nCash payments                                                             -17\nNon-cash settlements and other adjustments                                -14\nAccrued restructuring as of December 31, 2022    $                         51\nIn addition to the Plan described above, there were other restructuring charges of $ 10million arising from other\nrestructuring activities in 2022. As of December 31, 2022, the liabilities related to these restructuring\nactivities were immaterial.\n18. Subsequent Events\nIn February 2023, the Company announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of\nshares of Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $ 750million. This program is in addition to the prior\nrepurchase program for the repurchase of $ 400million shares of Class A common stock, which was completed in the\nthird quarter of 2022. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately\nnegotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors.\nOpen market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the\nExchange Act. The Company may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of\nour Class A common stock under this authorization. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on\na variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment\nopportunities.\n119\nTable of Contents",

Based on such evaluation, our certifying officers have concluded that\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management, under the oversight of our Board\nof Directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022\nbased on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring\nOrganizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final\nassessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition\noccurred. Our management's evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded Bbot, LLC (\"Bbot\") and\nWolt, which we acquired on March 1, 2022 and June 1, 2022, respectively. Total assets (excluding acquired goodwill\nand intangible assets) and total revenues related to Bbot and Wolt collectively represented approximately 5% and 4%\nof our consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over\nfinancial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation\npursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that\nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or\nour internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations\nof internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be\nprevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance\nthat the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact\nthat there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of\n120\nTable of Contents\ncompliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.
