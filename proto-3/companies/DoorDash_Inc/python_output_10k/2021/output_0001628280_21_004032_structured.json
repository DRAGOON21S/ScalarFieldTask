Our mission is to grow and empower local economies.\nTechnology has changed consumer behavior and driven a wave of demand for convenience. Consumers’ expectations of\nease and immediacy with every purchase has been a boon for some companies but damaging for many others. We enable\nlocal brick-and-mortar businesses—which are fundamental to the vitality of local economies and communities—to\naddress consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in an increasingly convenience-driven economy. Our\nlocal logistics platform connects over 450,000 merchants 1 , over 20 million consumers 2 , and over 1 million\nDashers 3 in the United States, Canada, and Australia every month.\nWe built our products to serve the needs of these three key constituencies. We do this primarily through the\nDoorDash Marketplace, or our Marketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve\nmission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment\nprocessing, and customer support. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand\ntheir reach. It generates significant demand for merchants by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants\ncan fulfill this demand through delivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by\nconsumers.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our business today, we offer merchants a\nvariety of products, which we refer to as merchant services, to facilitate sales that merchants have originated\nthrough their own channels. DoorDash Drive, or Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants that\nhave generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our local logistics\nplatform. DoorDash Storefront, or Storefront, enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering\nexperience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without\ninvesting in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nTHE DOORDASH PLATFORM\nOur local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. We built our local logistics platform to\nserve the needs of these three key constituencies and to become more intelligent and efficient with every order. As\nwe have grown, the scale of our local logistics platform has become one of our major competitive advantages and\ndelivers substantial benefits to everyone we serve. We connect:\nMerchants: Over 450,000 merchants run and grow their businesses using our technology platform. Our products are\ndesigned to meet the individual needs of merchants, regardless of their scale, business model, or location. Our\nMarketplace includes business enablement and demand fulfillment services that enable merchants to solve mission-\ncritical challenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment\nprocessing, and customer support. We help our merchants thrive in an increasingly convenience-driven economy while\nenabling them to focus on their craft.\nConsumers: Over 20 million consumers discover, engage with, and purchase goods from merchants on our local\nlogistics platform. For consumers, we offer the ability to order from the best of their communities with the click\nof a button and to have their orders reliably delivered or waiting at the store for pickup. We enable convenience\nfor consumers throughout their entire day, from breakfast pickup on-the-go to catered lunch at work to grocery or\ndinner delivery straight to their doorsteps. We believe that the convenient access we provide to an unmatched\n1 Based on the number of individual stores, including Drive stores, that have completed an order through our\nplatform in the past month, measured as of December 31, 2020.\n2 Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplace in the past\nmonth, measured as of December 31, 2020.\n3 Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past month,\nmeasured as of December 31, 2020.\n6\nTable o f Contents\ncombination of selection, experience, and value for consumers helps drive consumer engagement and category-leading\nspend retention. 4\nDashers: Over 1 million Dashers use our local logistics platform to find opportunities to earn. For Dashers, we\nprovide opportunities for those looking for a fast and flexible way to earn and to achieve their goals. We also\nprovide earnings transparency so that Dashers can make informed decisions about the deliveries they choose to make.\nDashers set their own schedules and we work to ensure that the time they spend making deliveries is well rewarded.\nWe do not require Dashers to deliver by car as they also have the option to deliver by bike or scooter, enabling a\nbroad range of people to deliver on our platform.\nOur local logistics platform benefits from three powerful virtuous cycles:\nLocal Network Effects: Our ability to attract more merchants, including local favorites and national brands,\ncreates more selection in our Marketplace, driving more consumer engagement, and in turn, more sales for merchants\non our platform. Our strong national merchant footprint enables us to launch new markets and quickly establish a\ncritical mass of merchants and Dashers, driving strong consumer adoption.\nEconomies of Scale: As more consumers join our local logistics platform and their engagement increases, our\nentire platform benefits from higher order volume, which means more revenue for local businesses and more\nopportunities for Dashers to work and increase their earnings. This, in turn, attracts Dashers to our local\nlogistics platform, which allows for faster and more efficient fulfillment of orders for consumers.\nIncreasing Brand Affinity: Both our local network effects and economies of scale lead to more merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our local logistics platform. As we scale, we continue to invest in improving\nour offerings for merchants, selection, experience, and value for consumers, and earnings opportunities for\nDashers. By improving the benefits of our local logistics platform for each of our three constituencies, our\nnetwork continues to grow and we benefit from increased brand awareness and positive brand affinity. With increased\nbrand affinity, we expect that we will enjoy lower acquisition costs for all three constituencies in the long term.\nSince our founding, over 1.2 billion orders have been completed through our platform. These orders inform our\nmachine learning algorithms and generate a data advantage in which the technology and value of our local logistics\nplatform is\n4 Edison Trends. Based on the estimated dollar value of orders placed on DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats by a\ngroup of users that first placed an order on any such platform between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2019, as\ndetermined by Edison Trends. For each platform, spend retention represents the total dollar value of orders placed\nby this group of users in their twelfth month on the platform as a percentage of the total dollar value of orders\nplaced by such group in their first month. Postmates is excluded due to inconsistent data availability in April and\nMay 2020; however, Postmates’ spend retention was lower than DoorDash in all other months of the measurement\nperiod.\n7\nTable o f Contents\ncontinuously enhanced as more constituencies are connected in our network and greater amounts of data are brought\ninto our platform. We leverage insights from this data to drive actionable recommendations for merchants regarding\nconsumer preferences and market trends. For example, as merchants think about growth and expansion, our data\ninsights can help guide their decisions on menu options, hours of operation, and where to build their next\nstorefront. Our data insights also give us unique visibility into the operations of the local businesses in our\nnetwork. For example, understanding the differences in kitchen preparation time for a sandwich versus sushi enables\nus to improve Dasher efficiency and improve the consumer experience. As more orders are completed on our local\nlogistics platform, our data insights grow and continue to enhance the experience for all three constituencies,\nwhich in turn strengthens our competitive advantage.\nOUR GROWTH STRATEGY\nWe intend to broaden our network of merchants by providing innovative services that help merchants operate and grow\ntheir businesses.\nMore merchants. We have experienced tremendous success serving merchants, primarily in the food vertical. We have\nover 450,000 merchants, the majority of which are restaurants, on our local logistics platform today, and there are\nmany more that we have yet to reach. We will continue to invest in our go-to-market strategy and sales efforts to\ncontinue adding new merchants. Over time, we plan to continue adding more merchants from verticals outside of food\nas well as DashMarts, our first party owned-and-operated convenience stores.\nMore merchant services. We provide a range of products and services, such as our Marketplace, Drive, and\nStorefront, to help our merchants operate and grow their businesses. We will continue to innovate and introduce new\nproducts and services to add value for our merchants and unlock additional revenue opportunities for DoorDash.\nWe seek to increase consumer adoption and have DoorDash become a daily activity.\nMore consumers. There are over 20 million consumers on our local logistics platform. We plan to continue to\nincrease our consumer reach, both in the United States and internationally. We launched in Australia, in September\n2019, and have a strong and growing business in Canada.\nMore consumer engagement. Today, consumers use our local logistics platform for a small fraction of their monthly\nmeals. In the food vertical, we strive to increase the frequency with which consumers use DoorDash by being the\nmost delicious, affordable, and convenient way to eat. We plan to do this by increasing the breadth of restaurant\nselection, expanding availability of meals at all times of the day, addressing the needs of business consumers via\nDoorDash for Work, which includes large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events, and enhancing\naffordability by increasing adoption of DashPass, our subscription product, which eliminates per-order delivery\nfees with partner merchants. We will also continue to seek partnership opportunities to extend the benefits of\nDashPass to more consumers. In addition, as we continue to add new verticals beyond food, we expect to further\nincrease the amount of consumer spend on our platform and broaden the benefits of DashPass.\nWe seek to build a reliable, high quality, and operationally efficient logistics network.\nBetter consumer experience. Our goal is to delight consumers, thereby promoting their use of our platform and\nmaking it easier for us to acquire new consumers. We continue to make investments aimed at improving the consumer\nexperience. We are particularly focused on building tools to help Dashers improve the accuracy of items delivered\nand the speed and timeliness of delivery, without sacrificing selection.\nBetter Dasher experience. We also invest in improving Dasher experience and satisfaction. This includes improving\nonboarding and enabling Dashers to sign up and start earning faster. For example, we developed our local logistics\nplatform to provide earnings visibility after every delivery in an easy and transparent manner, and through our\nFast Pay service, we enable Dashers to receive their earnings on-demand, rather than on a weekly basis.\nImprove operational efficiency. We are focused on optimizing our cost structure primarily through product\nimprovements meant to enhance the operational efficiency and quality of our local logistics platform. These\nimprovements include enhancements to our batching algorithms and order preparation and traffic predictions.\nOUR OFFERINGS\n8\nTable o f Contents\nOur offerings provide merchants, consumers, and Dashers with a local logistics platform that offers access to\nconvenience and opportunity.\nOfferings for Merchants\nWe have carefully designed our local logistics platform with a merchant-first approach. Our merchant services\ninclude business enablement and demand fulfillment services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical\nchallenges such as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and\ncustomer support. Our local logistics platform provides merchants with the mission-critical capabilities needed to\nmeet the demands of the convenience economy and capture the business growth that comes from this new wave of\ndemand.\nMerchant tablet and software portal. Partner merchants use our tablets and our merchant software portal for\nholistic views of their businesses. Our self-service capabilities enable merchants to directly onboard to our local\nlogistics platform and monitor their businesses in real time.\nMerchant services that we offer for demand fulfillment include:\nMarketplace. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach. It\ngenerates significant demand for merchants by connecting them with over 20 million consumers. Merchants can fulfill\nthis demand through delivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or by taking advantage of in-person\npickup or self-delivery, as described below. As part of our Marketplace, we also offer:\n◦ Pickup. Pickup allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with\nno consumer fees. We believe Pickup generates additional foot traffic for our merchants and drives incremental\nsales.\n◦ DoorDash for Work. DoorDash for Work provides our merchants with large group orders and catering orders for\nbusinesses and events. Merchants benefit from such orders due to their large dollar value, which helps drive\nprofitability, and the advance nature of such orders, which helps merchants plan better.\n◦ Self-Delivery. Self-Delivery enables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery\nfleets.\nDrive. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants to fulfill consumer demand that they have\nalready created through their own channels but do not have the in-house distribution capacity to fulfill. Many\nnational merchants, such as Chipotle, Wingstop, and Little Caesars, invest significant capital in building their\nown mobile applications and websites to enable consumers to interact with their brands and order online. These\nmerchants need the ability to address the off-premise consumer demand they have created without having to build and\nmanage their own logistics operations. Through Drive, merchants are able to connect with Dashers and leverage our\nlocal logistics platform to fulfill their orders.\nDoorDash Storefront. Storefront enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience,\nproviding them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-\nhouse engineering or logistics capabilities.\nOur Marketplace includes a variety of services, beyond demand fulfillment, that enable merchants’ businesses:\nCustomer acquisition. DoorDash connects merchants with over 20 million consumers. Merchants can also use DoorDash\nto initiate and run promotions to attract new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nConsumer engagement . We provide merchants with the tools to attract and engage consumers or win back consumers\nwho have not ordered from them recently. Merchants can also feature new items or details about their individual\nstores.\nMerchandising strategy and personalization. Our merchandising strategy allows us to feature certain merchants or\nproducts. For example, we often curate and feature “Local Picks” prominently to showcase new merchants or recent\ntrends. Our machine learning algorithms further personalize selection based on individual consumer order patterns\nand other factors.\nPayment processing. DoorDash handles payment acceptance from consumers primarily through a third-party payment\nprocessor that manages credit card transaction processing, which means merchants do not need to be concerned with\ncredit card authorization, chargebacks, or fraud. Partner merchants and Dashers have accounts directly with the\npayment processor and we remit payments to merchants and Dashers through the payment processor. When Dashers pick\nup from a non-partner merchant, they are authorized to pay for the purchased goods with a DoorDash-issued debit\ncard.\n9\nTable o f Contents\nSelf-service. Merchants are able to use the merchant software portal and our Merchant Tablet Order Manager to\nself-edit menus, update business hours and pricing, and provide additional information about their businesses.\nInsights and analytics. Our merchant software portal allows merchants to track business performance on a number\nof metrics, including how long a Dasher waits for an order, order accuracy, analyses on top-performing items, and\nreports on incremental sales. Merchants can use this information to more effectively manage their operational\nprocesses and inventory and price items at competitive rates. The data we track enables insights that help\nmerchants understand their consumer base, identify new ways to drive business, and improve the quality of the\ndelivery experience.\nCustomer support. We provide customer support for any orders placed through our local logistics platform. Our\ncustomer support centers address both order and logistics issues, and we work together with merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers to resolve disputes.\nIntegrations. DoorDash seamlessly integrates with merchants’ existing systems and workflows to streamline\noperations. Integration with merchant POS systems not only eliminates the need for merchants to monitor and\nmaintain a tablet but also helps improve the delivery experience. For example, merchants with POS integration\ngenerally experience a reduction in how long a Dasher waits for an order and the number of missing or incorrect\nitems in an order. We are also able to integrate into existing workflows through which merchants receive their\norders, including website, email, tablet, phone, and fax. We do this because we are a merchant-first company and\nstrive to integrate seamlessly with our merchants’ existing operational processes.\nOfferings for Consumers\nFor consumers, our local logistics platform serves as a search engine to the local economy. Our consumer offerings\nprovide a frictionless and personalized experience to search, discover, and order from local businesses. Both our\nconsumer mobile application and website help consumers decide what to order with relevant information about each\nmerchant, visually-rich photos, and filters to make it simple and efficient to find the right merchants and items.\nConsumer mobile application and website. Our consumer mobile application and website provide consumers with\naccess to a wide selection of merchants in our Marketplace. Consumers can search by delivery time, price, rating,\nand other categories (such as type of cuisine for restaurant merchants) to find the merchant and items that satisfy\ntheir needs. Consumers can also easily browse merchants around them to discover new merchants or goods that cater\nto their preferences. Our proprietary technology enhances the consumer experience by displaying merchants according\nto a consumer’s preferences and other factors such as delivery times and ratings. Our ability to serve consumers\nwith a personalized selection of merchants that reflects our understanding of their preferences allows us to enable\nthe discovery and curation of merchants for our consumers. We also enable consumers to place orders individually as\nwell as order as a group.\nOnce a merchant is selected, consumers can customize orders according to their preferences. Our mobile application\nand website provide real-time notifications and order tracking so that consumers can closely follow their orders\nfrom the moment they are placed to when they are delivered. We also offer consumers the ability to easily contact\nDashers, and vice-versa, to ensure a seamless delivery experience. Our local logistics platform also allows\nconsumers to easily contact our support team so that issues are efficiently resolved, which provides the ability\nfor us to turn a problem into an opportunity to engage and build loyalty with consumers.\nDashPass. Our subscription product, DashPass, serves as a membership program to the physical world and offers\nconsumers unlimited access to eligible merchants with $0 delivery fees and reduced service fees on eligible orders.\nDashPass currently costs $9.99 per month for a monthly membership. DashPass enables us to reward our most engaged\nconsumers with savings on the cost of delivery and to reward DashPass-eligible merchants by featuring them to our\nmost engaged consumers.\nPickup . Pickup allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines and save time, and pick up items directly\nfrom the merchant.\nOfferings for Dashers\nUnderpinning our offerings for Dashers is our proprietary technology that enables Dashers to work where, when, and\nhow they want while keeping them busy so they can earn more money in less time.\nWe enable Dashers to easily sign up anytime and anywhere . After clearing a background check, new Dashers can\nquickly and easily onboard onto our local logistics platform. We place great value on flexibility and provide\nDashers with a choice to either visit a local office for personal assistance or stay in the comfort of their own\nhome to onboard wherever they are.\n10\nTable o f Contents\nTransparency for Dashers . Through the dedicated Dasher mobile application, DoorDash strives to offer Dashers\nwith transparency, including critical information regarding deliveries upfront such as guaranteed earnings,\nestimated time and distance, merchant name, and consumer drop-off information.\nProprietary technology to optimize Dasher efficiency. We have developed proprietary technology to optimize Dasher\nefficiency, which keeps Dashers busy and increases their earnings potential. Based on forecasted demand, our\nalgorithms predict the ideal number of Dashers needed in a given location at a given time. This helps balance the\nsupply of Dashers with consumer demand and keeps Dashers busy when they are using our local logistics platform.\nAdditionally, our algorithms contribute to a reduction in wasted time on a delivery and the improvement of Dasher\nefficiency in a variety of ways, including through smarter dispatching based on specific order preparation times\nand order batching. These technologies are vital as they improve Dasher efficiency and therefore the amount Dashers\ncan earn and the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform.\nSALES AND MARKETING\nMarketing\nThe strength of our local logistics platform and the benefits that accrue to merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nserve as our most effective marketing tool. This has helped us generate strong organic merchant, consumer, and\nDasher growth through word-of-mouth since our earliest days. We also employ paid marketing efforts to attract and\nretain additional merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nWith merchants, we collaborate on co-marketing campaigns to promote our local logistics platform through their in-\nstore collateral,television campaigns, and other digital marketing efforts. In addition, we will also co-create\nnational and regional promotional campaigns with partner merchants that drive consumer demand to our Marketplace\nand generate significant press coverage—which in turn increases brand affinity and keeps both us and our partner\nmerchants top of mind with consumers.\nWe employ referral campaigns as well as online and offline marketing channels to attract new consumers and Dashers\nto our local logistics platform. Our online and offline channels include search engine marketing, display\nadvertising, social media, streaming audio,direct mail, television, and billboards. When we acquire a new consumer\nor Dasher, we often provide promotions or incentives to demonstrate our value proposition to them early on in their\nlife cycle.\nSales\nWe utilize both inside sales and field sales teams to grow our merchant base in the United States, Canada, and\nAustralia. A growing portion of our merchant acquisition funnel is also self-serve. Through our self-serve channel,\nmerchants can sign up and onboard directly via our website.\nOur account management team supports our sales efforts. This team onboards merchants, drives adoption of our new\nofferings and services, such as DashPass, Drive, or Pickup, based on a merchant’s evolving business needs, and\noptimizes logistics operations. Our account management team is responsible for ensuring the continued success of\nmerchants on our local logistics platform.\nHUMAN CAPITAL AND EMPLOYEES\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had 3,886 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our\nemployees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our\nemployee relations are strong.\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values\nthat we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\nAt DoorDash we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the\nfuture—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid\ninnovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\n11\nTable o f Contents\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nAt DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the\ncities we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the\ntalent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the\nvoices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the tools, resources,\nand opportunities to succeed.\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\nElevate\nElevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company.\nThe year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership\nteam, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.\nWomen’s Leadership Forum\nOur Women’s Leadership Forum equips mid- to senior-level technical women with skills to thrive in our workplace.\nThis six-month program happens once a year and includes classroom-style learning, one-on-one coaching, and group\nroundtables. Members of our management team actively participate in the forum.\nEmployee Resource Groups\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (ERGs), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We\ncurrently have six ERGs: Hue (employees of color), Black@DoorDash, Latinx@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash\n(LGBTQIA+), and Parents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.\nSMASH\nWe partner with the non-profit, SMASH, to host underrepresented college and college-bound students in STEM\n(science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) during the summer. The students work closely with our\nengineering and product teams to develop and present solutions to various product design challenges.\nCOMPETITION\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the\nfollowing criteria:\nMerchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our\nbusiness enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the scale\nof our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services that\nenable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.\nConsumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors. We believe that we are positioned favorably\nbecause we provide consumers with convenient access to our unmatched combination of merchant selection, experience,\nand value.\nDashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors including flexibility and earnings\npotential. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the density of our network, the improving\nefficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive.\nIn the United States, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Grubhub\n(pending acquisition by Just Eat Takeaway), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that\nhave their own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems such as Toast\nand ChowNow, other merchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery\nservices, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to\nexpand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In\naddition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper\nmenus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to\nattract consumers. With Drive, and as we\n12\nTable o f Contents\ncontinue to expand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete with large Internet companies\nwith substantial resources, users and brand power, such as Amazon and Google.\nWe believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution\nhave allowed us to quickly extend our network and our geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to\nexpand within our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information\nabout the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our\nBusiness and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.”\nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\nWe believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks,\npatents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements,\nconfidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment\nagreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual\nprotections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and\nfrequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual\nproperty in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31,\n2020, we had 25 issued U.S. patents, 41 U.S. patent applications pending, and 14 patent applications pending in a\nforeign jurisdiction. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of\nnew intellectual property.\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names\nand product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine\nappropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2020, we held 34 registered trademarks in the United States and\n48 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous\npending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered\ndomain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and\ncost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the\nfuture or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled\n“Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third\nparties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of\noperations, and reputation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately\nprotect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.”\nGOVERNMENT REGULATION\nWe are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws,\nregulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, commissions and fees,\nanti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product\nliability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, subscription services, intellectual property,\nconsumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data security, competition, unionizing and\ncollective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application\nand website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. The sale and delivery of goods through our\nplatform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety, alcohol, tobacco,\ncannabidiol, pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, hazardous substances, and the interstate and intrastate\ntransport of goods. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due\nto their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time\nthrough judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,\nsuch as federal, state, and local administrative agencies.\nSee the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and\nRegulatory Environment—If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected,” “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Legal and\nRegulatory Environment—Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, many of which are\nunsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or\notherwise\n13\nTable o f Contents\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations,” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to\nOur Dependence on Third Parties—We primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made by\nconsumers and payments made to merchants and Dashers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third\nparty and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected,” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to\nour business associated with such laws and regulations.\nCORPORATE INFORMATION\nWe were incorporated in 2013 as Palo Alto Delivery Inc., a Delaware corporation.

You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\npart or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nmaintain or increase profitability in the future;\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nIf Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, or if we fail to comply with Proposition 22\nin the State of California, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely\naffected;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and any failure by them to maintain their\nservice levels or any changes to their operating costs could adversely affect our business;\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business;\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and the\ncosts of complying with such laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue,\nTotal Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline\nas a result of a widespread COVID-19 vaccine rollout;\nWe identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify additional\nmaterial weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, which may\nresult in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail to meet our periodic\nreporting obligations;\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment;\nand\n15\nTable o f Contents\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy, or the Voting\nAgreement, between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang, or our Co-Founders, has the effect of concentrating voting\npower with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, which will limit\nyour ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election\nof our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the\napproval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate\ntransaction. Future issuances of our Class C common stock, if any, will not dilute the voting control of Mr. Xu,\nbut will dilute his economic interest which could cause his interests to conflict with your interests. Further, the\nissuance of shares of Class C common stock, whether to Mr. Xu or to other stockholders, could prolong the duration\nof Mr. Xu’s voting control.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets and geographies;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased\nusage, as well as the deployment of new features and services;\nhire, integrate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may\nnot be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nWe have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced\nby growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding\nthese risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do\nnot address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nmaintain or increase profitability in the future.\nAlthough we generated net income of $23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, we have incurred net\nlosses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nmaintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $204 million, $667 million, and $461\nmillion in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2019, and 2020,\nwe had an accumulated deficit of $1.2 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. We expect our costs will increase\nover time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our\nbusiness and operating as a public company. We\n16\nTable o f Contents\nhave expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on developing our\nplatform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features and services,\nexpanding into new markets and geographies, and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be\nmore costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our business. Any failure to\nincrease our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from\nmaintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our Restricted Stock Units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increases in our expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2020, we\nhave $1.1 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity\nawards. Additionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs. For more information, see “—We have\nexpended and intend to expend substantial funds to satisfy a portion of our tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise in connection with the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs, which may have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have also implemented “sell-to-cover” in\nwhich shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf of RSU holders upon vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result in dilution to our\nstockholders.”\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\nlosses in the future and may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our recent revenue growth rate and financial\nperformance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. For the years ended December 31, 2018,\n2019 and 2020, our revenue was $291 million, $885 million, and $2.9 billion, respectively, representing a 204% and\n226% year-over-year growth rate, respectively. In addition, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a\nsignificant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. The circumstances that have accelerated the\ngrowth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a\nwidespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth\nrates to decline in future periods. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous\nquarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business\nmetrics growth in future periods. In particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods. We expect\nour revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate over the short term and decline in the long term. Our revenue\ngrowth rate may decline in future periods as the size of our business grows and as we achieve higher market\nadoption rates. We may also experience declines in our revenue growth rate as a result of a number of factors,\nincluding slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nthat utilize our platform, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to\ncontinue to capitalize on growth opportunities, increasing regulatory costs, and the maturation of our business,\namong others. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business,\nwhich may not result in increased revenue or growth. In addition, we have strategically focused on suburban markets\nand smaller metropolitan areas since our founding because of the opportunity that these markets have presented for\nour local logistics platform. If the demand for local logistics platforms does not continue to grow in these\nmarkets, or if we are unable to maintain our category share in these markets, our revenue growth rate could be\nadversely affected. If our revenue growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading\nprice of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United\nStates, we compete with other local food delivery logistics companies, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub (pending\nacquisition by Just Eat Takeaway), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have\ntheir own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems such as Toast and\nChowNow, other merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, and\ncompanies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand our\npresence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In addition, we\ncompete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that\nmerchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local\n17\nTable o f Contents\npublications to attract consumers. Changing traditional ordering habits is difficult, and if merchants and\nconsumers do not embrace the transition to local food delivery logistics as we expect, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and larger existing user bases in certain markets, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. Greater financial\nresources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly to new or\nemerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less\nattractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic\nmarket, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and\nsupply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less\nappealing to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic\nrelationships among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, Uber acquired Postmates in\nDecember 2020, Just Eat Takeaway, a European local logistics platform, announced that it has entered into a\ndefinitive agreement to acquire Grubhub, and Lyft announced a partnership with Grubhub that allows Lyft’s loyalty-\nprogram members free delivery from Grubhub restaurants. In addition, certain of our competitors have acquired\nkitchens to enable them to produce and deliver food directly to consumers. Our competitors could also introduce new\nofferings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns\nthan ours. Additionally, many of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant\ncommission rates and consumer fees, incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services and\nconsumer discounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, which may be\nmore attractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our\ncommission rates and fees or maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions in order to remain\ncompetitive, particularly in markets where we do not have a leading position. Such efforts have negatively\naffected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such\nefforts will be successful. Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a\nwide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly\ncapitalized. These investments, along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our\ncompetitors to continue to lower their prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they\noffer, and compete more effectively against us. Delivery logistics services for food and the other verticals in\nwhich we compete are nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that\nwill allow us to maintain or increase profitability. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may\ncompete with large Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and\nGoogle. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost-effective to develop their own platforms to offer\nonline pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIn addition, within our industry, the cost to switch between offerings is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift\nto the lowest-cost provider and could use more than one local logistics platform, independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local logistics platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may\nadopt certain of our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more\nhighly than ours, which would render our platform less attractive and reduce our ability to differentiate our\nplatform. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from\nthe use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow\nour platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in\nnew markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers\nattracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or than it has grown\nin the past. In\n18\nTable o f Contents\nparticular, our national brand partnerships are a key component of our strategy to provide a wide selection for\nconsumers. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our\nnational brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. In addition, we expect to\ncontinue to incur substantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations\ninto new markets to acquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive\nenvironments, and we may invest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will\nnot be achieved for several years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers\nwe acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Based on the type of partner agreement, partner merchants may generally\nterminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do\nnot generally provide for any exclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with\nus, the merchant selection available on our local logistics platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our\nbusiness and to our relationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain\nother constituencies For example, the increased growth of our subscription product, DashPass, and how compelling\nthis offering is to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to DashPass. Additionally, many\nof our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and other\nreduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such consumers, thereby\nencouraging them to access our platform regularly or subscribe as a paid user of DashPass, through prompts and\nnotifications and time-limited trials of DashPass and other offerings. However, these consumers may never convert\nto a paid subscription to DashPass or access our platform after they take advantage of our promotions. If we are\nnot able to continue to expand our consumer base or fail to convert our consumers to regular paying consumers,\ndemand for our full-price or paid services, such as DashPass, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or\ndecline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites\nand applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and\napplications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If\nconsumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than\nthrough our website and consumer mobile application directly, our ability to establish relationships and build\nbrand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized\nexperience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract\nand retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. To attract and retain\nDashers, we have, among other things, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, such as credits to be used for\norders on our platform, free DoorDash-branded apparel, and access to Dasher Experience Centers where Dashers can\nreceive assistance with pressing issues, meet other Dashers, and participate in special events. If we do not\ncontinue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income, and other\nincentive programs that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, we may fail to attract new Dashers\nor retain existing Dashers or increase their use of our platform. For example, if merchants and consumers choose to\nuse competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived\nutility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We also frequently test Dasher\nincentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and\nretain Dashers or fail to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have other unintended adverse\nconsequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment\nlaws, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or\nhigher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our control, such as increases in the price of\ngasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our\nplatform by Dashers. Our agreements with Dashers generally remain in effect until terminated by Dashers or us.\nDashers may generally terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven days advance\n19\nTable o f Contents\nnotice and such agreements do not provide for any exclusivity. If we fail to attract Dashers or retain existing\nDashers on favorable terms, if we fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, or if Dashers\nterminate their agreements with us, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, either as a result of increased\noperating costs, or to offset the commission we charge, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon merchants on our platform, including small and local independent businesses, to provide quality goods\nto our consumers at expected price points. If these merchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand,\nproducing quality goods at affordable prices, or meeting our other requirements or standards, or experience\nproblems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, our reputation and brand could be damaged. Further, an\nincrease in merchant operating costs could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission\nrates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our operational costs and efficiency, and if\nmerchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide\nconsumers with sufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform.\nMany of the factors affecting merchant operating costs, including off-premise costs and prices, are beyond the\ncontrol of merchants and include inflation, costs associated with the goods provided, labor and employee benefit\ncosts, rent costs, and energy costs. If merchants pass along these increased operating costs and increase prices on\nour platform, order volume may decline. Additionally, some merchants choose to charge higher prices on our platform\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nour business mix between Marketplace and Drive;\nthe proportion of consumers that subscribe to DashPass;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe seasonality of our business, particularly with respect to local food delivery logistics, including the effect\nof academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nthe impact of weather on our business;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\n20\nTable o f Contents\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe attraction and engagement of qualified employees and key personnel;\nour ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service providers;\nthe effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;\nthe effect the widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has on consumer behavior and our order volumes;\nthe impact that price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms imposed by various jurisdictions, and\nany associated increase in the fees we charge to consumers, have on our operating results;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems\nare not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our\nbusiness interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions\nin our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time\nto time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These\nsystem failures generally occur either as a result of software updates being deployed with unexpected errors or as\na result of temporary infrastructure failures related to storage, network, or compute capacity being exhausted.\nThese events have resulted in losses in revenue, though such losses have not been material to date. System failures\nin the future could result in significant losses of revenue. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided\ncredits to consumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar\nevent, including for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may\nvoluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, the affected user could seek monetary recourse\nfrom us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to\naddress. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the\navailability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and\ncould result in the loss of users.\n21\nTable o f Contents\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total\nOrders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline as a\nresult of a successful COVID-19 vaccine rollout.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has globally resulted in loss of life, business closures, restrictions on travel,\nand widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business\nwill depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including:\nnew information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease;\nthe duration and spread of the outbreak;\nthe severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary\nbusiness closures;\nregulatory actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant\npricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings;\nother business disruptions that affect our workforce;\nthe availability of effective vaccines and the speed at which they can be administered to the public;\nthe continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19;\nthe impact on capital and financial markets; and\nactions taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or\ntreat its impact.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken active measures to promote health and safety, including\nproviding for no-contact delivery, distributing masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to Dashers in affected areas, and\nworking closely with merchants to share safety guidelines. However, our efforts may not be successful and we may\nnot have sufficient protection or recovery plans to continue to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public\nhealth threats in the future. In connection with public health threats, we may also be required to temporarily\nclose our corporate offices and have our employees work remotely, as we have done in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic, which impacts productivity and otherwise disrupts our business operations. In addition, the current\noutbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and\nfinancial markets, and similar public health threats could do so in the future. Such events have impacted, and\ncould in the future impact, demand for merchants and consumer purchase patterns, which in turn, could adversely\naffect our revenue and results of operations.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace\nGOV due to increased consumer demand for delivery, more merchants using our platform to facilitate both delivery\nand take-out, and improved efficiency of our local logistics platform. The circumstances that have accelerated the\ngrowth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a\nwidespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth\nrates to decline in future periods.\nFurthermore, if a virus or other disease is transmitted by human contact, as is the case with COVID-19, our\nemployees and any constituent of our network may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid any\ncontact with others, any of which may adversely affect our ability to provide our platform and for merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers to use our platform. In addition, shelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact\nmerchants’ ability to operate their businesses, consumers’ ability to pick up orders, and Dashers’ ability to make\ndeliveries during certain times, or at all. Further, demand from businesses that typically place large orders for\ntheir employees or in-person meetings may be significantly reduced. With the COVID-19 pandemic, our DoorDash for\nWork offering has been limited to providing large group orders solely to businesses that are deemed essential and\nwe have also temporarily paused catering orders. Such events have in the past caused, and may in the future cause,\na temporary closure of merchants’ businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary preventative measures,\nand many of our merchants may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their businesses, and may be\nforced to go out of business. Even if merchants are able to continue to operate their businesses, many may operate\nwith limited hours, menus, and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or disruptions or closures of\nmerchants’ businesses could impact the selection available on our platform, disrupt our ability to operate our\nlocal logistics platform, and adversely affect our business.\n22\nTable o f Contents\nEven if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived\nrisk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Merchants may be perceived as\nunsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our\nplatform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar\npublic health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform\nwould be adversely affected. Any negative impact on consumers’ willingness or ability to order delivery or complete\na Pickup order, or on Dashers’ willingness or ability to make deliveries, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely\nto also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms will\nhave an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic, jurisdictions across the United States, including Washington, Massachusetts, jurisdictions within Los\nAngeles County, California, San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, have implemented\ntemporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative proposals\nto make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be\nmade. While several jurisdictions initially proposed permanent price controls but then implemented temporary price\ncontrols, other jurisdictions may implement permanent price controls in the future . These price controls have had\nin the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These price\ncontrols have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers, though we\nare aware of two jurisdictions that have adopted limits or explicit prohibitions against doing so in connection\nwith price controls. An increase in the fees we charge to consumers could result in reduced demand for our services\nby consumers. With the continued duration of COVID-19, we expect these existing price controls to persist in the\nnear term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If any of these\nevents occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory scrutiny or\naction may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which creates\nadditional challenges to managing our business. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer,\nlower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that\nenable them to attract or retain new merchants, consumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be no\nassurance that we will not be forced, through competition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of\ndelivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform, or further reduce the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have launched, and may in the future\nlaunch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as subscription products like DashPass, and Dasher or consumer\nloyalty programs, or modify existing pricing methodologies, any of which may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers. Further, our consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by\ngeographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these\nlocations. In particular, our continued international expansion may require us to change our pricing strategies and\nto adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing and gratuities. While we do and\nwill attempt to set prices based on our prior operating experience and merchant, consumer, and Dasher feedback and\nengagement levels, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing\nand we could be underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the services on our platform change, then\nwe may need to revise our pricing methodologies.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay model for Dashers.\nOur pay model for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to\nlead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under our former\nDasher pay model, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little\nor no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile,\nit also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being\nreceived by Dashers. Government authorities have also brought claims against us related to our former Dasher pay\nmodel and may bring similar claims in the future. For example, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed\nan action in the Superior\n23\nTable o f Contents\nCourt of the District of Columbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection Procedures\nAct with respect to our former Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent order and\njudgment to resolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former Dasher pay model from other\ngovernment authorities in the future.\nThe incorrect understanding or perception of our former Dasher pay model by some led, and may continue to lead, to\nsome consumers providing lower tips, or no tips at all, to Dashers, which could impact the amount that Dashers are\nable to earn on our platform and our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We have also launched, and may in the\nfuture launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that utilize our platform, which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers. For example, in September 2019, we changed our Dasher\npay model to include (i) a base pay amount for each order, which depends on the estimated time, distance, and\ndesirability of the order, (ii) promotions for orders that meet certain conditions, including bonuses for Dashers\nwho meet specific goals, and (iii) tips from consumers, which Dashers receive 100% of on top of base pay and\npromotions. The base pay amount, any promotions, and any tips that the consumer chooses to include at checkout are\nshown to Dashers when they are offered a delivery.\nWe increased the amount we pay to Dashers per order when we changed to our current pay model, but our current\nDasher pay model may also cause less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some cases. Further, this pay\nmodel may lead to negative publicity related to perceptions of the complexity of the pay model, inconsistency in\nearnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the future, based on a variety of\nfactors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may change our pay model again. Our current pay model, and any\nfuture changes to our pay model or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an\nincrease to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain\nconsumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that\nDashers may be reclassified as employees under federal or state law. As discussed further below, we have been\ninvolved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such\nproceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West,\nInc. v. Superior Court , or Dynamex, including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June\n2020. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test\nset forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which\nwas signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5\ncodified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous\ncarve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for a 2020 ballot initiative, or\nProposition 22, to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020\nand went into effect in December 2020. Under Proposition 22, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with\ncertain other requirements, are now applicable to us and Dashers in California and our costs related to Dashers\nhave increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we will in certain circumstances charge\nhigher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time and adversely impact our results\nof operations. In addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation\nthat would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in\nongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work\nthat Dashers perform. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related\nto Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if\nwe charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, and our results of operations would be adversely\nimpacted. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could\nstill be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, on January 12, 2021, certain plaintiffs filed a writ\npetition with the Supreme Court of California challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22. On February 3,\n2021, the Court denied the writ petition without prejudice, but on February 11, 2021, plaintiffs re-filed their\nclaim in California Superior Court and similar challenges may also be filed. In addition, we could face further\nchallenges to the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors as other states\nwhere we operate are considering adopting similar legislation or regulations. A reclassification of Dashers or\ndelivery service providers using a local logistics platform as employees could require us to revise our pricing\nmethodologies and pay model to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other substantive\ninternal adjustments to account for any transition of a Dasher to an employment position, which would have an\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\n24\nTable o f Contents\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our\ngoals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term.\nThese decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the\nlong-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. For example,\nEmployee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquarters and in a number of our offices across the\nUnited States and internationally. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on\nmanagement and our operational and financial infrastructure. For example, in connection with the audit of our\nconsolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent\nregistered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in errors in\nour consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could\ncause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and\nfinancial infrastructure in order to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of\noperations.\nAs with many companies in our growth stage, a majority of our employees have been with us for fewer than 24 months.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and\nfinancial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new\nemployees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge our ability to\ndevelop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and\nprocedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if\nwe do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and the\nefficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more\nimportant as competition in our industry further intensifies. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing\nour reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the success of our\nmarketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our ability to\nsuccessfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” mark, our logo, and other trademarks\nimportant to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe\nthat our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives\nnew consumer growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our\nconsumers have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local logistics platforms and\nservices, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our consumer base, we must appeal\nto new consumers who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local logistics\nplatforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Negative\nperception of our platform or company may harm our reputation, brand, and local network effects, including as a\nresult of:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and\nguidelines, including Dasher pay;\n25\nTable o f Contents\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nfraud;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or to pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission, or not clearly articulated;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but\nnegatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance\nthe interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely\naffect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, pay\nmodel, user support, technology, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues, privacy or security\npractices, management team or the safety of Dashers, merchants and consumers using our platform could adversely\naffect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and\nloyalty of merchants, consumers, and\n26\nTable o f Contents\nDashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which Dashers\nwere compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general food\nsafety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers and merchants using our platform, which\nhas adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to scale and public awareness of our\nbrand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an amplified negative effect on our\nreputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands or influencers that we have partnered\nwith may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to us. Any negative publicity that we\nmay receive could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our brand, and adversely affect\nour reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive\nand proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary\ninformation relating to our business, such as our own proprietary information and personal data relating to our\nemployees. An increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses,\nother large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of\ntheir information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved\nsophisticated and highly targeted attacks. In addition, these incidents could originate on our vendors’ platforms,\nvendors' systems, or with our vendors’ personnel, which could then be leveraged to access our website and\nplatforms. We have previously experienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in September\n2019, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors that resulted in the unauthorized acquisition of certain\nDashers’ driver licenses as well as data related to certain of our consumers. This incident has resulted in\nregulatory inquiries and is the subject of litigation. To date, this incident has not resulted in a material loss\nof revenue or the incurrence of material expenses. We have undertaken steps to enhance our data security and\ngovernance program, which include adding additional protective security layers around the data, improving security\nprotocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside expertise to increase our ability to identify\nand repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and\nremediated or will not lead to recurrence or similar incidents. While we maintain cyber insurance that may help\nprovide coverage for these types of incidents, we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover\ncosts and liabilities related to this incident.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and\nmay not be known until launched against us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a\ntimely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we may face delays in our detection or remediation\nof, or other responses to, security breaches and other privacy- and security-related incidents. Unauthorized\nparties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities used in our\nbusiness through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, attempting to fraudulently induce our employees,\nmerchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information,\nor other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology, or IT, systems, or\nattempting to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, or others into manipulating payment information,\nresulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors.\nIn addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to\nour systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches\nexperienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are\nbecoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to\nidentify and prevent. We have previously experienced incidents of fraud on our platform that we believe involve\ncredential stuffing attacks, which we have been unable to detect or prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored\nor supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect,\nremediate, and otherwise respond to.\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect the personal data of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, protect our systems, prevent data loss, and prevent other\nsecurity breaches and security incidents, these security measures have not fully protected our systems in the past\nand cannot guarantee security in the future. The IT and infrastructure used in our business may be vulnerable to\ncyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access data, including personal data and other\nsensitive and proprietary data of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, our employees’ personal data, or our other\nsensitive and proprietary data, accessible through those systems. Employee error, malfeasance, or other errors in\nthe storage, use, or transmission of any of these types of data could result in an actual or perceived privacy or\nsecurity breach or other\n27\nTable o f Contents\nsecurity incident. Although we have policies restricting the access to the personal information we store, there is\na risk that these policies may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy, or any\nactual or perceived security breach or other incidents, could interrupt our operations, result in our platform\nbeing unavailable, result in loss or improper access to, or acquisition or disclosure of, data, result in\nfraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, damage our relationships with\nthird-party partners, or result in claims, regulatory investigations, and proceedings and significant legal,\nregulatory, and financial exposure, including ongoing monitoring by regulators, and any such incidents or any\nperception that our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence\nin, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy or security, or other security incident, impacting\nany entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers)\ncould have similar effects. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived security and privacy breaches and\nother incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole\nand, as a result, reduce confidence in us. We also expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and\nprevent privacy and security breaches and other privacy- and security-related incidents, and we may face increased\ncosts and requirements to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived privacy or security\nbreach or other incident.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their\nmerit, could be costly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be\nadequate for data handling or data security costs or liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to\nbe available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any\nfuture claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance\ncoverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of\nlarge deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nThe markets for local food delivery logistics and our other delivery logistics services are still in relatively\nearly stages of growth, and if these markets do not continue to grow, grow slower than we expect, or fail to grow\nas large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe local food delivery logistics market has grown rapidly since we launched our local logistics platform in 2013,\nbut it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at\nall. In addition, the market for the other delivery logistics services we facilitate, such as grocery delivery\nservices, is also relatively nascent, and it is uncertain whether demand for grocery delivery services or other\ndelivery logistics services we may facilitate in the future will continue to grow and achieve wide market\nacceptance, if at all. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt\nlocal food delivery logistics and the other delivery logistics services we facilitate. If the public does not\nperceive these services as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding safety,\naffordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’\nplatforms or otherwise, or instead adopts alternative solutions that may arise, then the market for our platform\nmay not further develop, may develop slower than we expect, or may not achieve the growth potential we expect, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers or the\nactivities of Dashers while making deliveries to our consumers, have occurred, and in the future may occur, which\ncould adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities\ninclude food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, assault, battery,\ntheft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering\nDasher accounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such\nactivities may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business\ninterruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to\nbackground checks, fraud by employees relating to payments on our platform, attempted payments by consumers with\ninsufficient funds, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers of Dasher accounts\nby bad actors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal\ninformation, such as unauthorized\n28\nTable o f Contents\nuse of another person’s identity, account information, or payment information and unauthorized acquisition or use\nof credit or debit card details, bank account information, and mobile phone numbers. For example, bad actors have\ncreated Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal identifying information to commit fraud on our\nplatform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, this has caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to\nindividuals who are not performing services as Dashers. We have launched a series of initiatives and products\nchanges to help prevent this practice.\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit\ncard data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we\nhave taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot\nguarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to\nadequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nactivities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivity by these parties from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through\nlitigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we have deactivated\nfrom our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform deliveries. At\nthe same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check, are too restrictive and\ninadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable\nto implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the\ngrowth and engagement of the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be\nadversely affected. In addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal,\nimproper, or otherwise inappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which\nenables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are\nretained directly by merchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in\nany of the other activities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on our platform. Further,\nany negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our\ncompetitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a\nwhole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory\nor litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which includes facilitating deliveries to consumers\nfrom non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less operationally\nefficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner merchants’\nsystems. For example, for orders with most partner merchants, Dashers have an expedited checkout process that does\nnot require a separate payment in store, but for orders with non-partner merchants, Dashers may have to place and\npay for the order separately in store. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each\norder, more time and manual processes needed to place each order, and a higher likelihood of errors. Further, we\nsometimes unintentionally incorrectly price non-partner goods on our platform as a result of inaccuracies that\noccur when capturing menu prices. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated\nwith facilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and\ncause damage to our reputation and brand. While our goal is to convert non-partner merchants into partner\nmerchants, our inability to do so at a sufficiently high rate, or at all, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, some non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed.\nWhile we honor these requests, removing non-partner merchants impacts our ability to provide a broad selection of\nmerchants. In addition, there is a risk that non-partner merchants bring legal claims against us relating to their\ninclusion on our platform. For example, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair\ncompetition, among other claims, and sought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. There is\nalso a risk that state or local law is enacted to prevent platforms like ours from including non-partners on the\nplatform. For example, the California Legislature passed legislation, California Assembly Bill 2149, or AB 2149,\nwhich was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and became effective on January 1, 2021. AB 2149 prohibits,\namong other things, food delivery logistics platforms from facilitating deliveries from restaurants in California\nwithout the restaurants’ prior consent. Similar prohibitions have also been enacted in Louisiana, Massachusetts,\nMichigan, Denver, Colorado, and Tucson, Arizona and are being contemplated in other jurisdictions. Beyond\nregulatory restrictions, we may also adopt internal policies that limit or prohibit the facilitation of deliveries\nfrom merchants without their prior consent. For example, in November 2020, we\n29\nTable o f Contents\nadopted internal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our\nplatform in the United States and such policies require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner\nrestaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with\nDoorDash. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may continue to\nrevise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we\nare required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this will adversely affect our ability to\nattract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsite and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail\nto expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance\nand improve our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely\naffected. If competitors introduce new offerings embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices emerge, our existing technology, services, website, and mobile applications may become obsolete. Our\nfuture success could depend on our ability to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and\npractices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to our platform and new services on our platform may involve significant technical risks and\nupfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively,\nor we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced\nplatform features and services or if our recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our\nexpectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in\nfavor of those of our competitors.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may\nbe difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset\nthe additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,\nwe expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third-parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nnot only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of international\nusers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with\ndelivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market\nperception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability\nto scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\n30\nTable o f Contents\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local logistics platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our local logistics platform and\nwhile we continue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology,\nincluding enhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our\nrouting and batching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the\nresulting gains in efficiency to our platform that we expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the\ncost of our business and subject to a number of risks, including changes to our Dasher pay model. The cost\neffectiveness of our local logistics platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological\nimprovements do not reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and\ncredits. If we are unable to maintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our local logistics platform, including\nwith respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending and Dasher behavior patterns that have an impact on our\ngrowth and expenses. We generally experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the calendar year,\nalthough our rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to make, seasonal\nfluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity can be impacted by colder or more inclement\nweather, which typically increases consumer demand, and warmer or sunny weather, which typically decreases consumer\ndemand. In addition, the number of available Dashers generally decreases during periods of inclement weather, but\nconsumer demand during these times requires us to have more Dashers available to fulfill orders. During these\ntimes, we rely on incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which\nincreases our costs. Further, severe weather in certain areas can cause businesses, including restaurants, to\nclose, and make it impossible for Dashers to make deliveries if roads are closed or difficult to drive on. In\naddition, we benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we experience\na decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation periods,\ncausing a similar decrease in Dasher pay. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a\nquarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience\nmay become more pronounced and contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to scale and\nour growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations. However, we base our spending\nand investment plans on forecasts and estimates, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if\nour revenue is less than expected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the\nexpectations of investors.\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending, may adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the\nfactors having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment,\nconsumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices,\ninterest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of discretionary items\ngenerally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected.\nEconomic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes,\nwildfires, and threats to public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, small businesses that do not have\nsubstantial resources, like some of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor\neconomic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or\npermanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with\nsufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform. This risk is particularly\npronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in\nmarkets where we have fewer merchants. In addition, because spending for purchases from many of the merchants on\nour platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that any decline in consumer spending would\nhave a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses that sell products or services\nconsidered to be necessities. If spending at the merchants on our platform declines, consumers may be less likely\nto use our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n31\nTable o f Contents\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new local markets in which we have limited or no prior\noperating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new local markets. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict consumer\npreferences and purchasing habits in these new local markets. In addition, each market has unique regulatory\ndynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the\npool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with insurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new\nDashers. In addition, each market is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our\nability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently attract and\nretain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key business\nmetrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in\nthe local markets where we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are\nunable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to\nadditional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\nWe have started expanding our presence internationally. We launched our platform in Canada in 2015 and in Australia\nin 2019, and we expect to expand our international operations. Operating outside of the United States may require\nsignificant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and\ncustoms, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations\nteams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a\nvariety of reasons, including:\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture\nacross all of our offices;\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to labor and employment, data\nprivacy, tax, and local regulatory restrictions;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may increase\nour risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery,\nexport controls, and trade and economic sanctions.\nIf we or our partners fail to develop and successfully commercialize autonomous or drone delivery technologies or\nfail to develop such technologies before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected,\nchange our cost structure materially, are inferior to those of our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than\nthose of our competitors or non-autonomous or non-drone delivery methods, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\n32\nTable o f Contents\nWe believe that autonomous and drone delivery technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact our\nindustry. We have invested and we expect to continue to invest in research and development related to autonomous\nand drone delivery technologies, either directly or in partnership with companies that develop such technologies.\nWhile we believe that autonomous and drone delivery could present substantial opportunities, the development of\nsuch technologies is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Failures of our or our partners’ autonomous or drone\ndelivery technologies could generate substantial liability, create negative publicity, or result in regulatory\nscrutiny, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, results of operations, and\nprospects. Even if our or our partners’ efforts to develop autonomous and drone delivery technologies are\nsuccessful, such efforts may not be cost-effective and there is no guarantee that such technologies can reduce our\ncurrent costs of facilitating on-demand delivery services. Further, several other companies, including Uber and\nAmazon, are also developing autonomous and drone delivery technologies, either themselves or through\ncollaborations, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the local logistics\nindustry. Certain competitors may commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies at scale before we or\nour partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone delivery to market before we do, or\ntheir technology is or is perceived to be superior to our or our partners’ technology, they may be able to leverage\nsuch technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. For example, if competitors develop autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies that successfully reduce the cost of facilitating delivery logistics services, these competitors could\noffer their services at lower prices as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a\nsignificant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, we expect that governments will develop regulations that are specifically designed to apply to autonomous\nand drone technologies. These regulations could include requirements that significantly delay or narrowly limit the\ncommercialization of autonomous and drone technologies, limit the amount of autonomous and drone delivery on our\nplatform, or impose significant liabilities on manufacturers or operators of these solutions or developers of these\ntechnologies. Moreover, these regulations may affect our or our partners’ ability to design and manufacture new\nautonomous or drone technologies. For example, commercial drone regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration limit the altitude, available airspace, and weight of a drone and also the certification of remote\npilots that can operate a drone for commercial purposes in the United States. If regulations of this nature\ncontinue to be implemented, we or our partners may not be able to commercialize autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or our partners are unable to comply with existing\nor new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous and drone solutions, we could become subject to substantial\nfines or penalties.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions,\nincluding acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments that\ncomplement our business. For exa mple, in October 2019, we acquired certain assets and liabilities from Square,\nInc. related to Caviar, a marketplace focused on facilitating deliveries from p remium restaurants. We have\npreviously acquired and continue to evaluate targets that operate in relatively nascent markets, and as a result,\nthere is no assurance that such acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into our business or generate\nsubstantial revenue.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and adversely affect our\nability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel of an acquired\ncompany;\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\ndifficulties in retaining merchants, consumers, and delivery service providers, as applicable, of an acquired\ncompany;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition\nopportunities;\n33\nTable o f Contents\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or\ntechnology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue\nrecognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired\ncompany or business;\nrisks that regulatory bodies do not approve our acquisitions or business combinations or delay such approvals;\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new services cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments, or if we fail\nto successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our\nbusiness. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our\nemployees may receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their\nmotivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and\nretain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train, and integrate such\nemployees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring\nneeds or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, and employee morale,\nproductivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\n34\nTable o f Contents\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet. We\nmay operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and may identify\nadditional material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal\ncontrols, which may result in material misstatements of our consolidated financial statements or cause us to fail\nto meet our periodic reporting obligations.\nIn recent periods, we have experienced rapid growth, and this growth has placed considerable strain on our IT and\naccounting systems, processes, and personnel. As a result, in connection with the audit of our consolidated\nfinancial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered\npublic accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. A material\nweakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that\nthere is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will\nnot be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nThe material weakness that we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified occurred because (i)\nwe had inadequate processes and controls to ensure an appropriate level of precision related to our revenue to cash\nreconciliation process, and (ii) we did not have sufficient resources with the adequate technical skills to meet\nthe emerging needs of our financial reporting requirements.\nWhile we believe this material weakness has been remediated as of December 31, 2020, we cannot assure you that we\nhave identified all of our existing material weaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material\nweaknesses. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result\nin errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements,\nand could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us\nand cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as\namended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and\nregulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of\nthese rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make\nsome activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems,\nand resources.\n35\nTable o f Contents\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for\nthe years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a\nmaterial weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. To address this material weakness, we hired\nadditional accounting, engineering, and business intelligence personnel and implemented process level and\nmanagement review controls to identify and address emerging risks. While we believe this material weakness has been\nremediated as of December 31, 2020, we cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material\nweaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial\nreporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any\ndifficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to\nfail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior\nperiods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could\nadversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting\nfirm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will\neventually be required to include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence\nin our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of\nour Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able\nto remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that\nimplement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we are\nrequired to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting commencing with our second annual report on Form 10-K.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting until the year ending December 31, 2021. At such time, our independent\nregistered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the\nlevel at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to\nmaintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect\non our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\noverwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not\nreturn to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that\nwe do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our\ntechnology and network architecture to accommodate actual and\n36\nTable o f Contents\nanticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue, and\naccess or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in\nexposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We\nmay need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around\nerrors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any\nsuch errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have expended and intend to expend substantial funds to satisfy a portion of our tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise in connection with the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs, which may have an\nadverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have also implemented “sell-to-cover” in\nwhich shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf of RSU holders upon vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have expended and intend to expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance\nobligations that arise upon the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs. Certain of our RSUs vested upon\nthe effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement (the “IPO Vested RSUs”) and will settle approximately 180 days\nfollowing the effective date of our IPO Registration Statement under their terms (the “IPO Vested RSU Settlement\nDate”). Under U.S. tax laws, the employment tax withholding and remittance obligations for the IPO Vested RSUs\narose in connection with their vesting, and the income tax withholding and remittance obligations will arise in\nconnection with their settlement on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date. On the initial vesting date for the IPO\nVested RSUs, we withheld shares and remitted tax withholding amounts on behalf of the holders of IPO Vested RSUs at\nthe applicable statutory rates for those IPO Vested RSU holders who elect to net share settle these tax withholding\nobligations, for which we expended approximately $7 million to satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations.\nCertain IPO Vested RSU holders elected to receive a short-term loan from us, with interest that will accrue at the\napplicable federal rate to settle the tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the vesting of the IPO\nVested RSUs on the effectiveness of our IPO registration statement. The short-term loan extended to employees\ntotaled $10 million as of December 31, 2020. The balance of the loan is repayable from the proceeds of sale of\nshares into the market on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date, which will result in dilution to our stockholders.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs (including the income tax withholding and remittance obligations due with respect to the IPO\nVested RSUs on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date), we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock\nthat would otherwise be issued with respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash (which may\ninclude cash generated from the proceeds of the IPO) to satisfy such tax obligations or (ii) have the holders of\nsuch RSUs use a broker or brokers to sell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement\ndate, with the proceeds of such sales to be delivered to us for us to remit to the relevant taxing authorities, in\norder to satisfy such tax withholding and remittance obligations. The tax withholding due in connection with such\nRSU vesting and settlement will be based on the then-current value of the underlying shares of our Class A common\nstock, and we would expect to withhold and remit the tax withholding liabilities at the applicable statutory rates\non behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash, which would result in significant cash\nexpenditures by us. If we implement “sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, shares with a market\nvalue equivalent to the tax withholding obligation will be sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting\nand settlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales will be remitted by us\nto the taxing authorities. Such sales will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the\ntax withholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders.\n37\nTable o f Contents\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts and key business and non-\nGAAP metrics such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, with internal systems and tools that\nare not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published\nby third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal\nsystems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over\ntime, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the\ninternal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic\nor other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe\nto be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges\nin measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics\ncould be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have\nmultiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and\nprevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our\nplatform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that\nwe measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term\nstrategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive\nour operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we\nexpect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.\nIn addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations\nof the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\nother things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public\ncompany, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract\nmanagement, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a\nresult of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition\nwill become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our\nmanagement team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous\nscrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant\nattention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our\nbusiness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations would be adversely affected.\n38\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification\nof Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an\nindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and\nregulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to changes and\ndivergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. As\nreferenced above, we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors. However, Dashers\nmay be reclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on service provider\nclassification and their potential impact on the local logistics industry. A reclassification of Dashers or other\ndelivery service providers as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations, including as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to failure to, withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act, or PAGA, and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service providers as\nemployees would require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability\nto add and retain Dashers to our platform and grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in\nDynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for\nexample, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. This action is seeking both\nrestitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as\nindependent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also sought a preliminary injunction that would have\nbarred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as independent contractors during the pendency of this\ncase. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn on December 8, 2020. We believe we have meritorious\ndefenses, despite the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In\naddition, in 2017, we settled one classification matter in California on a class basis including claims raised\nunder PAGA and are in the process of settling a similar classification matter in California. See the section titled\n“Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\nAn increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in\nDynamex to determine worker classification. Further, the California Legislature passed AB 5 and it was signed into\nlaw by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the\nDynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs.\nWe, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative, or\nProposition 22, to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. As such,\ncertain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are now applicable to us and\nDashers in California and our costs related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these\nincreased costs, we will in certain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower\norder volumes over time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these\nincreased costs could also lead to a lower Take Rate, defined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace\nGOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now applicable to us include, but are not limited to,\n(i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other amounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings\nfloor equal to (a) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged time and (b) for\n39\nTable o f Contents\nDashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for inflation after 2021) and\n(ii) for Dashers averaging at least 15 hours per week of engaged time during a calendar quarter who subscribe to a\nqualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of varying dollar amounts depending on a\nDasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 is likely to have an adverse impact on our results of\noperations. In addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation that\nwould pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing\ndiscussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that\nDashers perform. To the extent other states adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in\nsuch jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge\nhigher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Even\nwith the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be\nchallenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior Court\nchallenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22 and similar challenges may also be filed. Furthermore, if\nDashers are determined to be employees in other states or under federal law, this could result in even higher\nincreases to our costs related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and commissions even more\nand may result in further lower order volumes. To the extent Dashers are determined to be employees under other\nstate or federal law, we would be required to significantly alter our existing business model and operations, which\nwould have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses\nfor legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our\nbusiness generally, and with the food delivery services we facilitate in particular, including potential claims\nrelated to food offerings, delivery, and quality.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal,\nregulatory, and other administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage,\nworker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer\ncomplaints, intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may\nbecome subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and legal or regulatory\nproceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by Dashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we\nsometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the\nuncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we\nface increasing public scrutiny. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic\nbeverages or alcohol consumption. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of,\nany consumers, Dashers, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to potential legal\nclaims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could do so in the\nfuture as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that\ngenerate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our business. The\npotential for acts of terrorism on the U.S. or international food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs,\nit could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through our platform could be\nsubject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a food recall. In addition,\nreports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation,\nhandling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, could, as a result of\nnegative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax,\nservice fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including the background\ncheck process, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email, text, or telephone. In\naddition, we also face potential liability\n40\nTable o f Contents\nand expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers relating to, among other things, our Dasher pay\nmodel, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and\ngratuities, the local food delivery logistics services we facilitate, discrepancies between the menus on our\nwebsite and consumer mobile application and the menus at the restaurant from which the food is delivered, including\ndiscrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and taxes on such items, and the nature and frequency of\nour marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or telephone. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings”\nfor additional information about these types of legal proceedings.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our\nwebsite and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and\nnegligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security\nincident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our\nnotification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or\nregulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious\nor not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible\nthat a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and\npenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These\nproceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or\nother orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual\nand other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial\npartners and current and former directors and officers.\nIn addition, we include arbitration and class action waiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation\nprocess for all parties involved, as they can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in\nstate or federal court. However, arbitration can be costly and burdensome, and the use of arbitration and class\naction waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been\nthe subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we may\nlimit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory\nproceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit\ncertain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal law, there is a risk that some or\nall of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised\nto exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in\npart, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our\nbusiness or to local logistics businesses generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions\nabout tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n41\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the\nUnited States, Canada, and Australia, and we may face various indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise\nquestions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require\nus to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest,\nand could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us\nto collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a\njurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on\npast sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing\nour offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, even\nwhere we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately\ncalculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally, if merchants try to pass along increased additional\ntaxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline. Although we have reserved for potential payments of\npossible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial\ncondition would be harmed.\nUnder state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain\nstates. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and could be applicable to the cost of\ngoods or fees charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use,\nor other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past\nsales and additional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our\nplatform. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing\nauthorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\ncollect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related\nlegislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. , certain states have enacted\nlaws that would require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting\nor collection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. This new\nlegislation could require us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated\nwith tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less\nattractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, federal tax rules generally require payors to report payments to unrelated parties to the IRS. Under certain\ncircumstances, a failure to comply with such reporting obligations may cause us to become liable to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy\nsuch failures in a timely manner.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\ncertain non-deductible expenses, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate\nwould reduce profitability or increase losses.\nAs we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States or foreign\ntaxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and\nforeign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no\nassurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to employment taxes\nand sales taxes are described in\n42\nTable o f Contents\nmore detail under “ —If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.” and “—Taxing authorities may successfully assert\nthat we have not properly collected, or in the future should collect, sales and use, gross receipts, value added,\nor similar taxes and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations,\nor inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”\nOn December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was\nenacted, which contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a\ntransition to a new territorial system of taxation. The primary impact of the new legislation on our provision for\nincome taxes was a reduction of the future tax benefits of our deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in\nthe corporate tax rate. However, since we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets,\nthese changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The impact of the Tax Act\nwill likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, which we will continue to\nmonitor and assess.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated $689 million and $547 million of federal and state net operating loss\ncarryforwards, or NOLs, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to expire\nin 2033 for federal and 2023 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in\ntime to use NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to\nuse its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income may\nbe limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5\npercent stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply\nunder state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income and\nliabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that\nmay occur in the future.\nUnder the Tax Act, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, net\noperating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 may be\ncarried back to each of the five taxable years preceding the tax year of such loss, but net operating losses\narising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 may not be carried back. Additionally, under the Tax\nAct, as modified by the CARES Act, net operating losses from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 may\noffset no more than 80% of current taxable income annually for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, but\nthe 80% limitation on the use of net operating losses from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 does not\napply for taxable income in tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. NOLs arising in tax years ending after\nDecember 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but NOLs generated in tax years ending before January 1,\n2018 will continue to have a two-year carryback and twenty-year carryforward period. As we maintain a full\nvaluation allowance against our U.S. NOLs, these changes will not impact our balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.\nHowever, in future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, the changes in\nthe carryforward and carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our\nvaluation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2019.\nThere is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs and tax credits by\ncertain jurisdictions, including in order to raise additional revenue to help counter the fiscal impact from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, possibly with retroactive effect, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs and tax credits\ncould expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. A temporary suspension of the use\nof certain NOLs and tax credits has been enacted in California, and other states may enact suspensions as well. For\nthese reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and tax credits.\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and\nfailure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe local delivery logistics industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are\nsubject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as\nworker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other highly\nregulated products, online credit card payments, gratuities, pricing and commissions, text messaging, subscription\nservices, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data security, consumer protection, background checks,\nwebsite and mobile application accessibility, and tax are\n43\nTable o f Contents\noften complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and\ninterpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting,\nincluding varying standards and interpretations between state and federal law, between individual states, and even\nat the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time\nthrough judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,\nsuch as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have been proactively working with state and local\ngovernments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available broadly in the United States and Canada.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their\nusers and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion\nof privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on\nthe nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,\nregulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative\nand regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business. It is also\nlikely that if our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, we\nwould become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how existing\nlaws would be applied to our business and the new laws to which it may become subject.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,\ntechnology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and\nadministrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they\nmay view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to\nour business, including by changing employment-related laws or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses\nlike ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in connection with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, jurisdictions across the United States, including Washington, Massachusetts, jurisdictions\nwithin Los Angeles County, California, San Francisco, California, Chicago, Illinois, and New York, New York, have\nimplemented temporary price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative\nproposals to make price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals\nto be made. These price controls have had in the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on\nour results of operations. These price controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the\nfees we charge to consumers, though we are aware of two jurisdictions which have adopted explicit limits or\nprohibitions against doing so in connection with price controls, which could further increase our costs. With the\ncontinued duration of COVID-19, we expect these existing price controls to persist in the near term and for\nadditional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If any of these events occur, or if\nprice controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or\nconflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which creates additional challenges to managing our\nbusiness.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses that perceive our\nbusiness model negatively to raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their\ntrade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant resources to shape the\nlegal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to\nchange such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the\nability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply with these laws or\nregulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that\nwe may not be able to anticipate at this time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement\nnew measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to\ndiscontinue certain services or platform features, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply\nwith applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings,\nfines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement\nactions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative\nproposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred\nto prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n44\nTable o f Contents\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws\nand regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, and other\nanticorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad. These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government\nofficials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person, or gain any\nimproper advantage. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and\ncompliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address\ncompliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of\nour policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, and our exposure for violating\nthese laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign\njurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money\nlaundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of\nsignificant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment\nfrom U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or\noverall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws\nspecifically governing the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and\nfuture laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce,\nor other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business\npractices, or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue\nto evolve, may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content,\ncopyrights, distribution, social media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts\nand other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and\nquality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and\nother taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to\nexpand internationally, it is possible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our\nmobile applications or website or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and website. Any\nfailure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our\nreputation and brand, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other data relating to\nthe users on our platform, as well as other personally identifiable information and other data relating to\nindividuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and international laws and\nregulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types\nof data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic\nDocuments Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law,\nAustralia’s Privacy Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or the TCPA, Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, and effective as of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA. These laws,\nrules, and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation,\namendments to existing legislation, and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to\nanother. For example, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires new\ndisclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of\npersonal information. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation. Aspects of the CCPA and its\ninterpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching\n45\nTable o f Contents\nand may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related\ncosts and expenses. The CCPA has been amended on multiple occasions, and it is unclear whether it will be further\namended. For example, a ballot initiative in California in November 2020 titled the California Privacy Rights Act,\nor CPRA, was approved by California voters and significantly modified the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty\nand likely requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA creates obligations\nrelating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1,\n2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA. The\neffects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to modify our data processing\npractices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, many laws and\nregulations relating to privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain\ntypes of data are subject to varying degrees of enforcement and new and changing interpretations by courts. The\nCCPA and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security,\nparticularly any new or modified laws or regulations, or changes to the interpretation or enforcement of such laws\nor regulations, that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data\nretention, transfer, or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our platform, require significant\nchanges to our operations, or even prevent us from providing our platform in jurisdictions in which we currently\noperate and in which we may operate in the future.\nAdditionally, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with\nprivacy, data protection, and information security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry\nstandards, or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRA imposing\nnew and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application\nof these and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making\nnecessary changes to our policies and practices and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or platform\ncould be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or\nobligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or merchants on our platform, to comply with\napplicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information\nsecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally\nidentifiable information or other data relating to Dashers, consumers, or other individuals, or the perception that\nany of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and\nexisting Dashers and consumers from using our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by\ngovernmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy\nconcerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities\nor claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of\nautomated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil\nclaims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text\nmessages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we\nbecome liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\nGAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and various bodies\nformed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or\ninterpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the\nreporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued\nAccounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers (Topic 606),” or ASC 606,\nwhich superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.\n2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” or ASC 842, which increases lease transparency and comparability among\norganizations. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting\npolicies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\n46\nTable o f Contents\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance\ncoverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their\nobligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including auto liability,\nemployment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches,\ncrime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business\nliabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving\nservices, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough\ninsurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services,\nand we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain.\nAdditionally, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related\nclaims that we make. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of\ninsurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of\nthese merchant agreements.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured\nretentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles\nfor many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or\nwe may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim,\npremiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we\nexperience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance\nclaims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of claims under our\ndeductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made by consumers and payments made to\nmerchants and Dashers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third party and other payment-related\nrisks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made by consumers and payments\nmade to merchants and Dashers. Under our commercial agreement with Stripe, Stripe may terminate the relationship\nwith advanced notice. If Stripe terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on\ncommercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to\nsecure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and\nservices provided by Stripe may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be\ncompromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments\nor other payment transactions or make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our\nbusiness for an extended period of time, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, and adversely\naffect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nNearly all payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment services,\nwhich subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws\nand regulations relating to the payments we accept from our consumers, including with respect to money laundering,\nmoney transfers, privacy, and information security. If we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable\nregulations, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or\ncriminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other\npayment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely\non data provided by Stripe for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in\nsuch data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nFurther, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable law, we could become subject to\ncertain laws, rules, and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and\nnumerous state and local agencies that may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may\nhave a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we\ncould be subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial\nservices, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations governing our business that we are\nsubject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we\nare not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more\njurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators. In addition to\n47\nTable o f Contents\nfines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil\nproceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make\nchanges to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating\nrules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain\nservices to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or\nregulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment\nprocessor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these\nrules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations on a single datacenter provided by Amazon Web Services,\nor AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the\nfacilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters,\ncybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s\ncontinuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the\nfuture we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to\na variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and\ncapacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the\nrequirements of users on our platform. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to\nour success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform. It may become\nincreasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand\nand the usage of our platform increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our\nreputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform. Any of the above circumstances or events\nmay harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short-\nterm loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the\nagreement for convenience by providing us at least 30 days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the agreement\nfor cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure\nperiod, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice. Even though our\nplatform is entirely in the cloud, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud\ninfrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated\nor we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime for a\nshort period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers.\nHowever, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers\nwould cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations over the longer term.\n48\nTable o f Contents\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal and/or driving records of potential\nDashers to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our\ninternal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their\ncontractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our\nthird-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with\nus on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure\nsimilar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable timeframe. In certain jurisdictions, including the United\nStates, we rely on a single third-party background check provider for these jurisdictions. If we cannot find\nalternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard\npotential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential Dashers and we may have\ndifficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background checks conducted by our\nthird-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our expectations, unqualified\nDashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we may be unable to adequately\nprotect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified Dashers may be inadvertently\nexcluded from our platform. For example, we had a Dasher who had a criminal conviction that should have excluded\nhim from using our platform who was nonetheless cleared by one of our background check providers, and as a result,\nwe allowed him to make deliveries on our platform and he was subsequently alleged to cause personal injury to a\nmerchant on our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely\naffected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages\nin criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such\ncriminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our platform. In addition, if\nthe background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet the requirements under\napplicable laws and regulations, we could face legal liability or negative publicity.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced non-material issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related\nto notice requirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be\nlimited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail\nto conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of\neligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By\nchoosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n49\nTable o f Contents\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the\ndistribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the\nmapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all\nmapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping\nfunctions may not be reliable. From time to time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of\nour third party software providers. If, in connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its\nrelationship with us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our\nplatform could be disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software\nthat we and Dashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software\non terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such\nsoftware, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or\ninferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not\ncontrol.\nWe have integrations with Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio, Wavefront, Snowflake, Olo, third-party offerings such as\nGoogle Maps and AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party applications, products, and services are\nconstantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with\nthird-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our\nplatform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or\nexert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nAs our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we face to increase. Should any of our\ncompetitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that\ndegrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our platform, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such\napplication marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that reduce\nthe effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial\nresults, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. Any\nchanges in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our applications or give\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ applications could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile\ndevices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our\napplications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our\napplications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify\ntheir search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such\nmobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our applications, our\nuser growth could slow. Our applications have experienced fluctuations in the past, and we anticipate similar\nfluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will\ncontinue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our applications. Additionally, in order to\ndeliver high-quality applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range\nof mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining\nrelationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’ experience. If merchants, consumers,\nor Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile\ndevices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our user growth\nand user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers and Dashers. For example, Apple announced its plans to make\ncertain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating\nsystem. We expect that these\n50\nTable o f Contents\nchanges will negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions because they will limit our\nvisibility into the performance of specific advertising channels. If we are unable to mitigate the effects of these\ndevelopments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates from existing\nconsumers on our platform, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new consumer growth could decline and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected if we fail to appear prominently in\nsearch results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search\nengines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is\ndue in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search\nengine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may\nnot be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Our website has experienced\nfluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any\nreduction in the number of consumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information from third-\nparty sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources\nor the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and\ninformation may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including general expectations\nconcerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size,\nare based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of\nassumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or\nthe methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or\nmethodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, our reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions. Competitors have and may continue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our\nability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade\nname or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad\n51\nTable o f Contents\nmay be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope\nof the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or register our\ntrademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our\nproprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFor example, in 2020 we received a letter from International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, alleging that\nwe infringe on at least five U.S. patents held by IBM, and inviting us to negotiate a business resolution of the\nallegations. To date, no litigation has been filed by IBM against us regarding the IBM patents. Based upon our\npreliminary review of these patents, we believe we have meritorious defenses to IBM’s allegations, although there\ncan be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business\nresolution that is satisfactory to us.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com.\nIf we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable\nregistration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could\ncause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in\nquestion. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of\nreasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using\ndomain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that\ninfringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nProtecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at\n52\nTable o f Contents\nlittle or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software\nwith open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release\nthe source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software license. This could enable\nour competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a\nloss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the release of the affected portions of our source\ncode, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and resources to re-engineer\nsome or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software until we can adequately\naddress the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that\nincorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to\nfully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or\nother liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on\nterms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our\nplatform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source\ncode form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire\ncomplementary businesses and technologies. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash, cash\nequivalents, and marketable securities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital\nand capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months, we may require additional financing. Accordingly, we\nmay need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through\nfuture issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders\ncould suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges\nsuperior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time,\nand our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans,\nand operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be\nable to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfinancing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our\nbusiness growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility includes a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be\n53\nTable o f Contents\naccelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell\nsufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of\noperations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially\nreasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding\nunder the revolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of\nincorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our\nassets, or other major corporate transaction.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2020, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering,\nand a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of\nour board of directors collectively held 69% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate,\nwhich voting power may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards\n(including in connection with the Equity Award Exchange). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders\n(including the CEO Performance Award) had been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock\nas of December 31, 2020, our Co-Founders would collectively hold 79% of the voting power of our outstanding capital\nstock. Our Co-Founders have also entered into the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and\nirrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang,\nand their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted\nupon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring\nthe approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to\nour certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or\nsubstantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from\nyours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated\ncontrol may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive\nour stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company,\nand might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting\npower and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders,\nwhich may result in our Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself\nor the Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our IPO, which we sometimes refer to\nherein as the 35% Ownership Threshold; (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr. Xu,\nduring which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person\ndesignated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors(or if there is no such person, then our secretary then\nin office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days\nfollowing the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation): or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180\ndays following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or\nconsultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary\nresignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to\nbe renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of all\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation occurs as the Final Conversion Date.\n54\nTable o f Contents\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of\nour total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the\noutcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock have no\nvoting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution,\nwhich would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to\nMr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class\nC common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met.\nAs a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our\nvoting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted\nto a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our Co-Founders and,\nin that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their\nholdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will\nnot be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock\nExchange.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail\nourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders, our Co-\nFounders collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2020,\nand Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common\nstock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his\ndiscretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as\nthat term is set forth in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a\ncompany in which over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or\nanother company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New\nYork Stock Exchange regarding corporate governance, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\nthe requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance\nevaluation of the committee; and\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,\nand the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal\ncounsel, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled\ncompany” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these\nexemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the\nNew York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the\nprotections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture issuances of our Class C common stock, if any, will not dilute the voting control of Mr. Xu, but will dilute\nhis economic interest which could cause his interests to conflict with your interests. Further, the issuance of\nshares of Class C common stock, whether to Mr. Xu or to other stockholders, could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s\nvoting control.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the\n55\nTable o f Contents\ncompany’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer\nadmit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices include the Russell\n2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Also in\n2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment of no-vote and multi-\nclass structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices and in October 2018,\nMSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in its indices and to\nlaunch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under such announced\npolicies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and,\nas a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices\nwould not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if\nany, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible\nthat they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of\ninvestment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices\nwould likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to\nother investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\n56\nTable o f Contents\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nA substantial portion of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are restricted\nfrom immediate resale, but may be sold on a stock exchange in the near future. The large number of shares eligible\nfor public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price\nof our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market in the near future, and the perception that these sales could occur may also\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOur executive officers, directors, and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock and securities\nconvertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock have entered into market standoff agreements with us or have\nentered into lock-up agreements with the underwriters of our IPO under which they have agreed, subject to specific\nexceptions, not to sell any of our stock for a period of time up to 180 days following the date of our final\nprospectus relating to our IPO, dated December 8, 2020 and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act,\nor our Prospectus. We refer to such period as the lock-up period.\nOur lock-up period has two potential release dates, the first following our first earnings release or periodic\nreport (either our quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K), which was determined to be March\n9, 2021, as described below, and the second following our second earnings release or periodic report, or 180 days,\nwhichever is earlier.\nOn March 1, 2021 the underwriters of our IPO agreed that the restricted period under the lock-up agreement will end\nwith respect to 40% of the shares subject to each lock-up agreement (or 20% of the shares if the stockholder is a\nmember of the Company’s board of directors (excluding affiliated funds) or management team) and become eligible for\nsale in the public market at the open of trading on March 9, 2021 (the \"Early Lock-Up Expiration Date\").\nAll remaining shares of common stock subject to the lock-up agreement and not released on the Early Lock-Up\nExpiration Date will be released upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the opening of trading on the third\nfull trading day after we have publicly furnished our second earnings release on Form 8-K or filed our second\nperiodic report with the SEC or (ii) 180 days after the Effective Date, or the Final Lock-Up Expiration Date. We\nwill announce the Final Lock-Up Expiration Date through a press release or Form 8-K at least two full trading days\nbefore it is effective. We and the underwriters may release certain stockholders from the market standoff\nagreements or lock-up agreements prior to the end of the lock-up period.\nSales of our Class A common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult\nfor us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could\nalso cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares\nof our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n57\nTable o f Contents\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, or the Voting\nThreshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first\nrecommended or approved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, our President, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Nothing in our\namended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such\nclaims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and\n58\nTable o f Contents\nrestated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.",

          "content": "Item 3. Legal Proceedings\nWe, including Caviar and our other subsidiaries, are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in,\nlegal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal\nProceedings”) in the ordinary course of business, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, Caviar delivery\nproviders, or other third parties (individually or as class actions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For\nsome matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses\nis not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a\nmaterial loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nIndependent Contractor Classification Matters\nWe are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government\ninvestigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging\nthe classification of third-party delivery providers on our platform and on the Caviar platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\n59\nTable o f Contents\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought\nunder PAGA, and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the\nclassification of third-party delivery providers on our platform and on the Caviar platform as independent\ncontractors.\nIn December 2019, we filed an agreement to pay $40 million with the representatives of Dashers that had filed\ncertain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging\nworker misclassification of Dashers, or the Marciano settlement. These actions were filed by and on behalf of\nMassachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since August 2016. The settlement was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco on November 21, 2019. On April 24, 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues\nwith the filed settlement agreement and requesting supplemental briefing from the parties. On June 8, 2020, the\nparties submitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement agreement to the court. The amended settlement\nagreement increased the total amount to be paid by us from $40 million to $41 million. On June 19, 2020, the court\nissued a tentative ruling raising certain issues with the filed amended settlement agreement and requesting\nsupplemental briefing from the parties. On July 24, 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and an\namended settlement agreement to the court. On August 31, 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling denying\nplaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of the amended settlement without prejudice and inviting the parties to\nfile supplemental briefing addressing the concerns raised by the court. On October 30, 2020, we entered into an\namended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by the company from $41 million to $89\nmillion. On November 4, 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and the amended settlement agreement to\nthe court. On February 17, 2021, the court issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff’s motion for preliminary\napproval of the amended settlement without prejudice. A hearing on the motion is set for March 22, 2021. If the\namended settlement ultimately receives final approval from the court, we expect that this would resolve claims\nunder PAGA and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in California for the period of August 30, 2016\nthrough December 31, 2020 and claims alleging worker misclassification for Dashers in Massachusetts for the period\nof September 26, 2014 through December 31, 2020. Although the settlement only involves claimants in certain\nactions, any final settlement would be on a class basis and would encompass claims by all Dashers in California and\nMassachusetts for the period noted in the previous sentence. Dashers that are members of the class purported to be\ncovered by the settlement could elect to opt out of such settlement, and therefore could bring claims against us\nseparately.\nMore than 35,000 Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have\nfiled or expressed an intention to file arbitration demands against us that assert worker misclassification claims.\nAs of August 17, 2020, we have reached agreements that would resolve the worker misclassification claims of a large\nmajority of these individuals. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers are eligible\nfor settlement payments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual\nsettlement agreements. We anticipate that the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers\nunder these individual settlement agreements, including attorneys’ fees, will be approximately $85 million. We do\nnot admit any allegations of wrongdoing as part of the resolution of these matters.\nVarious other Dashers and Caviar delivery providers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge\nin the future, their classification on the DoorDash platform and on the Caviar platform, respectively, as an\nindependent contractor under federal and state law, seeking monetary, injunctive, or other relief. We are currently\ninvolved in an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney and in a number of such actions filed by\nindividual Dashers and Caviar delivery providers, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought\nin, or compelled pursuant to our Independent Contractor Agreement to, individual arbitration. This action brought\nby the San Francisco District Attorney is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would\nbar us from continuing to classify Dashers as independent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also\nsought a preliminary injunction that would have barred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as\nindependent contractors during the pendency of this case. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn\non December 8, 2020.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States, Canada, and Australia. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law on September\n18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies,\nsupported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative titled Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve\nflexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. In addition, several other states where we operate may be\nconsidering adopting legislation similar to Proposition 22, which we would expect to increase our costs related to\nDashers in such jurisdictions, could result in lower order volumes if we charge higher fees and commissions as a\nresult of such laws, and could also adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of\nProposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation have\n60\nTable o f Contents\nbeen and may in the future be challenged and subject to litigation. Additionally, an increasing number of\njurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to AB 5 to determine worker classification.\nWe believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of\ndefense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and other\nfactors.\nConsumer Protection and Other Actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, and other laws. In addition, we have been\nsubject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and our Dasher pay model. We\ndispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual Property Matters\nFrom time to time, we are involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other\nintellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive correspondence from other purported\nholders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or asserting infringement\nof such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these\nmatters.\nRegulatory and Administrative Investigations, Audits, and Inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our\nbusiness practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers and Caviar delivery providers, our Dasher pay\nmodel, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and other\nmatters. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related governmental action are inherently\nunpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry having a material\nimpact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an\ninvestigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action.\nRegardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with\ncooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal Injury Matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on the DoorDash platform or Caviar delivery providers who have been active on the Caviar platform. We\nare currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers\nthat utilize the DoorDash platform, Caviar delivery providers on the Caviar platform, and third parties. In many of\nthese matters, we believe we have meritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or\nincidents that individually, in our opinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and\nlegal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an\nadverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of\nmanagement resources, and other factors.",

The actual number of\nstockholders is greater than this number of record holders and includes stockholders who are beneficial owners but\nwhose shares are held in street name by brokers and other nominees.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were 14 holders of record of our Class B common stock. All shares of our Class B\ncommon stock are beneficially owned by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, or Stanley Tang.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there were no holders of our Class C common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available\nfunds and future earnings and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe may enter into credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that will restrict our ability to\ndeclare or pay cash dividends or make distributions on our capital stock. Any future determination regarding the\ndeclaration and payment of dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-\nexisting conditions, including our financial condition, operating results, contractual restrictions, capital\nrequirements, business prospects, and other factors our board of directors may deem relevant.\nPerformance Graph\nThis performance graph shall not be deemed “soliciting material” or to be “filed” with the SEC for purposes of\nSection 18 of the Exchange Act, or otherwise subject to the liabilities under that Section, and shall not be deemed\nto be incorporated by reference into any filing of DoorDash Inc. under the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act.\nThe following graph compares the cumulative total return to stockholders on our Class A common stock with the\ncumulative total returns of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, or the S&P 500, and the S&P 500 Information Technology\nSector Index. An investment of $100 is assumed to have been made in our Class A common stock and in each index on\nDecember 9, 2020, the date our Class A common stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and its relative\nperformance is tracked through December 31, 2020. The graph uses the closing market price on December 9, 2020 of\n$189.51 per share as the initial value of our Class A common stock.\nThe returns shown are based on historical results and are not intended to suggest future performance.\n62\nTable o f Contents\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities and Use of Proceeds\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nPreferred Stock Issuances\nIn June 2020, we sold an aggregate of 8,321,395 shares of our Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock to\nten accredited investors at a purchase price of $45.9062 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of\n$382,003,624.\nOption and RSU Issuances\nFrom January 1, 2020 through December 9, 2020 (the date of the filing of our registration statement on Form S-8),\nwe granted to our directors, officers, employees, consultants and other service providers an aggregate of\n18,833,595 restricted stock units to be settled in shares of our Class A common stock under our 2014 Stock Plan. No\noptions was granted under our 2014 Stock Plan in the same period of time.\nWarrants\nIn November 2020, a warrant to purchase 105,330 shares of our Class A common stock was exercised at an exercise\nprice of $1.492 per share, for an aggregate exercise price of $157,153.\nConvertible Note Issuances\nIn February 2020, we issued convertible notes in the aggregate principal amount of $340 million to four accredited\ninvestors. In February 2021, we paid to the convertible note holders an aggregate of $375 million in cash as\nrepayment and settlement of all principal and interest due under the convertible notes, and the convertible notes\nare no longer outstanding.\nNone of the foregoing transactions involved any underwriters, underwriting discounts or commissions, or any public\noffering. We believe the offers, sales, and issuances of the above securities were exempt from registration under\nthe Securities Act (or Regulation D or Regulation S promulgated thereunder) by virtue of Section 4(a)(2) of the\nSecurities Act because the issuance of securities to the recipients did not involve a public offering, or in\nreliance on Rule 701 because the transactions were pursuant to compensatory benefit plans or contracts relating to\ncompensation as provided under such rule. The recipients of the securities in each of these transactions\nrepresented their intentions to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale in\nconnection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were placed upon the stock certificates issued in\nthese transactions. All recipients had adequate access, through their relationships with us, to information about\nus. The sales of these securities were made without any general solicitation or advertising.\n63\nTable o f Contents\nUse of Proceeds\nOn December 11, 2020, we closed our IPO, in which we sold 33 million shares of our Class A common stock at a price\nof $102.00 per share. All of the shares issued and sold in the IPO were registered under the Securities Act\npursuant to a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333-250056), which was declared effective by the SEC on\nDecember 8, 2020. We raised aggregate net proceeds of $3.3 billion, after deducting underwriting discounts and\ncommissions of $81 million and offering costs of approximately $19 million subject to certain cost reimbursements.\nWe intend to use the net proceeds we received from our IPO for general corporate purposes, including working\ncapital, operating expenses, repaying the 2020 convertible notes, and capital expenditures. Additionally, we may\nuse a portion of the net proceeds we received from our IPO to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services,\nor technologies. However, we do not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions or investments at\nthis time. In November 2020 we announced a $200 million pledge, as part of our Main Street Strong program, to\nsupport merchants, Dashers, and local communities. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds we received from\nour IPO to satisfy a portion of our anticipated tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the vesting\nand settlement of RSUs that we have granted. A majority of the RSUs that we have granted to date generally vest\nupon the satisfaction of both service-based and liquidity event-related performance vesting conditions occurring\nbefore the award’s expiration date. The service-based vesting condition is generally satisfied by the award holder\nproviding services to us over a four-year period. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was\nsatisfied on the Effective Date.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual\nReport on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.\nFactors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those identified below and those discussed in\nthe section titled “Risk Factors” and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our historical results are\nnot necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any period in the future.\nOverview\nWe have built a technology-enabled local logistics platform that enables local brick-and-mortar businesses to\naddress consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy. Our local\nlogistics platform connects over 450,000 merchants, over 20 million consumers, and over 1 million Dashers in the\nUnited States, Canada, and Australia every month.\nWe built our products to serve the needs of these three key constituencies. We do this primarily through our\nMarketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such\nas customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support.\nOur Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach. It generates significant\ndemand for merchants by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand through\ndelivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our business today, we offer merchants a\nvariety of products, which we refer to as merchant services, to facilitate sales that merchants have originated\nthrough their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants that have generated\nconsumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our local logistics platform. Storefront\nenables merchants to create their own\n64\nTable o f Contents\nbranded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to\ne-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, we completed our IPO in which we issued and sold 33,000,000 shares of Class A common stock at\nthe public offering price of $102.00 per share. We received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our shares\nin the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. For additional\ninformation, see Note 1 - Organization and Description of Business included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial\nStatements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nKey Business and Non-GAAP Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our consolidated financial statements, we use the following key business\nand non-GAAP metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate business\nplans, and make strategic decisions:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018           2019            2020\n-in millions, except percentages\nTotal Orders                                                              83            263             816\nMarketplace GOV                          $                             2,812       $  8,039       $  24,664\nContribution Profit (Loss)(1)            $                               -59       $   -200       $     663\nContribution Margin(1)                                                   -20  %         -23  %           23  %\nContribution Profit (Loss) as a % of                                      -2  %          -2  %            3  %\nMarketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                       $                              -158       $   -475       $     189\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)                                                -54  %         -54  %            7  %\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                                     -6  %          -6  %            1  %\nGOV\n(1) Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP\nfinancial measures. For more information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations to the most\ndirectly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP\nFinancial Measures\".\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed on the DoorDash platform, including those completed\nthrough our Marketplace and our Drive offering, over the period of measurement. Total Orders have increased over\ntime as we have added new consumers, increased retention and engagement of existing consumers, including through\nthe launch of DashPass, expanded into new markets, and increased the number of orders completed through Drive.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, Total Orders increased to 816 million, or 210% growth compared to the year\nended December 31, 2019. The increase in Total Orders was driven by increased retention and engagement of existing\nconsumers, the addition of new consumers, and an increase in the number of orders completed through Drive. These\ntrends accelerated in part due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in in-store dining shutdowns\nand the adoption of shelter-in-place measures. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our business\nstemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a widespread rollout of the\nCOVID-19 vaccine, and we expect the growth rate of Total Orders to decline in future periods.\nAs we continue to increase consumer adoption and make using DoorDash a regular activity, we expect Total Orders to\ncontinue to grow.\n65\nTable o f Contents\nMarketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of Marketplace orders completed on our local\nlogistics platform, including taxes, tips, 5 and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to\nDashPass. Marketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does\nnot include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through\nDrive because we utilize a per-order fee structure for such orders and typically do not receive information\nregarding the dollar value of such orders. Marketplace GOV is primarily driven by the volume and dollar value of\norders completed on our local logistics platform.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, Marketplace GOV increased to $24.7 billion, or 207% growth compared to the\nyear ended December 31, 2019, based on the growth in Total Orders as well as the increasing size of Marketplace\norders in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our\nbusiness stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a widespread\nrollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect the growth rate in Marketplace GOV to decline in future periods.\nWe expect that Marketplace GOV will continue to grow as Total Orders grow, though at a slower rate, as Marketplace\nGOV does not include Drive while Total Orders do include Drive. We further expect that Marketplace GOV will grow at\na slower rate than Total Orders as we continue to broaden our selection of merchants at lower price points to\nincrease affordability for consumers. We are purposefully increasing the affordability of the selection of goods\noffered by merchants on our platform to improve consumer engagement over time.\n5 Dashers receive 100% of tips.\n66\nTable o f Contents\nContribution Profit (Loss). 6 We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and\nmarketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,\nand (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Gross profit (loss) is\ndefined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and\namortization related to cost of revenue. We define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a\npercentage of revenue for the same period.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, Contribution Profit improved to $663 million, compared to a Contribution Loss\nof $200 million in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by the growth in Marketplace GOV, increased merchant\ncommissions and fees from our Marketplace as well as Drive, cost structure improvements, and increased operating\nleverage as a result of scale in our business. In the year ended December 31, 2020, Contribution Margin increased\nto 23%, compared to negative 23% in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by cost structure improvements and\nincreased operating leverage as a result of scale in our business.\nOur Contribution Profit (Loss) can vary significantly as we invest in enhancing the scale of our local logistics\nplatform, including through investments in sales and marketing and promotions spend and launching new products and\ngeographies. We expect Contribution Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin to fluctuate in the near term as we\ncontinue to invest in the growth of our business, and improve over the long term as we achieve greater scale,\nincrease adoption, and drive efficiency through operational improvements.\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It\ndoes not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain\nexpenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss)\nis not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is\nnot a financial measure of profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for the profitability of\nour business nor does it imply profitability.\n6 For more information about Contribution Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin, including the limitations of such\nmeasures, and a reconciliation of Contribution Profit (Loss) to gross profit (loss), the most directly comparable\nfinancial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”\n67\nTable o f Contents\nAdjusted EBITDA. 7 We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and\nregulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) a one-time non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract\nrelated to the issuance of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, (iii) loss on disposal of property\nand equipment, (iv) acquisition-related costs, (v) impairment expenses, (vi) provision for income taxes, (vii)\ninterest income and expense, (viii) foreign exchange gain (loss), (ix) stock-based compensation expense and certain\npayroll tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that\nwe use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is\ncalculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA improved to $189 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of\nnegative $475 million in the year ended December 31, 2019. In the year ended December 31, 2020, Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin increased to 7%, compared to negative 54% in the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by cost structure\nimprovements and increased operating leverage as a result of scale in our business.\nWe expect Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin to fluctuate in the near term as we continue to invest in our\nbusiness and improve over the long term as we achieve greater scale in our business and efficiencies in our\noperating expenses.\n7 For more information about Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, including the limitations of such measures\nand more detail on the specific adjustments, and a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net loss, the most directly\ncomparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, as well as a calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nMargin, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\n68\nTable o f Contents\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our local\nlogistics platform to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our local logistics\nplatform to arrange for delivery services. We recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an\nagent for both partner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects commissions charged to partner\nmerchants and fees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which\nincludes certain discounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer.\nRevenue from our Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s\nproducts.\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of our\nMarketplace revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the\ncontractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of subscription purchased by the\nconsumer.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Drive offering. We generate revenue from\nDrive by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery\nservices that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in\ntime when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\n69\nTable o f Contents\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of\nrebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, costs related to placing orders\nwith non-partner merchants, and insurance expenses, (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding\nmerchants and Dashers, costs for providing support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform\ninfrastructure costs, and (iii) personnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nour local operations, support, and other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses\nprimarily include salary, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined\nbased on an allocation of shared costs, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information\ntechnology costs, among all departments based on employee headcount.\nWe expect that the cost of revenue will increase on an absolute dollar basis as our business grows and as we\ncontinue to invest in order management and our platform and hire additional employees for our local operations,\nsupport, and other teams to support the growth in our business. As a result, we expect that cost of revenue as a\npercentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long term as we\nachieve greater scale and operational efficiency.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the\nreferrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing\nexpenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense\nincluding amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.\nWe expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we invest to grow our\nnetwork of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and enhance our brand awareness. We expect sales and marketing\nexpenses as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long\nterm.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data\nanalytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to our platform, as well as expenses\nassociated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\nWe plan to continue to hire employees to support our research and development efforts to expand the capabilities\nand scope of our platform and offerings. As a result, we expect that research and development expenses will\nincrease on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to invest to support these activities. We expect that research\nand development expenses as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and\ndecrease over the long term.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include\nlitigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nadministrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated\nwith fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, acquisition-related expenses, and allocated\noverhead.\nWe expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis due to increases in\nchargebacks associated with fraudulent credit card transactions and legal, tax, and regulatory expenses as we add\npersonnel and enhance our systems, processes, and controls to support the growth in our business as well as our\nincreased compliance and reporting requirements as a public company. We expect general and administrative expenses\nas a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long term.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with\nour property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with equipment for\nmerchants, including equipment for merchants under finance leases, computer equipment and software, office\nequipment, and leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized software and\nwebsite development costs, as well as acquired intangible assets.\n70\nTable o f Contents\nWe expect that depreciation and amortization expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we invest in\nproperty and equipment to support the growth in our business. We expect depreciation and amortization expenses as a\npercentage of revenue over the short term will vary from period to period and decrease over the long term.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs related to our revolving credit facility and payment-in-kind interest\non our Convertible Notes issued in February 2020.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net primarily consists of a non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract liability\nin connection with the issuance of shares of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. To accommodate\nthe timing of regulatory approvals required by an existing investor, we committed to sell $100 million of shares of\nour Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock to this investor in a subsequent closing, which ultimately\noccurred after we had entered into a non-binding term sheet to sell shares of Series G redeemable convertible\npreferred stock at a higher price per share than our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock. We determined\nthat the commitment to defer the sale of shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock to this investor\nwas a forward contract that should be classified as a liability and measured at fair value on a recurring basis,\nwith changes in fair value recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. This\nforward contract was entered into in February 2019 and settled in May 2019. Other (expense) income, net also\nincludes gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes primarily consists of U.S. federal and state income tax and franchise tax, as well as\ninternational taxes from foreign operations.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical consolidated statements of operations data:\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018        2019        2020\n-in millions\nRevenue                             $                      291    $    885

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide useful information to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall\nunderstanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to\nmetrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of\nmanagement, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors\nto use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our\nindustry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated\nstatements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted\nresearch and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss),\nContribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nshould be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to\nreview our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single\nfinancial measure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research\nand development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution\nMargin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction\nwith their respective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\n78\nTable o f Contents\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and allocated overhead.

These excluded\ncosts and expenses consist of (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses related to\nthe following: (a) worker classification matters, which were $13 million, $73 million, and $92 million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively (b) our historical Dasher pay model prior to the change\nto such pay model in 2019, which were zero for each of the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively,\nand $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, and (c) our September 2019 data breach incident, which were\nzero, $1 million, and zero for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, (ii) reserves for\nthe collection of sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, which were $6\nmillion, $11 million, and zero for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, (iii) expenses\nrelated to supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification and price controls,\nwhich were zero, $1 million, and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively,\nand (iv) donations as part of our COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts, which were zero for each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2018 and 2019, respectively, and $7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. We believe it is\nappropriate to exclude legal matter costs related to worker classification matters, our historical Dasher pay model\nand our September 2019 data breach incident from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense\nbecause (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting\nor forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such\nexpenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative\nand regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22.\nContribution Profit (Loss)\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders. We define Contribution Profit (Loss)\nas our gross profit (loss) less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related\nto cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of\nrevenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and\nmarketing expenses.

Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, provides for a $300 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility maturing on August 7, 2025, increasing to $400 million in aggregate revolving commitments upon the\nconsummation of an IPO of our common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021. Loans under the credit facility bear\ninterest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the\nfederal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a\none-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. We are also\nobligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees,\nan upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants\nunder the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2020, no amounts were drawn and we had $44\nmillion of issued letters of credit outstanding from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nConvertible Notes\nOn February 19, 2020, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to the\nConvertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated February 19, 2020, among us, Caviar, and the investors party thereto, or\nthe Note Investors. We received net proceeds of $333 million, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs and an\noriginal issue discount of $5 million. The interest rate under the Convertible Notes was 10.00% per annum, payable\nquarterly in arrears. In February 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible\nNotes in full for $375 million.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of our Class A\nshares in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $4.9 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $4.3 billion, and marketable securities of $514\nmillion. Additionally, funds held at payment processors of $146 million represent cash due from our payment\nprocessors for cleared transactions with merchants and consumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors\nfor Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money\nmarket funds. Marketable securities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, and U.S. Treasury securities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.6\nbillion as of December 31, 2020. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may\nincur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may\nrequire additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nalong with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be\nsufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n83\nTable o f Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018        2019        2020\n-in millions\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating    $                     -159    $   -467    $    252\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                             -357        -570        -192\nNet cash provided by financing                                     666       1,109       3,996\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                —           —           2\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents,     $                      150    $     72    $  4,058\nand restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $159 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. This consisted of a net\nloss of $204 million offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $24 million and non-cash depreciation\nand amortization expense of $9 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an\nincrease of $30 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, an increase of $19 million in funds held at\npayment processors, an increase of $17 million in accounts receivable, net, and an increase of $5 million in other\nassets due to timing of payments, offset by an increase of $48 million in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities, an increase of $25 million in accounts payable, and an increase of $10 million in other liabilities.\nCash used in operating activities was $467 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This consisted of a net\nloss of $667 million offset by a non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract liability of $67 million, non-\ncash depreciation and amortization expense of $32 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use\nassets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $22 million, non-cash stock-based compensation expense of\n$18 million, and non-cash bad debt expense of $4 million. The net changes in operating assets and liabilities was\nprimarily the result of an increase of $88 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, an increase of $40\nmillion in accounts receivable, net, an increase of $18 million in other assets, an increase of $9 million in funds\nheld at payment processors, a decrease of $23 million in other liabilities due to timing of legal settlements, a\ndecrease of $13 million in accounts payable, and a decrease of $3 million for payments for operating lease\nliabilities, offset by an increase of $251 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities primarily\nrelated to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and indirect taxes, accrued operations related\nexpenses, and Dasher and merchant payable. The increase in cash used in operating activities for the year ended\nDecember 31, 2019 compared to the prior year was mainly due to the increase in net loss for the year.\nCash provided by operating activities was $252 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. This consisted of a\nnet loss of $461 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $322 million, non-cash\ndepreciation and amortization expense of $120 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets\nand accretion of operating lease liabilities of $40 million, non-cash interest expense of $31 million related to\nthe convertible notes, non-cash bad debt expense of $16 million, and other non-cash expenses of $18 million. The\nnet changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of an increase of $587 million in accrued expenses\nand other current liabilities, primarily related to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and\nindirect taxes, accrued operations related expenses, Dasher and merchant payable, and contract liabilities, an\nincrease of $54 million in accounts payable, and an increase of $11 million in other liabilities, offset by an\nincrease of $248 million in accounts receivable, net, an increase of $96 million in funds held at payment\nprocessors, an increase of $96 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets, a decrease of $26 million for\npayments for operating lease liabilities, and an increase of $20 million in other assets. The increase in cash\nprovided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019\nwas mainly due to the decrease in net loss and increases in non-cash expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $357 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which consisted of\npurchases of marketable securities of $390 million, purchases of property and equipment of $13 million, and cash\noutflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $3 million, offset by proceeds from the\nmaturities of marketable securities of $49 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $570 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily consisted\nof purchases of marketable securities of $762 million, cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $315\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $78 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website\ndevelopment costs of $14 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $600\nmillion.\n84\nTable o f Contents\nCash used in investing activities was $192 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, which primarily consisted\nof purchases of marketable securities of $593 million, purchases of property and equipment of $106 million, cash\noutflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $53 million, and cash paid for acquisitions, net\nof cash acquired, of $28 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $587\nmillion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $666 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which consisted of\n$725 million of net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and $5 million of proceeds\nfrom the exercise of stock options, offset by $60 million of cash outflows due to repurchases of common stock and\n$4 million of cash outflow from other financing activities.\nCash provided by financing activities was $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2019, which primarily\nconsisted of $1.1 billion of net proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock and $3\nmillion of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by $3 million of cash outflows for payment\nof deferred offering costs.\nCash provided by financing activities was $4.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, which consisted of\n$3.3 billion of proceeds from issuance of common stock upon our IPO, net of underwriter discounts, $382 million of\nnet proceeds from the issuance of redeemable convertible preferred stock, $333 million of net proceeds from the\nissuance of convertible promissory notes, and $5 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, offset by\n$7 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $6 million of\npayment of deferred offering costs.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020:\nPayments Due by Period\nTotal       Less than         1-3         3-5       More than\n(in millions)          1 Year       Years       Years         5 Years\nOperating lease               $                     533    $         36    $     92    $     86    $        319\ncommitments(1)\nNon-cancelable purchase                             416             119         216          81               —\ncommitments(2)\nTotal contractual\nobligations and               $                     949    $        155    $    308    $    167    $        319\ncommitments\n(1) The contractual commitment amounts under operating leases in the table above are primarily related to corporate\noffice facility leases. The table above does not reflect obligations under contracts that we can cancel without a\nsignificant penalty, our option to exercise early termination rights, or the payment of related early termination\nfees.\n(2) As of December 31, 2020, our non-cancelable purchase commitments primarily pertained to the purchase of\nonboarding, technology platform infrastructure services and advertising services. The purchase commitments end on\nvarious dates that extend into 2025. These purchase commitments were not recorded as liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020, as we had not yet received the related services.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing\narrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities\nsometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of\nfacilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance\nwith GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of\nassets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported\namounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented.. We base our estimates on historical experience and on\nvarious other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ\nsignificantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual\nresults, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\ncould be affected.\n85\nTable o f Contents\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity.\nAccordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated\nfinancial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial\nstatements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606. We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders\ncompleted through our Marketplace and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to\nconsumers. We charge partner merchants commissions at an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of\ngoods ordered in exchange for the use of our local logistics platform and we charge fees to consumers for use of\nour platform to arrange for delivery services. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for\nDashPass, which is recognized as part of the DoorDash Marketplace. Revenue generated from DashPass subscriptions is\nrecognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on\nthe type of subscription purchased by the consumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from our Drive offering\nby collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery services\nthat fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time\nwhen the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nOur local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform\narranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service\nand the delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore further judgment is\nrequired to determine whether we are a principal or agent in transactions with partner merchants, consumers, and\nDashers.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we\ncontrol each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplace. The consumer accesses our local\nlogistics platform to identify merchants and place an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up\nfrom partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being\ntransferred to the consumer as we neither have the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor do we\nobtain economic benefits from the products.\nWith respect to delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as an agent for the consumer\nin facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our role with the delivery\nfacilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to prospective Dashers, we do not\ncontrol how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nAs we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and delivery services, we report revenue on a net basis,\nreflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We\nsatisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s\nproducts and we meet our performance obligations to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the\nmerchant for delivery to the consumer.\nGift Cards\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through our Marketplace. Proceeds from the sale of gift cards\nare deferred and recorded as contract liabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on our platform.\nWhen gift cards are redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected\nfrom consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\nRefunds and Credits\n86\nTable o f Contents\nFrom time to time, we issue credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may arise with\norders. We account for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore record the amount of each refund or\ncredit issued as a reduction to revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nWe offer incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use our local logistics platform. Consumers typically\nreceive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the incentives\nare described below:\nConsumer Promotions\nWe use promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to our platform. Promotions\noffered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: We record discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and reduce\nrevenue on the date we record the corresponding revenue transaction.\nConsumer referrals: We offer referral credits to our existing consumers for referrals of new consumers. These\nreferral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these credits\nthat is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess of the fair\nvalue of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, we offer promotional discounts to existing consumers. We record\nincentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduce revenue on the date we record the corresponding\nrevenue transaction.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These\nare offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay: We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak\ndemand time.\nDasher referrals: We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new\nDasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers\nas incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of\nour platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in\nexcess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nPayments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time we record\nthe corresponding revenue transaction.\nLeases\nWe apply the guidance in ASC 842 and determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. We adopted\nASC 842 on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method and used the effective date as the\ndate of initial application. We have elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components\nfor all of our leases.\nA contract is or contains a lease if it conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of\ntime in exchange for consideration. Our classes of assets that are leased include real estate leases and equipment\nleases. Operating leases consist of real estate leases and are included in operating lease right-of-use assets and\noperating lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases consist of equipment leases and are\nincluded in property and equipment, net on our consolidated balance sheets. Additionally, we have elected the\nshort-term lease exception for all classes of assets, and therefore do not apply the recognition requirements for\nleases of 12 months or less.\nWe sublease certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the subleases\nare commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the subleases\ngenerally\n87\nTable o f Contents\nrange from four to five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no residual value guarantees\nor other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, we use the applicable incremental\nborrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes of\nperforming lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate represents\nthe rate of interest we would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal\nto the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because we do not generally borrow on a collateralized\nbasis, we use a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for collateralization, current available yield\ncurves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate incremental borrowing rate.\nStock-Based Compensation\nCommon Stock Valuations\nPrior to our IPO, given the absence of a public trading market for our common stock and in accordance with the\nAmerican Institute of Certified Public Accountants Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held\nCompany Equity Securities Issued as Compensation, our board of directors determined the best estimate of fair value\nof our common stock exercising reasonable judgment and considering numerous objective and subjective factors. These\nfactors included:\ncontemporaneous third-party valuations of our common stock;\nthe prices at which we or other holders sold our common and redeemable convertible preferred stock to outside\ninvestors in arms-length transactions;\nthe rights, preferences, and privileges of our redeemable convertible preferred stock relative to those of our\ncommon stock;\nthe price paid by us to repurchase outstanding shares through tender offer;\nour financial condition, results of operations, and capital resources;\nthe industry outlook;\nthe fact that option and RSU grants have involved rights in illiquid securities in a private company;\nthe valuation of comparable companies;\nthe lack of marketability of our common stock;\nthe timing and likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering or a sale of our\ncompany given prevailing market conditions;\nthe history and nature of our business, industry trends, and competitive environment; and\ngeneral economic outlook including economic growth, inflation, unemployment, interest rate environment, and\nglobal economic trends.\nOur board of directors determined the fair value of our common stock by first determining the enterprise value of\nour business, and then allocating the value among the various classes of our equity securities to derive a per\nshare value of our common stock. This process involved the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are\nhighly complex and subjective, such as those regarding our expected future revenue, expenses and future cash flows,\ndiscount rates, market multiples, the selection of comparable companies, and the probability of possible future\nevents. Changes in any or all of these estimates and assumptions or the relationships between those assumptions\nimpacted our valuations as of each valuation date and could have had a material impact on the valuation of our\ncommon stock.\nFor valuations after the completion of the IPO, our board of directors determines the fair value of each share of\nunderlying Class A common stock based on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of\ngrant.\nFair Value of Common Stock Underlying Share-Based Payment Awards\nThe fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant. Estimating\nthe grant date fair value of the common stock underlying RSU grants prior to our IPO was highly judgmental due to\nthe lack of an observable market for our common stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value of the Company’s common\nstock was determined by considering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-\nparty valuations of our\n88\nTable o f Contents\ncommon stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including our IPO), the Company’s operating and\nfinancial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry-specific economic outlook, amongst\nother factors. Estimating the grant date fair value of the RSUs, including the CEO Performance Award discussed\nbelow, was highly sensitive due to the volume of RSUs granted and increasing common stock value as we approached\nthe IPO. With the exception of the CEO Performance Award discussed below, most of our RSUs granted prior to\nNovember 2020 vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting condition and a liquidity event-related\nperformance vesting condition. The fair value of RSUs is recognized as compensation expense over the requisite\nservice period, using the accelerated attribution method, once the liquidity event-related performance vesting\ncondition becomes probable of being achieved. The service-based vesting condition is generally satisfied by the\naward holder providing services to us over a four-year period. The liquidity event-related performance vesting\ncondition was satisfied upon the effectiveness of our IPO registration statement. Stock-based compensation expense\nfor RSUs that had not met the service-based vesting condition as of December 31, 2020 will be recorded over the\nremaining requisite service period. Since November 2020, we have only granted RSUs that vest upon the satisfaction\nof a service-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these RSUs is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, our board of directors granted the CEO Performance Award, an RSU award under our 2014 Stock Plan\nto Mr. Xu for up to 10,379,000 shares of our Class A common stock. The CEO Performance Award vests upon the\nsatisfaction of a service condition and the achievement of certain stock price goals. We estimated the grant date\nfair value of the CEO Performance Award using a model based on multiple stock price paths developed through the use\nof a Monte Carlo simulation that incorporates into the valuation the possibility that the stock price goals may not\nbe satisfied. One of the most judgmental assumptions in the Monte Carlo simulation is the estimated fair value of\nthe common stock underlying the award as discussed above. The average grant date fair value of the CEO Performance\nAward was estimated to be $39.83 per share, and we will recognize total stock-based compensation expense of\napproximately $413 million over the derived service period of each of the nine performance tranches. If the stock\nprice goals are met sooner than the derived service period, we will adjust our stock-based compensation expense to\nreflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested award. Provided that Mr. Xu continues to be our Chief\nExecutive Officer, we will recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period, regardless\nof whether the stock price goals are achieved.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions\nbelieved to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results\nmay differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we\nmay record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if\nnew information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. Upon the\nconclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities\nassumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of\noperations. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nInsurance Reserves\nWe utilize a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance programs to insure costs including auto\nliability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded self-insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred\nbut not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our self-insured ultimate\nobligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. We use assumptions based\non actuarial judgment with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss development factors, which\nincludes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. To limit our exposure to some\nrisks, we maintain additional third-party insurance coverage with varying limits and retentions. We cannot predict\nwhether this third-party insurance will be adequate to cover all potential hazards incidental to our business.\nReserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes\nknown. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved\namounts.\n89\nTable o f Contents\nLoss Contingencies\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of\nbusiness. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages.\nWe record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable\nbut reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount.\nWe review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of\nnegotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal\nmatters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and\nfinancial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nWe record sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated,\nand such reserve is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets.\nWe continue to analyze possible sales tax exposure but do not currently believe that any individual claim or\naggregate claims that might arise will ultimately have a material effect on our results of operations, financial\nposition, or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

          "content": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported\nas a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2019 and 2020, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase\nin interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not\nhedge these interest rate exposures.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business in Canadian dollars and Australian dollars and have international revenue, as well as costs\ndenominated in Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign\ncurrency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income and loss from our\ninternational businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued strengthening of the\nU.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included in our\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n90\nTable o f Contents\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) which is part of stockholders’ equity (deficit).\nInflation Risk\nWe do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial\ncondition.\n91\nTable o f Contents",

Our responsibility is\nto express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting\nfirm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks\nof material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing\nprocedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the\namounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the\naccounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall\npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for\nour opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nEvaluation of self-insurance reserves\nAs discussed in Note 2 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes a combination of third-\nparty insurance and self-insurance programs to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury\nand physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The self-\ninsurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred\nbut not yet reported. The Company’s liability for self-insurance claims as of December 31, 2020 was $55 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's self-insurance reserves as a critical audit matter. The evaluation of\nthe key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and expected loss\nrates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized skill and\nknowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\n93\nTable o f Contents\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We involved actuarial\nprofessionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n● evaluating the qualifications of the Company’s external actuaries by assessing their certifications and\ndetermining whether they met the Qualification Standards of the American Academy of Actuaries\n● assessing the methods used by the Company’s external actuaries by comparing them to actuarial standards of\npractice\n● developing an independent range of the self-insurance reserves by selecting loss development factors and expected\nloss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\nGrant date fair value of restricted stock units (RSUs)\nAs discussed in Note 2 and 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has granted RSUs. Certain RSUs\ncontain a market condition, specifically the CEO Performance Award. The fair value of RSUs are estimated based on\nthe fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. Prior to the Company’s initial public offering,\nthe fair value of the Company’s common stock underlying the RSUs was determined by considering a number of\nobjective and subjective factors, including third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock and sales of the\nCompany’s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock, amongst other factors. The fair value of the CEO\nPerformance Award was estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation due to the market condition. Total stock-based\ncompensation for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $322 million.\nWe identified the evaluation of the estimated grant date fair value of RSUs as a critical audit matter. Subjective\nauditor judgment was required to evaluate the weighting given to third-party valuations of the Company’s common\nstock and sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock that were used to determine the\nfair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. In addition, complex auditor judgment was required\nto evaluate the timing and likelihood of achieving a liquidity event, which were significant assumptions used in\nthe third-party valuations of the Company’s common stock. Specialized skills and knowledge were necessary to\nevaluate the Company’s third-party valuations of its common stock and the CEO Performance Award.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the\ndesign of the internal control related to the weighting given to third-party valuations of the Company’s common\nstock and sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible preferred stock that were used to determine the\nfair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant. We evaluated the Company’s weighting given to third-\nparty valuations of the Company’s common stock and sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock, by assessing:\n● market information related to conditions and events affecting the Company\n● the effect of the Company’s operations on the value of its common stock during the year.\nWe analyzed the timing and likelihood of the Company achieving a liquidity event by (1) inspecting its written\nplans or other relevant documentation, such as minutes and regulatory filings, and (2) assessing its ability to\ncarry out particular courses of action, which included consideration of whether the Company has the financial\nresources and other means to carry out the actions. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and\nknowledge, who assisted in:\n● evaluating the qualifications of the Company's valuation professionals by assessing their certifications and\ndetermining whether they met the qualifications necessary to perform independent common stock and CEO Performance\nAward valuations\n● evaluating the method employed by third party valuation professionals and assumptions used to value the Company’s\ncommon stock\n● developing an independent estimate of the CEO Performance Award and comparing it to the Company’s grant date fair\nvalue.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nMarch 5, 2021\n94\nTable o f Contents\nDoorDash, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in

Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nDescription of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”), is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The\nCompany provides a local logistics platform that enables local brick-and-mortar businesses to address consumers’\nexpectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.\nThe Company’s local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company operates the\nDoorDash Marketplace, which enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting\nthem with consumers (the “Marketplace”). Merchants can either fulfill this demand with independent contractors who\nuse the Company’s platform to deliver orders (“Dashers”) or by in-person pickup by consumers. As part of the\nMarketplace, the Company also offers Pickup, which allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick\nup their orders conveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the\nCompany’s platform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The Marketplace also\nincludes DashPass, the Company’s subscription product, which provides consumers with unlimited access to eligible\nmerchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees. In addition to the Marketplace, the Company offers\nDoorDash Drive, a white-label logistics service that enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through\ntheir own channels to fulfill this demand using the Company’s local logistics platform (“Drive”), and DoorDash\nStorefront that enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a\nturnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or\nlogistics capabilities.\nInitial Public Offering\nOn December 9, 2020, the Company completed its initial public offering (\"IPO\") in which it issued and sold\n33million shares of its Class A common stock at the public offering price of $ 102.00per share. The Company\nreceived net proceeds of $ 3.3billion after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs.\nImmediately prior to the completion of the IPO, all shares of the Company’s outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock automatically converted into 239million shares of its common stock. Additionally, immediately prior\nto the completion of the IPO, the Company filed its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, which\nauthorizes a total of 6.0billion shares of Class A common stock, 200million shares of Class B common stock,\n2.0billion shares of Class C common stock, and 600million shares of preferred stock. Upon the filing of the Amended\nand Restated Certificate of Incorporation, 285million shares of the Company’s common stock were automatically\nreclassified into an equivalent number of shares of the Company’s Class A common stock (the “Reclassification”).\nImmediately after the Reclassification and prior to the completion of the IPO, a total of 31million shares of Class\nA common stock held by Tony Xu, Andy Fang, Stanley Tang, and their respective affiliated trusts were exchanged for\nan equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of certain exchange agreements. As a\nresult, following the completion of the IPO, the Company has three classes of authorized common stock: Class A\ncommon stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, of which Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock were outstanding as of December 31, 2020.\nThe Company granted certain employees restricted stock units (“RSUs”) with both service-based and liquidity event-\nrelated performance vesting conditions (\"IPO Vested RSUs\"). Upon the consummation of the Company’s IPO, the Company\nrecognized $ 279million of stock-based compensation expense for IPO Vested RSUs as the performance vesting\ncondition was satisfied. One share of Class A common stock for each of the IPO Vested RSUs will be delivered on the\napplicable settlement date, which is approximately 180days after the IPO. The future tax benefits on settlement of\nthe above RSUs is not expected to be material as currently the Company has established valuation allowances to\nreduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nTo meet the related tax withholding requirements related to IPO Vested RSUs, for stockholders who elected to net\nshare settle, the Company withheld 65,058shares of Class A common stock subject to the vesting of the IPO Vested\nRSUs and paid $ 7million to the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations as well as any\nincome tax withholding obligations arising as a result of settlement of such shares. Certain employees elected to\nreceive a short-term loan from the Company, with interest that will accrue at the applicable federal rate. The\nshort-term loan extended to employees totaled $ 10million as of December 31, 2020 and is included within prepaid\nexpenses and other current assets on the\n101\nTable o f Contents\nCompany's consolidated balance sheets. The balance of the loan is repayable from the proceeds of sale of shares\ninto the market on the settlement date.\nStock Splits\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors and the stockholders of the Company approved a five-for-one\nforward stock split of the Company’s common stock and redeemable convertible preferred stock (collectively, the\n“Capital Stock”), which became effective on November 9, 2020. The authorized number of each class and series of\nCapital Stock was proportionally increased in accordance with the five-for-one stock split and the par value of\neach class of Capital Stock was not adjusted as a result of this forward stock split. All common stock, redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock, stock options, RSUs, warrants, and per share information presented within these\nconsolidated financial statements have been adjusted to reflect this forward stock split on a retroactive basis for\nall periods presented.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DoorDash, Inc. and its wholly-owned\nsubsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates of America (“GAAP”). All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nReclassifications\nCertain amounts from prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.\nSegments\nOperating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and\nthat is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to\nan individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM.\nThe CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating\ndecisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it\noperates in onereportable segment.See Note 3 for revenue by geography. As of December 31, 2019, long-lived assets\nlocated outside of the United States were not material. As of December 31, 2020, long-lived assets located outside\nof the United States were $ 21million .\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make certain\nestimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related\ndisclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during\nthe period presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances for credit losses,\nestimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website development costs, intangible\nassets, stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other financial instruments, valuation of acquired\nintangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, insurance reserves,\nloss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe Company accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among\nother things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired\nand liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and\nassumptions, especially with respect to the valuation of intangible assets. Management’s estimates of fair value\nare based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as\na result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the\ndate of acquisition, the Company may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a\ncorresponding offset to goodwill if new information is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as\nof the acquisition date. Upon the conclusion of\n102\nTable o f Contents\nthe measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed,\nwhichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash includes demand deposits with banks or financial institutions as well as cash in transit from payment\nprocessors. Cash equivalents include short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months\nor less and their carrying values approximate fair value due to their short-term maturities. Restricted cash\nconsists of collateral provided for letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance\npolicies. As of December 31, 2020, the restricted cash balance was not material.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities primarily consist of commercial paper, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury\nsecurities, and corporate bonds. The Company invests in a diversified portfolio of marketable securities and limits\nthe concentration of its investment in any particular security. Securities with original maturities greater than\nthree months, but less than one year, are included in current assets and securities with original maturities\ngreater than one year are included in non-current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. All marketable\nsecurities are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value.\nIf the estimated fair value of an available-for-sale debt security is below its amortized cost basis, then the\nCompany evaluates the security for impairment. The Company considers its intent to sell the security or whether it\nis more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized basis. If\neither of these criteria are met, the debt security’s amortized cost basis is written down to fair value through\nother income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations. If neither of these criteria are met, the\nCompany evaluates whether unrealized losses have resulted from a credit loss or other factors. The factors\nconsidered in determining whether a credit loss exists can include the extent to which fair value is less than the\namortized cost basis, changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency, any adverse conditions specifically\nrelated to the security, as well as other factors. An impairment relating to credit losses is recorded through an\nallowance for credit losses reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe allowance is limited by the amount that the fair value of the debt security is below its amortized cost basis.\nWhen a credit loss exists, the Company compares the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the\ndebt security with the amortized cost basis of the security to determine what allowance amount, if any, should be\nrecorded. Unrealized losses not resulting from credit losses are recorded through accumulated other comprehensive\nincome (loss).\nFunds Held at Payment Processors\nFunds held at payment processors represent cash due from the Company’s payment processors for cleared transactions\nwith merchants and consumers, as well as funds transferred to payment processors for Dasher payout.\nAccounts Receivable, Net and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants generated through the Company’s Drive\noffering. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which is based on the Company’s assessment of the\ncollectability of accounts. The Company regularly reviews the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses on a\ncollective basis by considering the age of each outstanding invoice, each customer’s expected ability to pay and\ncollection history, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic\nconditions to determine whether the allowance is appropriate. Accounts receivable deemed uncollectible are charged\nagainst the allowance for credit losses when identified.\nThe Company recorded $ 16million of bad debt expense in the year ended December 31, 2020. Write-off in the year\nended December 31, 2020 totaled $ 5million. Bad debt expense was not material in the years ended December 31, 2018\nand 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was $ 2million and $\n13million, respectively.\n103\nTable o f Contents\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated\nuseful lives of the related assets. The useful lives are as follows:\nEstimated Useful Life\nEquipment for merchants             2 years\nComputer equipment and software     2 years\nOffice equipment                    5 years\nCapitalized software and website    2 years\ndevelopment costs\nLeasehold improvements              Shorter of estimated useful life or lease term\nMaintenance and repair costs are charged to expense as incurred. Upon disposal of a fixed asset, the Company\nrecords a gain or loss based on the difference between the proceeds received and the net book value of the disposed\nasset.There were no disposals during the year ended December 31, 2018 and disposals were not material for the years\nended December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets\nacquired in a business combination. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested for impairment at least annually or\nmore frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired. The Company’s\nimpairment tests are based on a single operating segment and reporting unit structure. If the carrying value of the\nreporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the excess of the carrying value of\nthe reporting unit over its fair value.\nThe Company conducted its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2020 and determined that the\nfair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value. Noimpairment charge was recorded in any\nof the periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nIntangible Assets, Net\nIntangible assets are recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and amortized on a straight-line basis\nover their estimated useful lives. The Company reviews identifiable amortizable intangible assets to be held and\nused for impairment under the long-lived asset model described under “Impairment of Long-Lived Assets” below.\nCapitalized Software and Website Development Costs\nThe Company incurred costs relating to the development of the Company’s technology platform, which includes Dasher\nand merchant tools, mobile apps, and website and content development. Software development costs related to\nsoftware acquired, developed, or modified solely to meet the Company’s internal requirements, with no substantive\nplans to market such software at the time of development, are capitalized during the application development stage\nof the project. Costs incurred during the preliminary planning and evaluation stage of the project and during the\npost implementation operational stage are expensed as incurred. Costs to develop the Company’s technology platform\nare capitalized when preliminary development efforts are successfully completed, management has authorized and\ncommitted project funding, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used as\nintended. Costs incurred for enhancements that are expected to result in additional functionality are capitalized\nand expensed over the estimated useful life of the upgrades on a per project basis.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates its long-lived assets or asset groups for indicators of possible impairment by comparison of\nthe carrying amount to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such asset or asset group\nwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be\nrecoverable. Should an impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value\nof the asset or asset group over the asset’s or asset group’s fair value generally determined by estimates of\nfuture discounted cash flows. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair\nvalue less costs to sell. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized an impairment of $\n11million related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with its former headquarters, which the\nCompany subleased to another company.\n104\nTable o f Contents\nInsurance Reserves\nThe Company utilizes a combination of third-party insurance and self-insurance programs to insure costs including\nauto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a\ncertain dollar retention limit. The recorded self-insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred\nbut not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s self-insured\nultimate obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. The Company\nutilizes assumptions based on actuarial judgment with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss\ndevelopment factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. To\nlimit exposure to some risks, the Company maintains additional insurance coverage with varying limits and\nretentions. The Company cannot predict whether this insurance will be adequate to cover all potential hazards\nincidental to its business. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or\nnew information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from the Company’s estimates, which could\nresult in losses over the Company’s reserved amounts.\nLoss Contingencies\nThe Company is involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in connection with\nits business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of\ndamages. The Company records a liability in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated\nbalance sheets when the Company believes that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or\nrange can be reasonably estimated. The Company discloses material contingencies when it believes that a loss is not\nprobable but reasonably possible. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated\namount. The Company reviews these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjusts these provisions accordingly to\nreflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\nSales and Indirect Taxes\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities when they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. Sales and indirect tax liabilities are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized\ngains and losses on available-for-sale marketable securities. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign\nsubsidiaries are translated from their functional currency, which is typically the local currency, into U.S.\ndollars. Assets and liabilities are translated at period end rates of exchange, and revenue and expenses are\ntranslated using average monthly exchange rates. The resulting gain or loss is included in accumulated other\ncomprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses included as a separate\ncomponent of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nStock-Based Compensation\nThe Company estimates the fair value of stock options granted to employees and directors using the Black-Scholes\noption-pricing model. The fair value of stock options is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line\nbasis over the requisite service period, which is typically four years.\nThe Black-Scholes model considers several variables and assumptions in estimating the fair value of stock-based\nawards. These variables include:\nper share fair value of the underlying common stock;\nexercise price;\nexpected term;\nrisk-free interest rate;\nexpected stock price volatility over the expected term; and\nexpected annual dividend yield.\n105\nTable o f Contents\nFor all stock options granted, the Company calculated the expected term using the simplified method for “plain\nvanilla” stock option awards. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-\ncoupon issues similar in duration to the expected term of the stock-based award. The Company’s common stock is not\npublicly traded, and therefore, the Company used the historical volatility of the stock price of similar publicly\ntraded peer companies. The Company utilized a dividend yield of zero, as it had no history or plan of declaring\ndividends on its common stock.\nThe fair value of RSUs is estimated based on the fair value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.\nPrior to November 2020, RSUs granted by the Company vest upon the satisfaction of both a service-based vesting\ncondition, which is typically four years, and a liquidity event-related performance vesting condition. The\nliquidity event-related performance vesting condition was achieved upon the consummation of the Company's IPO, and\nthe Company recorded a cumulative stock-based compensation expense of $ 279million as of the IPO date for those\nRSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been satisfied. Stock-based compensation related to the\nremaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied will\nbe recorded over the remaining requisite service period using the accelerated attribution method. Since November\n2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award (as discussed further in Note 12), the Company only granted\nRSUs that vest upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition and the compensation expense for these\nRSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nFor the CEO Performance Award that includes a market condition, the fair value of the award is determined using a\nMonte Carlo simulation model. The associated stock-based compensation is recorded over the derived service period,\nusing the accelerated attribution method. If the stock price goals are met sooner than the derived service period,\nthe Company will adjust the stock-based compensation expense to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the\nvested award. Provided that Tony Xu continues to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Company, Stock-based\ncompensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period, regardless of whether the stock price goals\nare achieved.\nPrior to the IPO, the fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options and RSUs has\nhistorically been determined by the Company’s board of directors as there is no public market for the underlying\ncommon stock. The Company’s board of directors determined the fair value of the Company’s common stock by\nconsidering a number of objective and subjective factors including: contemporaneous third-party valuations of its\ncommon stock, the valuation of comparable companies, sales of the Company’s common and redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to outside investors in arms-length transactions (including the IPO), the Company’s operating and\nfinancial performance, the lack of marketability, and the general and industry specific economic outlook, amongst\nother factors. After the completion of the IPO, the fair value of the Company's Class A common stock is determined\nbased on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") closing price on the date of grant.\nThe Company records forfeitures when they occur for all share-based payment awards.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred income tax\nassets and liabilities are recorded based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial\nstatement and income tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. These differences are measured using the enacted\nstatutory tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income for the years in which differences are expected to\nreverse. The Company recognizes the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates in the period that\nincludes the enactment date. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the net\namount that it believes is more-likely-than-not to be realized. Management considers all available evidence, both\npositive and negative, including historical levels of income, expectations and risks associated with estimates of\nfuture taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance.\nThe Company operates in various tax jurisdictions and is subject to audit by tax authorities. The Company\nrecognizes the tax benefit of an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position is\nsustainable upon examination by the taxing authority, based on the technical merits. The tax benefit recognized is\nmeasured as the largest amount of benefit which is greater than 50% likely to be realized upon settlement with the\ntaxing authority. The Company recognizes interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the\nprovision for income taxes.\nFair Value\nThe Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis based on an expected exit\nprice, which represents the amount that would be received on the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability\nin an orderly\n106\nTable o f Contents\ntransaction between market participants. As such, fair value may be based on assumptions that market participants\nwould use in pricing an asset or liability.\nThe authoritative guidance on fair value measurements establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value\non either a recurring or nonrecurring basis, whereby inputs used in valuation techniques, are assigned a\nhierarchical level. The following are the hierarchical levels of inputs to measure fair value:\nLevel 1    Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in\nactive markets.\nInputs reflect quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active;\nLevel 2    quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; inputs other than quoted prices\nthat are observable for the assets or liabilities; or inputs that are derived principally from or\ncorroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nUnobservable inputs reflecting the Company’s own assumptions incorporated in valuation techniques\nLevel 3    used to determine fair value. These assumptions are required to be consistent with market\nparticipant assumptions that are reasonably available.\nThe carrying amounts of certain of the Company’s financial instruments, which include cash equivalents, accounts\nreceivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, and accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities. The carrying value of the Company’s\nconvertible promissory notes entered into in February 2020, which are recorded at amortized cost, approximates fair\nvalue as the stated interest rate approximates market rates for similar loans.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company’s cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, funds held at payment processors, and accounts\nreceivable are potentially subject to concentration of credit risk. Although the Company deposits its cash with\nmultiple financial institutions, the deposits, at times, may exceed federally insured limits. Management believes\nthat the institutions are financially stable and, accordingly, minimal credit risk exists. The Company limits\npurchases of debt securities to investment-grade securities. The Company has not experienced any significant credit\nlosses historically.\nThe Company relies on a limited number of third parties to provide payment processing services (“payment\nprocessors”) including collecting amounts due from end-users and processing Dasher payouts. Payment processors are\nfinancial institutions or credit card companies that the Company believes are of high credit quality. The Company\nretains the risk of collecting such amounts from the payment processor, which are included in funds held at payment\nprocessors for the unsettled portion at each period end. The portion of the payments to be remitted to Dashers and\nmerchants is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. Although the Company pre-authorizes forms\nof payment to mitigate its exposure, the Company absorbs all credit card losses.\nAccounts receivable, net primarily represents receivables from merchants that were generated through the Company’s\nDrive offering.As of December 31, 2019, two entities individually accounted for 26% and 11% of accounts receivable,\nnet, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, three entities in dividually accounted for 20%, 14%, and 10% of\naccounts receivable, net, respectively. No customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting\nStandards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue from Contracts with its Customers. The Company generates a substantial\nmajority of its revenue from orders completed through the DoorDash Marketplace and the related commissions charged\nto partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into\na contractual agreement with DoorDash. Revenue from the DoorDash Marketplace is recognized at the point in time\nwhen the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. The Company also generates revenue from membership\nfees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of the DoorDash Marketplace. Revenue generated\nfrom the Company’s DashPass subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is\ngenerally one monthto one yeardepending on the type of subscription purchased by the consumer. In addition, the\nCompany also generates revenue from its Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use its\nlocal logistics platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels.\nRevenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\n107\nTable o f Contents\nWhen determining the appropriate accounting for the fees collected in exchange for the use of the Company’s local\nlogistics platform, the Company considered its contractual arrangements with the parties involved as well as its\ncustomary business practices. Under the Company’s agreements with partner merchants, the Company agrees to a\ncommission to be earned as a percentage of the total dollar value of goods ordered. When a consumer signs up to use\nthe Company’s local logistics platform, the consumer agrees to be charged certain fees, at the time an order is\nplaced, in exchange for use of the platform. The Company has concluded that a contract exists between the Company\nand a partner merchant when the partner merchant accepts each consumer’s order, and a contract exists between the\nCompany and a consumer when the consumer places the order and requests delivery services. The duration of a\ncontract is typically equal to the time between when the order is placed and a Dasher picks up the food from the\nmerchant. Contracts including variable consideration with partner merchants were not material for the periods\npresented.\nThe Company’s local logistics platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the\nCompany’s platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. The Company has determined that\nthe order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and has\ntherefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation\nservice and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item\nseparately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable\nas the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service\nindividually, rather than as a combined item.\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nJudgment is required in determining whether the Company is the principal or the agent in transactions with partner\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery\nfacilitation services, the Company evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on\nwhether it controls each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in DoorDash Marketplace\ntransactions.\nWith respect to order facilitation services, the Company has determined it is an agent for partner merchants in\nfacilitating the sale of products to the consumer through the DoorDash Marketplace. The consumer accesses the\nCompany’s local logistics platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders\nare picked up from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. The Company does not control the\nproducts prior to them being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to\nanother consumer nor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\nWith respect to delivery facilitation services, the Company has determined it is acting as an agent for the\nconsumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As the Company’s role with\nthe delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to prospective\nDashers, it does not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\nAs the Company is an agent in facilitating the sale of products and delivery services, the Company reports revenue\non a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. Dasher\npayout represents the amounts paid to Dashers for deliveries, including incentives and tips, except for certain\nreferral bonuses. From time to time, Dashers may request an earlier payment settlement in exchange for a reduction\nin Dasher payout. The amounts payable to merchants and Dashers are included in accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as payments are typically settled on a weekly basis.\nThe Company recognizes revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed\ntransaction. The Company satisfies its performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful\nsale of the merchant’s products and meets its performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up\nthe products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\nDoorDash also provides value-add services to merchants. These services are generally considered separate\nperformance obligations and revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. Revenue generated\nfrom such services is not material in all periods presented.\nGift Cards\nThe Company sells gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through its Marketplace. Proceeds from the sale of\ngift cards are deferred and recorded as contract liabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its\nplatform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts\ncollected from consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\n108\nTable o f Contents\nRefunds and Credits\nFrom time to time the Company issues credits or refunds to merchants and consumers to ameliorate issues that may\narise with orders. The Company accounts for such refunds as variable consideration and therefore records the amount\nof each refund or credit issued as a reduction of revenue.\nIncentive Programs\nThe Company offers incentives to attract consumers and Dashers to use its local logistics platform. Consumers\ntypically receive credits or discounted delivery fees while Dashers typically receive cash incentives. Each of the\nincentives are described below:\nConsumer Promotions\nThe Company uses promotions in tandem with sales and marketing spend to attract new consumers to its platform.\nPromotions offered to consumers are primarily recorded as a reduction of revenue and include the following:\nNew consumer incentives: The Company records discounts and incentives provided to new consumers as a promotion and\nreduces revenue on the date that the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nConsumer referrals: The Company offers referral credits to its existing consumers for referrals of new consumers.\nThese referral credits are paid in exchange for a distinct marketing service and therefore the portion of these\ncredits that is equal to or less than the fair value of acquiring a new consumer are accounted for as a consumer\nacquisition cost. These new consumer acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and reflected as sales and\nmarketing expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations. The portion of these credits in excess\nof the fair value of acquiring a new consumer is accounted for as a reduction of revenue.\nExisting consumer incentives: On occasion, the Company offers promotional discounts to existing consumers. The\nCompany records incentives provided to existing consumers as a promotion and reduces revenue on the date that the\ncorresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nThe Company offers various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce\nrevenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\nPeak pay : The Company makes additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities\nduring peak demand time.\nDasher referrals : The Company offers referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once\nthe new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. The Company expenses the fair value of payments made to the\nreferring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in the consolidated statements of operations, since\nthe marketing of the Company’s platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to the Company. The\nportion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is\naccounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout\nand reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of\nrebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, costs related to placing orders\nwith non-partner merchants, and insurance expenses, (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding\nmerchants and Dashers, costs for providing support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform\ninfrastructure costs, and (iii) personnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nthe Company’s local operations, support, and other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation\nexpenses primarily include salary, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is\ndetermined based on an allocation of shared costs, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and\ninformation technology costs, among all departments based on employee headcount. As such, allocated shared costs\nare reflected in each of the expense categories.\nSales and Marketing\n109\nTable o f Contents\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the\nreferrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing\nexpenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense\nincluding amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.Advertising expenses were $\n81million, $ 446million, and $ 698million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data\nanalytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to the Company’s platform, as well as\nexpenses associated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include\nlitigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nadministrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated\nwith fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, acquisition-related expenses, and allocated\noverhead.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with\nthe Company’s property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with\nequipment for merchants, including equipment for merchants under finance leases, computer equipment and software,\noffice equipment, and leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with the Company’s\ncapitalized software and website development costs, as well as acquired intangible assets. Depreciation and\namortization are excluded from cost of revenue and operating expenses.\nNet Loss Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per common share following the two-class method required for multiple classes of\ncommon stock and participating securities. The Company considers its previously outstanding redeemable convertible\npreferred stock to be participating securities. The two-class method requires income (loss) available to common\nstockholders for the period to be allocated between multiple classes of common stock and participating securities\nbased upon their respective rights to receive dividends as if all income (loss) for the period had been\ndistributed. The holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock would be entitled to dividends in\npreference to common stockholders, at specified rates, if declared. Such dividends are not cumulative. Any\nremaining earnings would be distributed among the holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock and common\nstock pro rata on an as-converted basis. These holders of the Company’s redeemable convertible preferred stock are\nnot contractually obligated to participate in the Company’s losses. As such, the Company’s net losses for the years\nended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020 were not allocated to these participating securities. The rights, including\nthe liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock\nare substantially identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock shared proportionately in the Company’s net losses. Noshares of Class C common stock were issued and\noutstanding as of December 31, 2020. Prior to the completion of the IPO, there were noshares of Class B common\nstock issued and outstanding.\nBasic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period, less shares subject to repurchase. The\ndiluted net loss per share is computed by giving effect to all potentially dilutive securities outstanding for the\nperiod. For periods in which the Company reports net losses, diluted net loss per common share is the same as basic\nnet loss per common share, because all potentially dilutive securities are anti-dilutive. Vested RSUs that have not\nbeen settled have been included in the appropriate common share class used to calculate basic net loss per share.\nUpon completion of the Company's IPO, all of the Company’s outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred\nstock were automatically converted into 239million shares of common stock and their carrying amount reclassified\ninto stockholders' (deficit) equity. As of December 31, 2020, there were noshares of redeemable convertible\npreferred stock issued and outstanding.\nDeferred Offering Costs\n110\nTable o f Contents\nDeferred offering costs, which consist of direct incremental legal, consulting, accounting, and other fees relating\nto the anticipated sale of the Company’s common stock in the IPO, are initially capitalized and recorded in other\nassets on the consolidated balance sheets.As of December 31, 2019, deferred offering costs capitalized was $\n5million. After the IPO, all deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholders' (deficit) equity as a\nreduction of the IPO proceeds on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\nThe Company applies the guidance in Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC\n842”). The Company adopted ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, using the modified retrospective transition method and used\nthe effective date as the date of initial application. Consequently, financial information is not updated and the\ndisclosures required under ASC 842 are not provided for dates and periods before January 1, 2019. The Company\nelected the package of practical expedients available in the leasing transition guidance, and therefore did not\nreassess whether existing or expired contracts contain leases, lease classification, or initial direct costs.\nAdditionally, the Company has elected the practical expedient to not separate lease and non-lease components for\nall of the Company’s leases. The Company also has elected the short-term lease exception for all classes of assets,\nand therefore does not apply the recognition requirements for leases of 12 months or less. Expense related to\nshort-term leases is recognized either straight-line over the lease term or as incurred depending on whether the\nlease payments are fixed or variable. Variable lease payments were not material for the years ended December 31,\n2019 and 2020. The Company did not utilize the practical expedient allowing the use of hindsight in determining the\nlease term and in assessing impairment of its operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. A contract is or contains a lease if\nit conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration.\nThe Company’s classes of assets that are leased include real estate leases and equipment leases. Operating leases\nconsist of real estate leases and are included in operating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities on the\nCompany’s consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases consist of equipment leases and are included in property and\nequipment, net on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets.\nThe Company’s real estate leases are for an initial period between oneand 15years, and typically include renewal\noptions, the election of which is at the option of the Company. The Company includes renewal options in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities only to the extent the option is reasonably certain to be exercised. For leases\nthat provide the option to terminate, the lease term includes periods covered by such options to the extent the\nCompany is reasonably certain not to exercise the option.\nThe Company subleases certain portions of buildings subject to operating leases. The terms and conditions of the\nsubleases are commensurate with the terms and conditions within the original operating leases. The term of the\nsubleases generally range from fourto five years, payments are fixed within the contracts, and there are no\nresidual value guarantees or other restrictions or covenants in the leases.\nWhen the discount rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined, the Company uses the applicable\nincremental borrowing rate at lease commencement in order to discount lease payments to present value for purposes\nof performing lease classification tests and measuring the lease liability. The incremental borrowing rate\nrepresents the rate of interest the Company would have to pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar\nterm an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. Because the Company does not\ngenerally borrow on a collateralized basis, it uses a derived unsecured synthetic credit rating adjusted for\ncollateralization, current available yield curves, and the lease term as inputs to derive an appropriate\nincremental borrowing rate.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Adopted\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of\nCredit Losses on Financial Instruments” (\"ASU 2016-13\"). The new guidance requires the measurement and recognition\nof expected credit losses for financial assets held at amortized costs. ASU 2016-13 replaces the existing incurred\nloss impairment model with an expected loss model which requires the use of forward-looking information to\ncalculate credit loss estimates. It also eliminates the concept of other-than-temporary impairment and requires\ncredit losses related to certain available-for-sale debt securities to be recorded through an allowance for credit\nlosses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the securities. Effective on December 31, 2020,\nthe Company lost its emerging growth company (\"EGC\") status which accelerated the requirement of the adoption of\nASU 2016-13. As a result, the Company adopted 2016-13 using the modified retrospective approach as of January 1,\n2020. The cumulative effect upon adoption was not material to its consolidated financial statement.\n111\nTable o f Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income\nTaxes\", which eliminates certain exceptions related to the approach for intra-period tax allocation, the\nmethodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for\noutside basis differences. The new guidance also simplifies aspects of the accounting for franchise taxes and\nenacted changes in tax laws or rates and clarifies the accounting for transactions that result in a step-up in the\ntax basis of goodwill. For public business entities, this standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim\nperiods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. Early adoption is permitted. This guidance\nwas effective for the Company beginning on January 1, 2021 and is not expected to have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements and related disclosures.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, \"Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and\nDerivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40)\" which removes separation models for\nconvertible debt with a cash conversion feature and convertible instruments with a beneficial conversion feature.\nSuch convertible debt will be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost and convertible\npreferred stock will be accounted for as a single equity instrument measured at its historical cost, as long as no\nother features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. The update also requires the if-converted method\nto be used for convertible instruments and the effect of potential share settlement be included in the diluted\nearnings per share calculation when an instrument may be settled in cash or shares. For public business entities,\nthe standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within those\nfiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption\nof the update on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-10, \"Codification Improvements\", which improves the Codification by\nhaving all disclosure-related guidance available in the Disclosure Sections of the Codification and also contains\nCodification improvements that vary in nature. For public business entities, this amendment is effective for fiscal\nyears beginning after December 15, 2020. The amendments in this Update should be applied retrospectively. The\nCompany does not believe the amendments will have a material impact on the disclosures to its consolidated\nfinancial statement.\n3. Revenue\nThe following tables present the Company’s revenue disaggregated by offering and by geographical region.\nRevenue by offering was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019        2020\nCore business    $                      282    $   876    $  2,886\nOther revenue                             9          9           —\nTotal revenue    $                      291    $   885    $  2,886\nCore business is primarily comprised of Marketplace, which includes Pickup and DoorDash for Work, and Drive.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of DashPass, the\naddress of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019        2020\nUnited States    $                      282    $   877    $  2,875\nInternational                             9          8          11\nTotal revenue    $                      291    $   885    $  2,886\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\nconsolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from consumers\nfor DashPass subscriptions, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is\nrecognized over time. The contract liabilities balance was $ 13million and $ 108million as of December 31, 2019 and\n2020, respectively, and the increase was primarily driven by increased sales of gift card in the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020.\n112\nTable o f Contents\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nAmortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing expense\nand amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of revenue,\nexclusive of depreciation and amortization in the consolidated statements of operations. A summary of activities\nrelated to deferred contract costs was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019       2020\nBeginning balance                          $                        2    $     6    $    21\nCapitalization of deferred contract                                 5         19         32\ncosts\nAmortization of deferred contract costs                            -1         -4        -10\nEnding balance                             $                        6    $    21    $    43\nDeferred contract costs, current           $                        2    $     4    $    16\nDeferred contract costs, non-current                                4         17         27\nTotal deferred contract costs              $                        6    $    21    $    43\n4. Acquisitions\nCaviar Acquisition\nOn October 31, 2019, the Company acquired Caviar in an effort to help grow its business, advance its strategy of\noffering consumers differentiated merchant selection, and enable the Company to cater to even more food preferences\nand occasions. The acquisition has been accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition\ndate fair value of the consideration transferred was $ 411million, which consisted of $ 311million in cash,\nincluding $ 1million in seller transaction costs settled at closing, and $ 100million of the Company’s Series G\nredeemable convertible preferred stock. The Company’s acquisition-related costs were $ 5million and all costs were\nrecorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s consolidated statements of operations during the\nperiod in which they were incurred.\nThe total purchase consideration of the Caviar acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition.\nManagement determined the fair values based on a number of factors, including a valuation from an independent\nthird-party valuation firm. The excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill is attributable to the assembled workforce and anticipated synergies from the future growth and strategic\nadvantages in the food delivery industry. The goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Caviar is\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nOctober 31, 2019\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets         $                 4\nIntangible assets                                                 106\nGoodwill                                                          305\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities                     -3\nOther liabilities                                                  -1\nTotal purchase price                              $               411\nThe following table sets forth the components of identifiable intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their\nestimated useful lives as of the date of acquisition (in years):\n113\nTable o f Contents\nEstimated\nUseful\nLife                  October 31, 2019\nExisting technology                             1.5    $                45\nVendor relationships                           13.0                     45\nCourier relationships                           1.5                      1\nCustomer relationships                          3.0                      9\nTrade name and trademarks                       3.0                      6\nTotal acquired intangible assets                       $               106\nExisting technology acquired primarily consists of Caviar’s online and mobile platform for restaurant pickup and\ndelivery orders. The estimated fair value of the existing technology and vendor relationships was determined based\non the present value of the expected cash flows to be generated by each existing technology and existing vendor\nrespectively. The Company expects to amortize the fair value of these intangible assets on a straight-line basis\nover their respective estimated useful lives.\nIncluded within the prepaid expenses and other current assets acquired is an indemnification asset of $ 3million,\nwhich relates to a corresponding assumed liability of $ 3million related to a probable and estimable legal\nsettlement for which Square, Inc. has provided an indemnification to the Company.\nThe amount of revenue from Caviar included in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December\n31, 2019 was $ 15million.\nThe following unaudited pro forma results presents the combined revenue and net loss as if the Caviar acquisition\nhad been completed on January 1, 2018, the beginning of the comparable annual reporting period. The unaudited pro\nforma information is based on estimates and assumptions which the Company believes are reasonable and primarily\nreflects adjustments for the pro forma impact of additional amortization related to the fair value of acquired\nintangible assets and transaction costs. The unaudited pro forma results are presented for informational purposes\nonly and are not necessarily indicative of what the actual results of operations of the combined company would have\nbeen if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the periods presented, nor are they indicative of future\nresults of operations. The unaudited pro forma results were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019\nRevenue     $                      361    $   971\nNet loss                          -291       -726\nOther Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Scotty Labs, Inc., which was\naccounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred was $ 5million. The total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, which primarily consisted of $ 4million of intangible assets. The identifiable\nintangible assets acquired consisted entirely of existing technology, which has an estimated remaining useful life\nof 2years as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, the Company recorded $ 1million of goodwill, which represented the\nexcess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired.\nIn December 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares of a technology manufacturing\ncompany, which was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The total purchase consideration was\napproximately $ 30million, of which $ 3million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The\ntotal purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed,\nwhich primarily consisted of $ 22million of intangible assets.

Leases\nThe Company leases its facilities under non-cancelable lease agreements which expire between 2021 and 2035. Certain\nof these arrangements have free rent, escalating rent payment provisions, lease renewal options, and tenant\nallowances. Under such arrangements, the Company recognizes a ROU asset and lease liability on the consolidated\nbalance sheets. Rent expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the non-cancelable lease term. The Company\nalso leased equipment for merchants under finance lease agreements and such assets were recorded within property\nand equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Most of the Company’s leases are operating leases, and\nactivities related to finance leases were not material for the periods presented.\nRent expense, net of sublease income, was $ 10million, $ 29million, and $ 46million during the years ended December\n31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.\nIn June 2019, the Company subleased its previous headquarters office space to another company (the “Sublessee”).\nThe sublease required Sublessee to pay 100% of any rent and other related expenses due and payable under the\nexisting lease with the landlord (the “Head Lease”), however the Company was not relieved from its legal obligation\nto the landlord under the Head Lease. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019, an operating lease liability and an\noperating lease ROU asset was reflected on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets related to the Head Lease.\nPrior to April 2020, all payments due and payable by Sublessee were made timely.\nIn early April 2020, as a result of a disruption to Sublessee’s business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Sublessee\ninformed the Company that it would not be making any future monthly rent payments. Accordingly, the Company ceased\nrecognizing sublease income beginning in April 2020, and further determined that an impairment existed and\nrecognized an impairment charge of $ 11million during the year ended December 31, 2020, reducing the carrying value\nof the ROU asset to its estimated fair value. Fair value of the ROU asset was estimated using an income-approach\nbased on forecasted future cash flows expected to be derived from the property based on current sublease market\nrent. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was continuing its efforts to obtain a subtenant for this space.\nThe components of lease costs related to the Company’s operating leases included in the consolidated statements of\noperations for the periods presented were as follows (in millions):\n118\nTable o f Contents\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020\nOperating lease cost     $                       22    $    40\nShort-term lease cost                            10         11\nSublease income                                  -3         -5\nTotal lease cost         $                       29    $    46\nLease terms and discount rates for operating leases were as follows:\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2019            2020\nWeighted-average remaining lease term            10.2            10.7\n(in years)\nWeighted-average discount rate                  7.12%           8.06%\nSupplemental cash flow and non-cash information was as follows (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2019       2020\nCash paid for amounts included in the\nmeasurement of lease liabilities\nOperating cash flows for operating         $                       12    $    32\nleases\nFinancing cash flows for finance leases    $                        1    $     —\nROU assets obtained in exchange for new\nlease liabilities\nOperating leases                           $                      137    $    69\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company had entered into long term non-cancelable real estate lease contracts\nof $ 246million and $ 120million, respectively, for which leases have not yet commenced.

Promissory Notes\n2017 Convertible Promissory Notes\nIn September and December 2017, the Company entered into Note Purchase Agreements pursuant to which the Company\nissued convertible promissory notes with an aggregate principal amount of $ 60million (the “Notes”) to twoexisting\ninvestors and onenew investor. The Notes accrued interest at the rate of 1.29% per annum. The Notes could be\nredeemed or converted into redeemable convertible preferred stock upon either, (i) a change in control, or (ii) an\nequity financing of at least $ 50million. The Notes could also be accelerated upon the occurrence of a customary\nevent of default. In 2018, the Company issued Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, thereby satisfying\nthe Notes’ conversion condition. As a result, the outstanding principal and accrued interest of $ 60million\nconverted into a total of 11,752,210shares of Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock, which were converted\ninto Class A common stock upon the Company's IPO.\nPromissory Note Issued to Not-for-Profit Organization\nIn October 2019, the Company entered into a $ 30million promissory note (the “Promissory Note”) with a third-party\nnot-for-profit organization to support a 2020 ballot initiative in California. The Promissory Note does not bear\ninterest, and the Company has rights to demand repayment to the extent such funds have not been spent by the not-\nfor-profit organization. The Promissory Note, less any amounts spent, is payable to the Company upon the earlier of\n(i) the Company demanding a repayment or (ii) by December 31, 2020. The Company initially recorded the Promissory\nNote as a prepaid expense and other current asset on the consolidated balance sheet and the Company’s portion of\namounts spent by the not-for-profit organization are recorded as general and administrative expenses as the funds\nare spent. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the Promissory Note was $ 29million, and was recorded in\nprepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying\nvalue of the Promissory Note was zeroas it was spent in full. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020,\nthe Company recorded $ 1million and $ 29million, respectively, in general and administrative expenses in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\n2020 Convertible Promissory Notes\nIn February 2020, the Company issued convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 340million with an\ninitial maturity date in March 2025 (the “2020 Notes”). The Company received net proceeds of $ 333million, net of $\n2million in debt issuance costs, reflecting an original issue discount on the principal of $ 5million. The interest\nrate is 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. At the election of the Company, interest is to be paid in\ncash or by increasing the principal amount of the 2020 Notes by payment-in-kind. The 2020 Notes will be\nautomatically converted upon the later of (i) the one-yearanniversary of the issuance date of the 2020 Notes and\n(ii) the trading day that is the tenth trading day immediately following the date of a Qualified Public Company\nEvent ((i) and (ii), in either case, the “initial conversion date”). A Qualified Public Company Event for purposes\nof the 2020 Notes means any transaction, including a direct listing or an initial public offering, that (a) results\nin the Company’s common stock being registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and\nlisted on the NYSE, the Nasdaq Global Select Market, or the Nasdaq Global Market and (b) in connection with a firm\ncommitment underwritten initial public offering with net proceeds of at least $ 100million. If, following a\nQualified Public Company Event, the conversion reference price for the 2020 Notes implies a market capitalization\nfor the Company that is less than $ 10billion, the 2020 Notes will automatically convert into a new non-convertible\nnote bearing identical terms to the 2020 Notes (other than with respect to conversion), which is prepayable without\npenalty at the Company’s option at any time. For purposes of the 2020 Notes, the “conversion reference price” means\nthe arithmetic average of the daily volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock for the ten trading\ndays immediately prior to the initial conversion date. If, following a Qualified Public Company Event, the\nconversion reference price for the 2020 Notes implies a market capitalization for the Company greater than $\n10billion, the 2020 Notes will automatically convert into shares of the Company’s common stock over a 40-trading\nday period based on the daily volume-weighted average price per share of the Company’s common stock during such\nperiod; provided, the Company may, in its sole discretion, elect to deliver cash in lieu of shares of common stock\nin connection with such conversion.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the 2020 Notes had a carrying value of $ 364million on the consolidated balance sheets,\nconsisting of the unpaid principal balance of $ 340million, plus unpaid accrued payment-in-kind interest of $\n30million, net of unamortized debt issuance costs of $ 1million and unamortized original issue discount of $\n5million. The Company amortizes the debt issuance costs and the original issue discount over the period until the\ninitial maturity date of the 2020 Notes. Amortization of debt issuance costs and the original issue discount were\nnot material for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n120\nTable o f Contents\n10. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,\nand such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex\nOperations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”) . The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that\nwas signed into law in September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an\nadverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased\nlegal proceedings and related expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business\nmodel and operations. Further, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar\nto the test set forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification.\nOn November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia\nalleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act with respect to the Company’s\nDasher pay model that was in effect from approximately September 2017 through September 2019. On November 24, 2020,\nthe Company agreed to a Consent Order and Judgment that resolved the matter with the Company paying $ 3million. The\nConsent Order and Judgment was signed by the Court on November 30, 2020. The Company recorded a $ 3million expense\nin the consolidated statements of operations within general and administrative expense during the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020 for this case.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nconducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the\nclassification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, and other matters.\nIn October 2019, the Company made an offer, and in December 2019 it filed a settlement agreement, of $ 40million\nwith the representatives of Dashers that had filed actions in the States of California and Massachusetts in order\nto settle claims under the Private Attorney General Act and class action claims alleging worker misclassification\nof Dashers against the Company. These actions were filed by and on behalf of Massachusetts Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since August\n2016. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be\npaid by the Company from $ 40million to $ 41million. In October 2020, the Company entered into an amended\nsettlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by the Company from $ 41million to $ 89million.\nIn March 2020, the Company reached an agreement to resolve worker misclassification claims associated with certain\nDashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the Company. Under the\nagreement, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers are eligible for settlement payments, subject to a\nthreshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements. The Company anticipates\nthat the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these individual settlement\nagreements, including attorneys’ fees, will be approximately $ 70million. In July 2020, the Company transferred $\n69million into an escrow account, the settlement amount will be released and paid to claimants and claimants’\nattorneys if a minimum number of claimants agree to release their claims against the Company by the date specified\nwithin the settlement agreement. In December 2020, the number of claimants who agreed to release their claims\nagainst the Company exceeded the minimum and the Company is committed to release the settlement amount in the\nescrow account to claimants and claimants' attorneys in the first quarter of 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the\nsettlement amount was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn July and August 2020, the Company reached additional agreements to resolve worker misclassification claims\nassociated with certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the\nCompany. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers are eligible for settlement\npayments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements.\nThe Company\n121\nTable o f Contents\nanticipates that the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these individual\nsettlement agreements, including attorneys’ fees, will be approximately $ 16million.\nThe Company recorded the impact of these worker misclassification settlements in the respective period in which the\nclaims relate, resulting in general and administrative expense of $ 11million, $ 68million, and $ 83million for the\nyears ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees\nin violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This\naction is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the Company from continuing\nto classify Dashers as independent contractors. In August 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed a motion\nfor preliminary injunction that would bar the Company from continuing to classify Dashers in California as\nindependent contractors during the pendency of this case. In December 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney\nwithdrew its request for preliminary injunction. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred;\nhowever, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these\nindemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the\nindividual.\nNoliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2019 and 2020.\nNon-cancelable Purchase Commitments\nThe Company has non-cancelable purchase commitments, which primarily relate to the purchase of onboarding, data\nprocessing, technology platform infrastructure, and advertising services. These purchase commitments are not\nrecorded as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2020 as the Company has not\nyet received the related services. As of December 31, 2020, the future minimum payments under the Company’s non-\ncancelable purchase commitments were as follows (in millions):\nYear Ending December 31,            Amount\n2021                                   119\n2022                                   112\n2023                                   104\n2024                                    79\n2025                                     2\nTotal future minimum payments    $     416\nBank Commitments and Letters of Credit\nIn October 2019, the Company entered into letters of credit, established primarily for real estate leases and\ninsurance policies. The reimbursement obligations under these letters of credit are secured by cash held in\nrestricted depository accounts. As of December 31, 2019 the Company had $ 30million of letters of credit\noutstanding. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company terminated these letters of credit.\nAdditionally, in November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provides\nfor a $ 300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. Loans under the credit\nfacility bear interest, at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal\n122\nTable o f Contents\nfunds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a one-month\ninterest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also\nobligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees,\nan upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative\ncovenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as\ncustomary negative covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions,\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and\nacquisitions, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\nIn August 2020, the Company amended and restated its existing revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide\nfor $ 100million of incremental revolving loan commitments, effective upon consummation of an IPO of the Company’s\ncommon stock on or prior to August 7, 2021, for total revolving commitments of $ 400million. The amendment and\nrestatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from November 19, 2024 to August 7,\n2025.\nAs of December 31, 2019 and 2020, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit agreement. As\nof December 31, 2019, there were noamounts drawn related to this agreement. As of December 31, 2020, noamounts were\ndrawn and the Company had $ 44million of issued letters of credit outstanding from the revolving credit and\nguaranty agreement.\n11. Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn June 2020, the Company entered into a Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock purchase agreement\npursuant to which it issued a total of 8,321,395shares of Series H redeemable convertible preferred stock at $\n45.9062per share for gross proceeds of $ 382million. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material.\nThe Company previously issued Series A-1, Series A, Series B, Series C, Series D, Series E, Series F, and Series G\nprior to 2020. Immediately prior to the completion of the IPO on December 9, 2020, all outstanding shares of the\nCompany’s redeemable convertible preferred stock converted into an aggregate of 239,269,631shares of Class A common\nstock.\nThe following table summarizes the redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding immediately prior to the\nconversion into common stock, and the rights and preferences of the Company’s respective series preceding the\nCompany’s IPO in December 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share\ndata):\nShares                                Per Share        Aggregate\nShares    Issued and          Issuance             Conversion       Liquidati…       Carrying\nSeries        Authorized    Outstandi…             Price                  Price       Preference          Value\nSeries A-1        13,330        13,330    $         0.15          $        0.15    $           2    $         7\nSeries A          27,159        27,159              0.73                   0.73               20             20\nSeries B           7,925         7,925              5.68                   5.48               45             45\nSeries C          26,839        26,839              4.79                   4.79              128            128\nSeries D          98,008        98,008              5.51    -1             5.51              540            535\nSeries E          18,055        18,055             13.85                  13.85              250            250\nSeries F          18,186        18,186             22.48                  22.48              409            476\nSeries G          21,165        21,165             37.94                  37.94              803            803\nSeries H           9,351         8,316             45.91                  45.91              382            382\nTotal            240,018       238,983                                             $       2,579    $     2,646\n(1) The issuance price for Series D redeemable convertible preferred stock was $ 5.50688, except for shares issued\nvia the conversion of certain of the outstanding convertible promissory notes issued in 2017, for which the\nconversion price was $ 4.78778per share.\nForward Contract In Connection with Issuance of Series F Redeemable Convertible Preferred Stock\nIn February 2019, the Company issued a total of 13,736,615shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock\nat $ 22.4751per share for gross proceeds of $ 309million. To accommodate the timing of regulatory approvals\nrequired by an existing investor (who did not participate in the initial issuance of Series F redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock), the Company committed to sell 4,449,370shares of Series F redeemable convertible\npreferred stock at $ 22.4751per share for gross proceeds of $ 100million to this investor in a subsequent closing,\nwhich ultimately occurred in May 2019. The preferred stock issuance costs were not material. At the date of the\ninitial closing, the Company determined that the\n123\nTable o f Contents\ncommitment to defer the sale of shares of Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock to this investor\nrepresented a freestanding instrument that should be classified as a liability and measured at fair value on a\nrecurring basis, with changes in fair value recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements of\noperations. The initial measurement of the liability at its fair value of $ 1million was recorded with a\ncorresponding reduction recognized in additional paid-in capital as a deemed dividend distributed to the investor.\nImmediately prior to the subsequent closing in May 2019, the fair value of the liability was determined to be $\n68million, resulting in an expense of $ 67million recorded to other (expense) income, net in the consolidated\nstatements of operations which was attributable to the increase in the fair value of Series F redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock. Upon the subsequent closing, the carrying amount of the liability was reclassified to\nmezzanine equity.\nThe fair value of the liability (valued as a forward contract) at issuance and as of subsequent closing was\ndetermined with the following assumptions:\nAs of                 As of\nFebruary 22,               May 14,\n2019                  2019\nCurrent forward price per share             $         22.48          $      37.76\nContractual forward price per share         $         22.48          $      22.48\nRisk-free rate                                         2.46     %            2.41  %\nExpected years until subsequent closing                      0.23               —\nPresent value of contractual forward        $         22.35          $      22.48\nprice per share\nValue of the forward contract per share     $          0.13          $      15.28\nNumber of preferred shares issued in the          4,449,370             4,449,370\nsubsequent closing\nFair value of forward contract              $             1          $         68\nliability(in millions)\nAs of December 31, 2020, there was nopreferred stock issued and outstanding.\n12. Common Stock\nCommon Stock Reserved for Future Issuance\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s shares of common stock reserved for future issuance on an as-converted\nbasis (in thousands):\nDecember 31,    December 31,\n2019            2020\nConversion of outstanding redeemable             230,953               —\nconvertible preferred stock\nStock options issued and outstanding              36,247          33,802\nunder the 2014 Plan\nRSUs outstanding under the 2014 and 2020          15,924          34,939\nPlan\nRemaining shares available for future             10,478          32,210\nissuance\nShares available for issuance under the                —           6,499\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nTotal                                            293,602         107,450\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended, or the 2014 Plan, which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted for\na term of up to ten years(or five yearsif the option was an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10%\nstockholder) and at prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as\ndetermined by the Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock\noption granted to a greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the\nshares on the date of grant. Options granted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based\n124\nTable o f Contents\nawards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of shares of common stock available\nfor issuance.\nIn connection with the IPO, the 2014 Plan was terminated effective immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased granting any additional awards under the 2014 Plan.\nAll outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to the\nterms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options that expire or terminate or are forfeited or\nrepurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically transferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement. The 2020 Plan\nprovides for the granting of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights,\nperformance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the Company's employees,\ndirectors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are forfeited, canceled, or\nrepurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance under the\n2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved for issuance under the\n2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on January 1, 2021 in an amount\nequal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total number of all classes of common\nstock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each automatic increase, or (iii) such other\nnumber of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to the applicable January 1.\nThe exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of\nour Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten years(or five\nyearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at prices no less\nthan 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the exercise price\nof an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110% of the estimated\nfair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest over four years.\nRSUs\nPrior to November 2020 , the Company granted RSUs that vest only upon the satisfaction of both service-based and\nliquidity event-related performance vesting conditions. The service-based vesting condition for these awards\ngenerally is satisfied over four years. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition was satisfied\nupon the effectiveness of the IPO Registration Statement. The liquidity event-related performance vesting condition\nwas achieved upon the effectiveness of the Company’s IPO, resulting in the Company recording cumulative stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 279million for those RSUs for which the service-based vesting condition has been\nsatisfied. Stock-based compensation related to the remaining service-based period after the liquidity event-related\nperformance vesting condition was satisfied will be recorded over the remaining requisite service period. Since\nNovember 2020, with the exception of the CEO Performance Award discussed below, the Company granted RSUs that vest\nonly upon the satisfaction of a service-based vesting condition which is generally four years.\nCEO Performance Award\nIn November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the CEO (the “CEO\nPerformance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service condition and achievement\nof certain stock price goals. The CEO Performance Award is excluded from Class A common stock issued and\noutstanding until the satisfaction of these vesting conditions. The CEO Performance Award also provides the holder\nwith certain stockholder rights, such as the right to vote the shares with the other holders of Class A common\nstock and a right to cumulative declared dividends. However, the CEO Performance Award is not considered a\nparticipating security for purposes of calculating net loss per share attributable to common stockholders as the\nright to the cumulative declared dividends is forfeitable if the service condition is not met.\nThe CEO Performance Award is eligible to vest beginning on the first trading day 18months following the day\nCompany’s IPO date, and expiring seven yearsafter the IPO date. The CEO Performance Award comprises ninetranches\nthat are eligible to vest based on the achievement of stock price goals, ranging from $ 187.60to $ 501.00per share,\neach of which are referred to as a Company Stock Price Target, measured over a consecutive 180-day trading period\nduring the performance period as set forth below. This measurement period was designed to reward the CEO only if\nthe Company achieved sustained growth in the stock price.\n125\nTable o f Contents\nCompany Stock      Number of RSUs\nPrice Target    Eligible to Vest\n1          $187.60             518,950\n2          $226.80             518,950\n3          $265.80           1,037,900\n4          $305.00           1,037,900\n5          $344.00           1,037,900\n6          $383.00           1,556,850\n7          $422.20           1,556,850\n8          $461.20           1,556,850\n9          $501.00           1,556,850\nThe Company calculated the grant date fair value of the CEO Performance Award based on multiple stock price paths\ndeveloped through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. A Monte Carlo simulation model also calculates a\nderived service period for each of the ninevesting tranches, which is the measure of the expected time to achieve\neach Company Stock Price Target. A Monte Carlo simulation model requires the use of various assumptions, including\nthe underlying stock price, volatility, and the risk-free interest rate as of the valuation date, corresponding to\nthe length of time remaining in the performance period, and expected dividend yield. The weighted-average grant\ndate fair value of the CEO Performance Award was $ 39.8275per share. The Company will recognize total stock-based\ncompensation expense of $ 413million over the derived service period of each tranche, which is between 2.53to\n4.42years, using the accelerated attribution method as long as the CEO satisfies the service-based vesting\ncondition. If the Company Stock Price Targets are met sooner than the derived service period, the Company will\nadjust its stock-based compensation to reflect the cumulative expense associated with the vested awards. Provided\nthat Tony Xu continues to be the Company's CEO, the Company will recognize stock-based compensation expense over\nthe requisite service period, regardless of whether the Company Stock Price Targets are achieved.\nThe Company recorded $ 12million of stock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award during\nthe year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to\nthe CEO Performance Award was $ 401million.\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of activity under the 2014 and 2020 Plan and related information was as follows (in millions, except\nshare amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                    Average\nShares       Weighted-    Remaining\nShares             subject to         Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nAvailable                Options        Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nfor Grant            Outstanding           Price    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December       10,478                 36,247    $       2.38                 6.92    $      1,070\n31, 2019\nShares authorized            40,493                      —\nOptions granted                   —                      —    $          —\nOptions exercised                 —                 -2,191    $       1.90                                  129\nOptions forfeited               254                   -254    $       1.94\nRSUs granted                -20,126                      —\nRSUs forfeited                1,046                      —\nShares withheld\nrelated to net share             65\nsettlement, returned\nto the 2020 Plan\nBalance as of December       32,210                 33,802    $       2.42                 5.92    $      4,744\n31, 2020\nExercisable as of                                   28,291    $       1.95                 5.61    $      3,983\nDecember 31, 2020\nVested and expected to\nvest as of                                          33,802    $       2.42                 5.92    $      4,744\nDecember 31, 2020\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the estimated fair value of the Company’s common stock as of the respective period-end dates.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020\nwas $ 24million, $ 47million, and $ 129million, respectively.

The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average\nperiod of 2.91years.\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Employee Stock Purchase\nPlan (\"the ESPP\"), which became effective on the business day immediately prior to the effectiveness of the\nregistration statement on Form S-1 related to the IPO. A total of 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock were\ninitially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance\nunder the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the\nfiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any) occurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600shares of Class A\ncommon stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of the outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the\nlast day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\nThe ESPP includes two components: a component that allows the Company to make offerings intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code and a component that allows the Company to make offerings not intended to qualify under\nSection 423 of the Code to designated companies. Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows\neligible employees to contribute (in the form of payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the\nadministrator) an amount established by the administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A\ncommon stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of December 31, 2020, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such period\nwill begin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n13. Tender Offer and Stock Repurchases\nIn September 2018, the Company was authorized to repurchase up to an aggregate of $ 100million in shares of\npreferred and common stock for $ 9.60per share for redeemable convertible preferred stock and $ 8.40per share for\ncommon stock from certain holders. The tender offer transaction was completed in October 2018 and an aggregate of\n189,685shares of Series A redeemable convertible preferred stock, 107,600shares of Series A-1 redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock, and 7,014,335shares of common stock were repurchased by the Company for a total\nconsideration of $ 62million.\nThe purchase price in excess of the carrying value of repurchased Series A and A-1 redeemable convertible preferred\nstock of $ 3million was recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital, while the carrying value of the\nshares repurchased was recorded as a reduction of redeemable convertible preferred stock. The redeemable\nconvertible preferred stock repurchased was retired immediately thereafter. For common stock repurchased from\nemployees, the excess of the purchase price paid by the Company over the fair value of the common stock totaled $\n9million and was recorded as stock-based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2018. The common\nstock was retired immediately upon repurchase.\nAdditionally, in 2018, the Company repurchased 193,775shares of common stock from twoemployees as part of the\nseparation arrangement at a price in excess of the fair value on the date of repurchase. Stock-based compensation\nexpense as a result of the repurchase was not material during the year ended December 31, 2018.

Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax\nassets is assessed periodically based on the ASC 740 more-likely-than-not realization threshold criterion. This\nassessment\n129\nTable o f Contents\nconsiders matters such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable\nincome, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. The evaluation of the recoverability of the\ndeferred tax assets requires that the Company weigh all positive and negative evidence to reach a conclusion that\nit is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The weight\ngiven to the evidence is commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified. Due to the lack of\nU.S. earnings history, the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation\nallowance. Overall, the valuation allowance increased by $ 154million and $ 97million in the years ended December\n31, 2019 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the Company had accumulated federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n689million and $ 547million, respectively. Of the $ 689million of federal net operating losses, $ 629million is\ncarried forward indefinitely but is limited to 80% of taxable income. The remaining federal and state net operating\nloss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2033 and 2023, respectively.\nThe Company also had $ 19million of federal and $ 12million of California research and development tax credit\ncarryforwards as of December 31, 2020. The federal research and development tax credits expire in varying amounts\nstarting in 2033. The California research credits do not expire and may be carried forward indefinitely.\nThe Company’s ability to utilize the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future may be subject\nto substantial restrictions in the event of past or future ownership changes as defined in Section 382 of the\nInternal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and similar state tax law. The most recent analysis of the Company’s\nhistorical ownership changes was completed through December 31, 2019. Based on the analysis, the Company does not\nanticipate a current limitation on the tax attributes.\nOn March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) was enacted in response to\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act permits employers to defer the payment of the employer share of social\nsecurity taxes due for the period beginning March 27, 2020 and ending December 31, 2020. The Company deferred the\nemployer share of social security taxes from April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. Of the amounts deferred, 50%\nare required to be paid by December 31, 2021 and the remaining 50% are required to be paid by December 31, 2022.\nThe Company completed its evaluation of the impact of the CARES Act, and with the exception of the expected impact\nfrom the payroll tax deferral, does not expect the provisions of the legislation to have a significant impact on\nthe effective tax rate, deferred tax assets and liabilities, or income tax payable of the Company.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits as of both December 31, 2019 and 2020 was $ 7million of tax\nbenefits, that, if recognized, would result in adjustments to the valuation allowance.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits is included in the table\nbelow (in millions):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019       2020\nUnrecognized tax benefits at beginning      $                        1    $     3    $     7\nof year\nIncreases related to current year tax                                2          4          3\npositions\nDecreases related to prior year tax                                  —          —         -3\npositions\nUnrecognized tax benefits at end of year    $                        3    $     7    $     7\nThe Company’s policy is to recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within\nprovision for income taxes. The Company did not accrue any interest expense or penalties during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2018, 2019, and 2020.\nThe Company files U.S. federal and state income tax returns in the United States federal jurisdiction as well as\nforeign jurisdictions. The Company’s income tax returns generally remain subject to examination by United States\nfederal and state and foreign tax authorities.\n15. Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock\nand participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common\nstock and Class B\n130\nTable o f Contents\ncommon stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common\nstock share equally in the Company’s net losses. Before the IPO, the Company’s outstanding securities also included\nconvertible preferred stock. The holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock did not have a contractual\nobligation to share in the Company’s losses, and as a result, net losses were not allocated to these securities.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders during the periods presented. The shares issued in the IPO and the shares of Class A common stock\nissued upon conversion of the outstanding shares of redeemable convertible preferred stock in the IPO, as well as\nvested RSUs that have not been settled are included in the table below weighted for the period outstanding in the\nyear ended December 31, 2020 (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share\ndata):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018         2019          2020\nCommon       Common       Class A       Class B\nNet loss                                    $                     -204    $    -667    $     -446    $      -15\nLess: Premium paid on repurchase of                                 -3            —             —             —\nredeemable convertible preferred stock\nLess: Deemed dividend to preferred                                   —           -1             —             —\nstockholders\nNet loss attributable to common             $                     -207    $    -668    $     -446    $      -15\nstockholders\nWeighted-average number of shares\noutstanding used to compute net loss per                        44,305       43,252        60,422         1,968\nshare attributable to common\nstockholders, basic and diluted\nNet loss per share attributable to          $                    -4.67    $  -15.44    $    -7.39    $    -7.39\ncommon stockholders, basic and diluted\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect (in thousands):\nYear Ended December 31,\n2018       2019      2020\nRedeemable convertible preferred stock                    191,602    230,953         —\n(on an as-converted basis)\nStock options to purchase common stock                     39,191     36,247    33,802\nUnvested restricted stock units(1)                          6,065     15,924    17,987\nCommon stock subject to repurchase                             25          —         —\nConvertible promissory notes                                    —          —     2,595\nTotal                                                     236,883    283,124    54,384\n(1) The CEO Performance Award is excluded from the above table because the Company Stock Price Target had not been\nmet as of December 31, 2020.\n16. 401(k) Plan\nThe Company has a 401(k) Plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401 of the Internal\nRevenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, eligible and participating employees may defer a portion of their pretax\nearnings not to exceed the maximum amount allowable. The Company does not make contributions for eligible\nemployees.\n17.

Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial\nofficer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable\nassurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Annual Report on Form 10-K does not include a report of management's assessment regarding internal control over\nfinancial reporting or an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm due to a\ntransition period established by the rules of the SEC for newly public companies.\nChanges in Internal Control\nOther than as described below, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in\nmanagement’s evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(d) or 15d-15(d) of the Exchange Act during the quarter ended\nDecember 31, 2020 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting. As described below, we have implemented changes to our internal control over financial\nreporting to remediate the material weakness identified below.\nRemediation Efforts on Previously Identified Material Weakness\nIn connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31,\n2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our\ninternal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,\nin internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material\nmisstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The\nmaterial weakness identified occurred because (i) we had inadequate processes and controls to ensure an appropriate\nlevel of precision related to our revenue to cash reconciliation process, and (ii) we did not have sufficient\nresources with the adequate technical skills to meet the emerging needs of our financial reporting requirements.\nIn response to this material weakness, we (i) hired additional accounting, engineering, and business intelligence\npersonnel and implemented process level and management review controls to identify and address emerging risks and\nenhance communication between our product, engineering, sales, business intelligence and accounting teams, and (ii)\nimplemented enhancements to our revenue to cash and reconciliation process to increase the level of precision\nrelated to such processes.\nWe believe our remediation efforts resulted in the elimination of the previously identified material weakness as of\nDecember 31, 2020. While this material weakness has been remediated, we cannot assure you that we have identified\nall of our existing material weaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses. We\nhave dedicated resources to the design, implementation, documentation and testing of our internal control over\nfinancial reporting. We will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting and will continue to make changes that we believe will strengthen our internal control over financial\nreporting to ensure that our financial statements continue to be fairly stated in all material respects.\nNeither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm has performed an evaluation of our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting during any period in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In\nlight of the material weakness that was previously identified as a result of the limited procedures performed, we\nbelieve that it is possible that, had we and our independent registered public accounting firm performed an\nevaluation of our internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley\nAct, additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies may have been identified.\n132\nTable o f Contents\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
