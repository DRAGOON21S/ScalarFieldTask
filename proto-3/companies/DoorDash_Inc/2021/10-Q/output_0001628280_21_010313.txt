This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities
laws, which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to
future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking
statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,”
“would,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “predict,” “potential” or “continue”
or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans
or intentions. Forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q include, but are not
limited to, statements about:

• our future financial performance, including our expectations regarding our revenue, cost of revenue, operating
expenses, Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit,
Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, our ability to determine reserves, and our
ability to maintain and increase long-term future profitability;

• our ability to successfully execute our business and growth strategy;

• the sufficiency of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to meet our liquidity needs;

• the demand for our platform or for local logistics platforms in general;

• our ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers and Dashers;

• our ability to effectively manage costs related to Dashers;

• our ability to develop new offerings, services and features, and bring them to market in a timely manner and make
enhancements to our platform;

• our ability to compete with existing and new competitors in existing and new markets and offerings;

• our expectations regarding outstanding litigation and legal and regulatory matters;

• our expectations regarding the effects of existing and developing laws and regulations, including with respect to
independent contractor classification, pricing and commissions, taxation and privacy and data protection;

• our ability to manage and insure auto-related and operations-related risk associated with our business;

• our expectations regarding new and evolving markets;

• our ability to develop and protect our brand;

• our ability to maintain the security and availability of our platform;

• our expectations and management of future growth;

• our expectations concerning relationships with third parties;

• our ability to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property;

• our ability to integrate companies and assets that we acquire;

• the increased expenses associated with being a public company; and

• the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, on global capital and financial markets,
general economic conditions in the United States, and our business and operations.

We caution you that the foregoing list may not contain all of the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q.

You should not rely upon forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. We have based the forward-
looking statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q primarily on our current expectations and
projections about future events and trends that we believe may affect our business, financial condition, results of
operations, and prospects. The outcome of the events described in these forward-looking statements is subject to
risks, uncertainties, and other factors, including those described in the section titled “Risk Factors” and
elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing
environment. New risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time and it is not possible for us to predict all
risks and uncertainties that could have an impact on the forward-looking statements contained in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q. We cannot assure you that the results, events, and circumstances reflected in the forward-
looking statements will be achieved or occur, and actual results, events, or circumstances could differ materially
from those described in the forward-looking statements.

Neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of any of these forward-
looking statements. Moreover, the forward-looking statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relate only
to events as of the date on which the statements are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking
statements made in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q or to reflect new information or the occurrence of unanticipated events, except as
required by law. We may not actually achieve the plans, intentions or expectations disclosed in our forward-looking
statements and you should not place undue reliance on our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking
statements do not reflect the potential impact of any future acquisitions, mergers, dispositions, joint ventures or
investments we may make.

In addition, statements that “we believe” and similar statements reflect our beliefs and opinions on the relevant
subject. These statements are based upon information available to us as of the date of this Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q, and while we believe such information forms a reasonable basis for such statements, such information may
be limited or incomplete, and our statements should not be read to indicate that we have conducted an exhaustive
inquiry into, or review of, all potentially available relevant information. These statements are inherently
uncertain and investors are cautioned not to unduly rely upon these statements.

DoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”), is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The
Company provides a local logistics platform that enables local brick-and-mortar businesses to address consumers’
expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.

The Company’s local logistics platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company operates the
DoorDash Marketplace, which enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting
them with consumers (the “Marketplace”). Merchants can fulfill this demand with independent contractors who use the
Company’s platform to deliver orders (“Dashers”). As part of the Marketplace, the Company also offers Pickup, which
allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees,
as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the Company’s platform with large group orders and
catering orders for businesses and events. The Marketplace also includes DashPass, the Company’s subscription
product, which provides consumers with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced
service fees. In addition to the Marketplace, the Company offers DoorDash Drive, or Drive, a white-label logistics
service that enables merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this
demand using the Company’s local logistics platform, and DoorDash Storefront, or Storefront, that enables merchants
to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers
on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.

certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and
expenses during the period presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances
for credit losses, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and website development
costs, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other financial instruments,
valuation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting,
insurance reserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these
estimates.

Disaggregated Revenue Information

All revenue recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 was related to the Company's core
business, which is primarily comprised of Marketplace and Drive.
Revenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of DashPass, the
address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):

Contract Liabilities
The timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The
Company’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the
condensed consolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from
consumers and merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized
over time. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2021 was as
follows (in millions):
                                                                      
                                                Contract Liabilities  
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── 
  Beginning balance                          $                   108  
  Addition to contract liabilities                               260  
  Reduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                       -245  
  Ending balance                             $                   123  
                                                                      
(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Company's online Marketplace. When they are
redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the carrying amount of the gift cards and
consumer credits and the amount due to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount
recognized as revenue related to the reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount
presented in the table above. Net revenues associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked
by the Company as it is impracticable to do so.
(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 22million associated with unearned prepayments
received by the Company, all of which was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31, 2021.
Deferred Contract Costs
Deferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s
contracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to
recover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which
the Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are
recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance
sheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing
expense and amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of
revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. A
summary of activities related to deferred contract costs was as follows (in millions):

2020 Convertible Promissory Notes

In February 2020, the Company issued convertible notes for an aggregate principal amount of $ 340million with an
initial maturity date in March 2025 (the “2020 Notes”). The Company received net proceeds of $ 333million, net of $
2million in debt issuance costs, reflecting an original issue discount on the principal of $ 5million. The interest
rate is 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears.

In February 2021, the Company repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the 2020 Notes in full for $
375million.
                                                                                                                   
  8. Commitments and Contingencies                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
Legal Proceedings

From time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.
Although the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes
that the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the
outcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,
diversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or
not a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring
recognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential
disclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.

The Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,
and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex
Operations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”) . The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that
was signed into law in September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard
regarding contractor classification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an
adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased
legal proceedings and related expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business
model and operations. Further, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar
to the test set forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification.

The Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries
conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the
classification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, and other matters. For example, we are
currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of California for payroll tax liabilities.

In October 2019, the Company made an offer, and in November 2019 it filed a settlement agreement, of $ 40million
with the representatives of Dashers that had filed actions in the States of California and Massachusetts in order
to settle claims under the Private Attorney General Act and class action claims alleging worker misclassification
of Dashers against the Company. These actions were filed by and on behalf of Massachusetts Dashers that utilized
the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since August
2016. On June 8, 2020, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be
paid by the Company from
                                                        16

$ 40million to $ 41million. In October 2020, the Company entered into an amended settlement agreement to increase
the total amount to be paid by the Company from $ 41million to $ 89million. In April 2021, the Company entered into
an amended settlement agreement increasing the total amount to be paid by the Company to $ 100million.

In March 2020, the Company reached an agreement to resolve worker misclassification claims associated with certain
Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the Company. Under the
agreement, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers are eligible for settlement payments, subject to a
threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements. The Company anticipated
that the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these individual settlement
agreements, including attorneys’ fees, would be approximately $ 70million. In July 2020, the Company transferred $
69million into an escrow account, the settlement amount to be released and paid to claimants and claimants’
attorneys if a minimum number of claimants agreed to release their claims against the Company by the date specified
within the settlement agreement. In December 2020, the number of claimants who agreed to release their claims
against the Company exceeded the minimum, and the Company committed to release the settlement amount in the escrow
account to claimants and claimants' attorneys. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, $ 67million out of the $
69million in the escrow account was distributed to the claimants and claimants' attorneys. As of March 31, 2021,
the remaining settlement amount was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed
consolidated balance sheets.

In July and August 2020, the Company reached additional agreements to resolve worker misclassification claims
associated with certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with the
Company. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers are eligible for settlement
payments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into individual settlement agreements.
The Company anticipates that the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under these
individual settlement agreements, including attorneys’ fees, will be approximately $ 15million, of which $ 6million
was paid in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

In June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of
San Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees
in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This
action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the Company from continuing
to classify Dashers as independent contractors. In August 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed a motion
for preliminary injunction that would bar the Company from continuing to classify Dashers in California as
independent contractors during the pendency of this case. In December 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney
withdrew its request for preliminary injunction. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred;
however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.

Indemnification

The Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these
arrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses
suffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other
intellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these
indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum
potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not
determinable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been
made. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification
agreements.

The Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may
require the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their
status or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the
individual.

Noliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021.

Bank Commitments and Letters of Credit

In November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provides for a $
300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. Loans under the credit facility bear
interest, at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of
the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a
one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is
also obligated to
                                                        17                                                         
Table of Contents
pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront
fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such as
financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as customary negative
covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional
indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions, merge or
consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and acquisitions,
and engage in transactions with affiliates.

In August 2020, the Company amended and restated its existing revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide
for $ 100million of incremental revolving loan commitments, effective upon the consummation of an initial public
offering of the Company’s common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021, for total revolving commitments of $
400million. The amendment and restatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from
November 19, 2024 to August 7, 2025.

As of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit
agreement. As of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, noamounts were drawn and the Company had $ 44million and $
36million of issued letters of credit outstanding from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.

Sales and Indirect Tax Matters

The Company is under audit by various state and local tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect tax
matters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves when they become probable and the amount can be
reasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the
condensed consolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly
uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may
differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will
receive additional assessments by various tax authorities in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments could
result in changes to the Company's reserves related to positions on sales and indirect tax filings. In the three
months ended March 31, 2021, the Company favorably resolved a sales and indirect tax exposure resulting in a $
29million reduction of liabilities previously reserved.

2014 Equity Incentive Plan

In March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended, or the 2014 Plan, which provided for the
granting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014
Plan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted at
prices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as determined by the
Company’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a
greater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of
grant. Options granted generally vest over four years.

The 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon
early exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to
repurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated
for any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option
vesting schedule. Stock-based awards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of
shares of common stock available for issuance.

In connection with the Company's initial public offering (the "IPO"), the 2014 Plan was terminated effective
immediately prior to the effectiveness of the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan ("2020 Plan") and the Company ceased
granting any additional awards under the 2014 Plan. All outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the
termination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to the terms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options
that expire or terminate or are forfeited or repurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically
transferred to the 2020 Plan.

2020 Equity Incentive Plan

In November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,
which became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the IPO Registration Statement. The 2020 Plan
provides for the granting of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs"), stock
                                                        18                                                         
Table of Contents
appreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common stock to the
Company's employees, directors, and consultants. Stock-based awards under the 2020 Plan that expire or are
forfeited, canceled, or repurchased generally are returned to the pool of shares of Class A common stock available
for issuance under the 2020 Plan. In addition, the number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock reserved
for issuance under the 2020 Plan will automatically increase on January 1 of each calendar year, starting on
January 1, 2021 in an amount equal to the least of (i) 32,493,000shares, (ii) five percent ( 5%) of the total
number of all classes of common stock outstanding on December 31 of the fiscal year before the date of each
automatic increase, or (iii) such other number of shares determined by the Company's board of directors prior to
the applicable January 1.

The exercise price of the options granted under the 2020 Plan will at least be equal to the fair market value of
the Company's Class A common stock on the date of grant. The options may be granted for a term of up to ten
years(or five yearsif the option is an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder) and at
prices no less than 100% of the fair market value of the shares on the date of grant, provided, however, that the
exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a greater than 10% stockholder shall not be less than 110%
of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant. Options granted under the 2020 Plan generally vest
over four years.

As of March 31, 2021, there was $ 16million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested
stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.14years.

In November 2020, the Company’s board of directors approved the grant of 10,379,000RSUs to the Company's Chief
Executive Officer (the “CEO Performance Award”). The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service
condition and achievement of certain stock price goals. As of March 31, 2021, unrecognized stock-based compensation
expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 374million, which is expected to be recognized over a period of
4.07years.

As of March 31, 2021, there was $ 831million of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested
RSUs, excluding the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the CEO Performance Award granted
in November 2020. The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average period of
2.78years.

2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan

In November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020
Employee Stock Purchase Plan ("the ESPP"), which became effective on the business day immediately prior to the
effectiveness of the registration statement on Form S-1 related to the IPO. A total of 6,498,600shares of Class A
common stock were initially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of shares of Class A common stock
available for issuance under the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the
fiscal year following the fiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any) occurs equal to the least of (i)
6,498,600shares of Class A common stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of the outstanding shares of all
classes of common stock on the last day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) an amount determined by
the administrator of the ESPP.

Subject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute (in the form of
payroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the administrator) an amount established by the
administrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A common stock at a discounted price per share.
As of March 31, 2021, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such period will
begin unless and until determined by the administrator.
                                                                                                                   
  10. Income Taxes                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
The Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate,
adjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate
of the annual effective tax rate and, if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a
cumulative adjustment in such period.

The Company recorded $ 1million of provision for income taxes for both the three months ended March 31, 2020 and
2021. The provision for income taxes for both periods presented were primarily attributable to state franchise
taxes and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions.

The Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance
if it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. The
Company evaluates and weighs all available evidence, both positive and negative, including its historic operating
results, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, as well as projected future taxable income. The
Company will continue to regularly assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Changes in earnings
performance and future earnings projections, among other
                                                        20

factors, may cause the Company to adjust the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could materially
impact the income tax expense in the period the Company determines that these factors have changed. As of March 31,
2021, the Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance on its deferred tax assets except in certain
foreign jurisdictions.

As of March 31, 2021, the Company had $ 15million of unrecognized tax benefits, which, if recognized, would result
in adjustments to the valuation allowance. The Company is subject to income tax audits in the U.S. and foreign
jurisdictions. The Company recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and believes that the Company
has provided adequate reserves for income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. Due to the Company’s history of
tax losses, all years remain open to tax audits.
11. Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders
The Company computes net loss per share using the two-class method required for multiple classes of common stock
and participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common
stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and
Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net losses. Before the IPO, the Company’s outstanding
securities also included convertible preferred stock. The holders of redeemable convertible preferred stock did not
have a contractual obligation to share in the Company’s losses, and as a result, net losses were not allocated to
these securities.
The following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common
stockholders during the periods presented. RSUs that vested upon the IPO but have not been settled are included in
the denominator in calculating net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2021 (in millions, except
share amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):

The following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted

the respective periods (in thousands):

We have built a technology-enabled local logistics platform that enables local brick-and-mortar businesses to
address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.

We built our products to serve the needs of these three key constituencies. We do this primarily through our
Marketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges such
as customer acquisition, delivery, insights and analytics, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support.
Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach. It generates significant
demand for merchants by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand through
delivery, facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers.

In addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our business today, we offer merchants a
variety of products, which we refer to as merchant services, to facilitate sales that merchants have originated
through their own channels. Drive, our white-label logistics service, enables merchants that have generated
consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our local logistics platform. Storefront
enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to
offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities.

In addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key

Total Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed on the DoorDash platform, including those completed
through our Marketplace, Drive offering, and Storefront, over the period of measurement. Total Orders have
increased over time as we have added new consumers, increased retention and engagement of existing consumers,
including through the launch of DashPass, expanded into new markets, and increased the number of orders completed
through Drive.

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Total Orders increased to 329 million, or 219% growth compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase in Total Orders was driven by increased retention and engagement of
existing consumers, the addition of new consumers, and an increase in the number of orders completed through Drive.
These trends accelerated in part due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which resulted in in-store dining
shutdowns and the adoption of shelter-in-place measures. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our
business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a widespread
rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect the growth rate of Total Orders to decline in future periods.

As we continue to increase consumer adoption and make using DoorDash a regular activity, we expect Total Orders to
continue to grow.

Marketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of Marketplace orders completed on our local
logistics platform, including taxes, tips, and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to
DashPass. Marketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does
not include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through
Drive and Storefront because we utilize a per-order fee structure for such orders and typically do not receive
information regarding
                                                        22

the dollar value of such orders. Marketplace GOV is primarily driven by the volume and dollar value of orders
completed on our local logistics platform.

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Marketplace GOV increased to $9.9 billion, or 222% growth compared to the
three months ended March 31, 2020, based on the growth in Total Orders as well as the increased value of
Marketplace orders in part as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth
of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following the
widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect the growth rate in Marketplace GOV to decline in future
periods.

We expect that Marketplace GOV will continue to grow as Total Orders grow, though at a slower rate, as Marketplace
GOV does not include Drive while Total Orders do include Drive. We further expect that Marketplace GOV will grow at
a slower rate than Total Orders as we continue to broaden our selection of merchants at lower price points to
increase affordability for consumers. We are purposefully increasing the affordability of the selection of goods
offered by merchants on our platform to improve consumer engagement over time.

Contribution Profit (Loss). We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and
marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based
compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,
and (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Gross profit (loss) is
defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and
amortization related to cost of revenue. We define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a
percentage of revenue for the same period.

We use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution
Profit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into
account the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Contribution Profit improved to $209 million, compared to $25 million in
the three months ended March 31, 2020, driven by the growth in Marketplace GOV, increased merchant commissions and
fees from our Marketplace and Drive, cost structure improvements, and increased operating leverage as a result of
scale in our business. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Contribution Margin increased to 19%, compared to
7% in the three months ended March 31, 2020, driven by cost structure improvements and increased operating leverage
as a result of scale in our business.

Our Contribution Profit (Loss) can vary significantly as we invest in enhancing the scale of our local logistics
platform, including through investments in sales and marketing and promotions spend, launching new products, and
launching in new geographies. We expect Contribution Profit (Loss) and Contribution Margin to fluctuate in the near
term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business and to improve over the long term as we achieve greater
scale, increase adoption, and drive efficiency through operational improvements.

Contribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It
does not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain
expenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution
Profit (Loss) is not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance.
Further, it is not a financial measure of profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for the
profitability of our business nor does it imply profitability.

Adjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and
regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) a one-time non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract
related to the issuance of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, (iii) loss on disposal of property
and equipment, (iv) acquisition-related costs, (v) impairment expenses, (vi) provision for income taxes, (vii)
interest income and expense, (viii) foreign exchange gain (loss), (ix) stock-based compensation expense and certain
payroll tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that
we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is
calculated by dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period.

In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Adjusted EBITDA improved to $43 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of
negative $70 million in the three months ended March 31, 2020. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, Adjusted
EBITDA Margin increased to 4%, compared to negative 19% in the three months ended March 31, 2020, driven by cost
structure improvements and increased operating leverage as a result of scale in our business.

We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace and the related
commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are
based on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our local
logistics platform to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our local logistics
platform to arrange for delivery services. We recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an
agent for both partner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects commissions charged to partner
merchants and fees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which
includes certain discounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer.
Revenue from our Marketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s
products.

We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of our
Marketplace revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass subscriptions is recognized on a ratable basis over the
contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of subscription purchased by the
consumer.

In addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Drive offering. We generate revenue from
Drive by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local logistics platform to arrange for delivery
services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in
time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.

Cost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization

Cost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of
rebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, insurance expenses, and costs
related to placing orders with non-partner merchants, (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding
merchants and Dashers, costs for providing support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform
infrastructure costs, and (iii) personnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to
our local operations, support, and other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses
primarily include salary, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined
based on an allocation of shared costs, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information
technology costs, among all departments based on employee headcount.

We expect that the cost of revenue will increase on an absolute dollar basis as our business grows and as we
continue to invest in order management and our platform and hire additional employees for our local operations,
support, and other teams to support the growth in our business. As a result, we expect that cost of revenue as a
percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long term as we
achieve greater scale and operational efficiency.
                                                                                                                   
  Sales and Marketing                                                                                              
                                                                                                                   
Sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,
consumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the
referrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing
expenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense
including amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.

We expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we invest to grow our
network of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and enhance our brand awareness. We expect sales and marketing
expenses as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long
term.

Research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data
analytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to our platform, as well as expenses
associated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.

We plan to continue to hire employees to support our research and development efforts to expand the capabilities
and scope of our platform and offerings. As a result, we expect that research and development expenses will
increase on an absolute dollar basis as we continue to invest to support these activities. We expect that research
and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and
decrease over the long term.

General and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include
litigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to
administrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated
with fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, acquisition-related expenses, bad debt
expense, and allocated overhead.

We expect that general and administrative expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis due to increases in
chargebacks associated with fraudulent credit card transactions and legal, tax, and regulatory expenses as we add
personnel and enhance our systems, processes, and controls to support the growth in our business as well as our
increased compliance and reporting requirements as a public company. We expect general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of revenue will vary from period to period over the short term and decrease over the long term.

Depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with
our property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation includes expenses associated with equipment for
merchants, including equipment for merchants under finance leases, computer equipment and software, office
equipment, and leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized software and
website development costs, as well as acquired intangible assets.

We expect that depreciation and amortization expenses will increase on an absolute dollar basis as we invest in
property and equipment to support the growth in our business. We expect depreciation and amortization expenses as a
percentage of revenue over the short term will vary from period to period and decrease over the long term.

Revenue increased by $715 million, or 198%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by a 219% increase in Total Orders to 329 million, which
led to a 222% increase in Marketplace GOV to $9.9 billion. The increase in Total Orders was primarily driven by
increased retention and engagement of existing consumers, the addition of new consumers, and an increase in the
number of orders completed through Drive. This increase was partially the result of the effects of the COVID-19
pandemic, which resulted in in-store dining shutdowns and shelter-in-place measures. For the three months ended
March 31, 2021, revenue increased at a slower rate than Marketplace GOV, primarily due to increased Dasher payout,
associated with both the implementation of the 2020 California ballot initiative Proposition 22, or Proposition 22,
and the period of Dasher undersupply in the quarter, as well as an increased proportion of orders coming from
consumers subscribed to DashPass, which has reduced fees for consumers.

Cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $369 million, or 190%, for the three
months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily
attributable to an increase of $235 million in order management costs, an increase of $104 million in platform
costs, both driven by significant growth in the number of Total Orders and Marketplace GOV, as well as an increase
of $16 million in personnel costs driven by increased headcount and an increase in stock-based compensation
expense.

As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 52% in the three
months ended March 31, 2021, decreasing from 53% in the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in cost of
revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, as a percentage of revenue was primarily driven by product and
operational improvements which improved the efficiency of our platform costs, as well as increased operating
leverage as a result of increasing scale in our business.

Sales and marketing expenses increased by $181 million, or 119%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $141 million
in merchant, consumer, and Dasher advertising and brand marketing expenses as we increased consumer adoption and
expanded our Dasher fleet, and an increase of $23 million in personnel-related compensation expenses and allocated
overhead driven by increased headcount and an increase in stock-based compensation expense.

As a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing expenses were 31% in the three months ended March 31, 2021,
decreasing from 42% in the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a
percentage of revenue was driven by increased operating leverage as existing consumers generated a greater
proportion of revenue.

Research and development expenses increased by $49 million, or 148%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $74 million
in personnel-related compensation expenses and allocated overhead due to increased headcount and an increase in
stock-based compensation expense, partially offset by an increase in capitalized software and website development
costs of $32 million.

As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were 8% in the three months ended March 31, 2021,
decreasing from 9% in the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses as a
percentage of revenue was driven by increased operating leverage as a result of increasing scale in our business.

General and administrative expenses increased by $87 million, or 106%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $57 million
in personnel-related compensation expenses, allocated overhead and stock-based compensation expense due to
increased headcount, an increase of $22 million in chargebacks associated with fraudulent credit card transactions,
an increase of $11 million in professional services fees to support growth in our business, and an increase of $11
million in bad debt expense, partially offset by a decrease of $29 million in sales and indirect tax liability as
we favorably resolved a sales and indirect tax exposure.

As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses were 15% in the three months ended March 31, 2021,
decreasing from 23% in the three months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in general and administrative expenses
as a percentage of revenue was driven by increased operating leverage as a result of increasing scale in our
business as well as a favorable resolution of a non-income tax exposure in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by $5 million, or 21%, for the three months ended March 31, 2021,
compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020. The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $6 million
in depreciation expenses related to equipment for merchants and an increase of $5 million in amortization expense
related to capitalized software and website development costs, offset by a decrease of $9 million in amortization
expenses related to intangible assets as the existing technology acquired from Caviar was fully amortized in the

Interest expense increased by $8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, compared to the three months
ended March 31, 2020. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the repayment and recognition
of debt discount and debt issuance costs on our Convertible Notes in the three months ended March 31, 2021.

We use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense,
adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit
(Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction with GAAP measures as
part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and
quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of
directors concerning our business and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures
provide useful information to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall
understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to
metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP
financial measures to assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of
management, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors
to use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our
industry.

Our definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.
In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain
limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed
consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense,
adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss),
Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin
should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance
with GAAP.

We compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and
marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,
                                                        29

financial measure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research

We define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-
based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and allocated overhead. We exclude stock-based
compensation as it is non-cash in nature and we exclude allocated overhead as it is generally a fixed cost and is
not directly impacted by Total Orders.

(1) We exclude certain costs and expenses from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense
because management believes that these costs and expenses are not indicative of our core operating performance, do
not reflect the underlying economics of our business, and are not necessary to operate our business. These excluded
costs and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii)
reserves for the collection of sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii)
expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification and price
controls, and (iv) donations as part of our COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts. We believe it is appropriate to
exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense because (1) the
timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting
process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not

We use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution
Profit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into
account the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders. We define Contribution Profit (Loss)
as our gross profit (loss) less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related
to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of
revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and
marketing expenses. We define gross margin as gross profit (loss) as a percentage of revenue for the same period
and we define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue for the same period.

less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and amortization related
to cost of revenue. Adjusted Gross Margin is defined as Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss) as a percentage of revenue for
the same period.

Adjusted EBITDA is a measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our
business. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and
regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) a one-time non-cash change in fair value of a forward contract
related to the issuance of our Series F redeemable convertible preferred stock, (iii) loss on disposal of property
and equipment, (iv) acquisition-related costs, (v) impairment expenses, (vi) provision for income taxes, (vii)
interest income and expense, (viii) foreign exchange gain (loss), (ix) stock-based compensation expense and certain
payroll tax expense, and (x) depreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by
dividing Adjusted EBITDA by revenue for the same period.

The following tables provide a reconciliation of net loss to Adjusted EBITDA and a calculation of net margin and
Adjusted EBITDA Margin:

(1) We exclude certain costs and expenses from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that
these costs and expenses are not indicative of our core operating performance, do not reflect the underlying
economics of our business, and are not necessary to operate our business. These excluded costs and expenses consist
of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii) reserves for the collection of
sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) expenses related to supporting
various policy matters, including those related to worker classification and price controls, and (iv) donations as
part of our COVID-19 pandemic relief efforts. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from
our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus
not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters,
management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as
a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22
and similar legislation.

On November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an
affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs &
Co. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, provides for a $ 300million unsecured revolving credit
facility maturing on August 7, 2025, increasing to $400 million in aggregate revolving commitments upon the
consummation of an initial public offering of our common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021. Loans under the
credit facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)
the higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted
LIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%.
We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of
credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of March 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the

$36 million of issued letters of credit outstanding from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.

On February 19, 2020, we issued $ 340million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to the
Convertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated February 19, 2020, among us, Caviar, and the investors party thereto, or
the Note Investors. We received net proceeds of $ 333million, net of $ 2million in debt issuance costs and an
original issue discount of $ 5million. The interest rate under the Convertible Notes was 10.00% per annum, payable
quarterly in arrears. In February 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible
Notes in full for $ 375million.

In December 2020, we completed our initial public offering (the "IPO") in which we received net proceeds of $3.3
billion from sales of shares of our Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions.

As of March 31, 2021, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of
$4.5 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 billion, and marketable securities of $467
million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors of $127 million represent cash due from our payment
processors for cleared transactions with merchants and consumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors
for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money
market funds. Marketable securities consisted of money market fund, commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S.
government agency securities, and U.S. Treasury securities.

We have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $1.7
billion as of March 31, 2021. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may
continue to incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result,
we may require additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable
securities, along with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will
be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months.

Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability
to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance
of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the
expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification
initiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,
services, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that
additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or
at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results
of operations could be adversely affected.

The following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:

Cash used in operating activities was $125 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020. This consisted of a
net loss of $129 million offset by non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $24 million, non-cash
reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $8 million, non-
cash stock-based compensation expense of $5 million, non-cash bad debt expense of $5 million, other non-cash
expenses of $5 million, and non-cash interest expense of $4 million related to the convertible notes. The net
changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily the result of an increase of $70 million in accounts
receivable, net, an increase of $60 million in funds held at payment processors, an increase of $6 million in
prepaid expenses and other current assets, an increase of $5 million in other assets, and a decrease of $6 million
for payments for operating lease liabilities, offset by an increase of $81 million in accrued expenses and other
current liabilities primarily related to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and indirect
taxes, accrued operations related expenses, and Dasher and merchant payable, an increase of $15 million in accounts
payable, and an increase of $4 million in other liabilities due to timing of legal settlements.

Cash provided by operating activities was $166 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021. This consisted of
a net loss of $110 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $97 million, non-cash

liabilities, and a decrease of $19 million in funds held at payment processors, offset by a decrease of $8 million
for payments for operating lease liabilities, an increase of $7 million in accounts receivable, net, and an
increase of $4 million in other assets. The increase in cash provided by operating activities for the three months
ended March 31, 2021 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020 was mainly due to the increases in non-cash
expenses and net changes in operating assets and liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $93 million, purchases of property and equipment of $22 million,
cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $10 million, offset by proceeds from the
sales and maturities of marketable securities of $130 million.

Cash used in investing activities was $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which primarily

Cash provided by financing activities was $334 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020, which primarily
consisted of $333 million of net proceeds from the issuance of convertible promissory notes.

Cash used in financing activities was $496 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which consisted of
$333 million of repayment of the convertible promissory notes, $166 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related
to net share settlement of equity awards, and $10 million of payment of deferred offering costs, offset by $13
million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.

We did not have during the periods presented, and we do not currently have, any off-balance sheet financing
arrangements or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, including entities
sometimes referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that were established for the purpose of
facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.

Our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial
statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements,
as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on
historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our
estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of
operations, and cash flows could be affected.

There have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.

We are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest
rates and foreign exchange risks.

Our investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade

separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our investment
policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We do not
enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.

Based on our investment portfolio balance as of March 31, 2021, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest
rates would not have materially affected our condensed consolidated financial statements. We currently do not hedge
these interest rate exposures.
                                                                                                                   
  Foreign Currency Exchange Risk                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
Transaction Exposure
We transact business in Canadian dollars and Australian dollars and have international revenue, as well as costs
denominated in Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign
currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income and loss from our
international businesses included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. A continued strengthening
of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included
in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.
Translation Exposure
We are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign
subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the
translation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into
U.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) which is part of stockholders’ equity (deficit).
                                                                                                                   
  Inflation Risk                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                   
We do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business, results of operations, or financial
condition.

Our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our

fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,
assurance that the

objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there
are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the
inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all
control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities
that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or
mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or
more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part
upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will
succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become
inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may
deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and not be detected.

We, including Caviar and our other subsidiaries, are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in,
legal proceedings, claims, regulatory inquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal
Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of business, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, Caviar delivery
providers, or other third parties (individually or as class actions).

The outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For
some matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses
is not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the
application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a
material loss in excess of the amount recorded.
                                                                                                                   
  Independent Contractor Classification Matters                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
We are regularly subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government
investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging
the classification of third-party delivery providers on our platform and on the Caviar platform as independent
contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that
would apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent
contractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create
uncertainty and unpredictability for us.

We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought
under the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act, or PAGA, and individual claims both in court as well
as arbitration and other matters challenging the classification of third-party delivery providers on our platform
and on the Caviar platform as independent contractors.

In November 2019, we filed an agreement to pay $40 million with the representatives of Dashers that had filed
certain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging
worker misclassification of Dashers, or the Marciano settlement. These actions were filed by and on behalf of
Massachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized
the DoorDash platform since August 2016. The settlement was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of
San Francisco on November 21, 2019. On April 24, 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues
with the filed settlement agreement and requesting supplemental briefing from the parties. On June 8, 2020, the
parties submitted supplemental briefing and an amended settlement agreement to the court. The amended settlement
agreement increased the total amount to be paid by us from $40 million to $41 million. On June 19, 2020, the court
issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues with the filed amended settlement agreement and requesting
supplemental briefing from the parties. On July 24, 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and an
amended settlement agreement to the court. On August 31, 2020, the court issued a tentative ruling denying
plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of the amended settlement without prejudice and inviting the parties to
file supplemental briefing addressing the concerns raised by the court. On October 30, 2020, we entered into an
amended settlement agreement to increase the total amount to be paid by us from $41 million to $89 million. On
November 4, 2020, the parties submitted supplemental briefing and the amended settlement agreement to the court. On
February 17, 2021, the court issued a tentative ruling denying plaintiff’s motion for preliminary approval of the
amended settlement without prejudice. On April 7, 2021, plaintiffs filed a notice of withdrawal of the motion for
preliminary approval of the settlement. In light of the court’s concern about the plaintiffs releasing various
class claims that were not originally pled in the Marciano action (which was filed as a PAGA-only case), the
parties agreed not to seek a release of these claims Marciano, but to instead present a new proposed settlement in
Marko v DoorDash, Inc., Case No. BC659841 (Los Angeles Super. Ct.), where the court currently has jurisdiction over
the various class claims under the Labor Code encompassed by the agreement. On April 16, 2021, plaintiffs filed a
revised settlement agreement with the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, or the Marko settlement.
The total amount to be paid by us is $100 million. If the Marko settlement ultimately receives final approval from
the court, we expect that this would resolve claims under PAGA and claims alleging worker misclassification for
Dashers in California for the period of August 30, 2016 through December 31, 2020 and claims alleging worker
misclassification for Dashers in Massachusetts for the period of September 26, 2014 through March 31, 2021.
Although the settlement only involves claimants in certain actions, any final settlement would be on a class basis
and would encompass claims by all Dashers in California and Massachusetts for the period noted in the previous
sentence. Dashers that are members of the class purported to be covered by the settlement could elect to opt out of
such settlement, and therefore could bring claims against us separately.

More than 35,000 Dashers and Caviar delivery providers who have entered into arbitration agreements with us have
filed or expressed an intention to file arbitration demands against us that assert worker misclassification claims.
As of May 13, 2021, we have reached agreements that would resolve the worker misclassification claims for the
substantial majority of these individuals. Under these agreements, certain Dashers and Caviar delivery providers
are eligible for settlement payments, subject to a threshold number of the covered individuals entering into
individual settlement agreements. As of May 13, 2021, individual settlement agreements have been executed and
amounts paid thereunder, in an aggregate amount of approximately $75 million, including attorneys’ fees, and
covering approximately 23,000 Dashers and Caviar delivery providers. Final amounts to be paid under the remaining
settlement agreements will be determined based on the number of releases collected from Dashers and Caviar delivery
providers. We anticipate that the aggregate amount of payments to Dashers and Caviar delivery providers under the
remaining settlement agreements, including attorneys’ fees, will be approximately $8 million. We do not admit any
allegations of wrongdoing as part of the resolution of these matters.

Various other Dashers and Caviar delivery providers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge
in the future, their classification on the DoorDash platform and on the Caviar platform, respectively, as an
independent contractor under federal and state law, seeking monetary, injunctive, or other relief. We are currently
involved in a number of such actions filed by individual Dashers and Caviar delivery providers, with many
additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our Independent Contractor
Agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an
action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified Dashers as
independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair
Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent
injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as independent contractors. In August 2020, the
San Francisco District Attorney filed a motion for preliminary injunction that would bar us from continuing to
classify Dashers in California as independent contractors during the pendency of this case. In December 2020, the
San Francisco District Attorney withdrew its request for preliminary injunction. It is a reasonable possibility
that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.

We have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform
can continue to operate in the United States, Canada, and Australia. New laws and regulations and changes to
existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and
related technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law on September
18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor
classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies,
supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative titled Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve
flexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020, and which became effective in December 2020. In addition,
several other states where we operate may be considering adopting legislation similar to Proposition 22, which we
would expect to increase our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions, could result in lower order volumes if
we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, and could also adversely impact our results of
operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation have
been and may in the future be challenged and subject to litigation. Additionally, an increasing number of
jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to AB 5 to determine worker classification.

We believe we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend ourselves
vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of
defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and other
factors.
                                                                                                                   
  Consumer Protection and Other Actions                                                                            
                                                                                                                   
We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the
ordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,
alleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, and other laws. In addition, we have been
subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and our Dasher pay model. We
dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.

From time to time, we are involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other
intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive correspondence from other purported
holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or asserting infringement
of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these
matters.

Regulatory and Administrative Investigations, Audits, and Inquiries

We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative
investigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our
business practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers and Caviar delivery providers, our Dasher pay
model, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and other
matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of the State of
California for payroll tax liabilities. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related governmental
action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry
having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event
that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other
action.

Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with
cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources, and other factors.
                                                                                                                   
  Personal Injury Matters                                                                                          
                                                                                                                   
We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the involved in Legal Proceedings where various
parties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have
been active on the DoorDash platform or Caviar delivery providers who have been active on the Caviar platform. We
are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers
that utilize the DoorDash platform, Caviar delivery providers on the Caviar platform, and third parties. In many of
these matters, we believe we have meritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or
incidents that individually, in our opinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial
condition, or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and
legal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an
adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of
management resources, and other factors.

Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and
uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,
including the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations” and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to
invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could
also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are
material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and
prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline,
and you could lose part or all of your investment.
                                                                                                                   
  Risk Factors Summary                                                                                             
                                                                                                                   
Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could
cause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:

• We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future
prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;

• We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to
maintain or increase profitability in the future;

• We may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;

• If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, or if we fail to comply with Proposition 22
in the State of California, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely
affected;

• We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations would be adversely affected;

• If we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-
effective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected;

• If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing
Dashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;

• We rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and any failure by them to maintain their
service levels or any changes to their operating costs could adversely affect our business;

• We are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability,
expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business;

• Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including those related to worker
classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and the
costs of complying with such laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations, could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;

• We expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,
which may make it difficult to predict our future performance;

• Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;

• The COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue,
Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline
as a result of a widespread COVID-19 vaccine rollout;

• The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment;
and

• The multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy, or the Voting
Agreement, between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang, or our Co-Founders, has the effect of concentrating voting
power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, which will limit
your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including the election
of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and
                                                        41

the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate
transaction. Future issuances of our Class C common stock, if any, will not dilute the voting control of Mr. Xu,
but will dilute his economic interest which could cause his interests to conflict with your interests. Further, the
issuance of shares of Class C common stock, whether to Mr. Xu or to other stockholders, could prolong the duration
of Mr. Xu’s voting control.
                                                                                                                   
   Risks Related to Our Business and Operations                                                                    
                                                                                                                   
We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future
prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.

We launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed
our pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate
our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability
to:

• accurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;

• increase the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;

• successfully compete with current and future competitors;

• successfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets and geographies;

• anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;

• maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;

• adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;

• avoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;

• develop a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased
usage, as well as the deployment of new features and services;

• hire, integrate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;

• effectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and

• effectively manage our costs related to Dashers.

If we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges
listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical
financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may
not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.
We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced
by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding
these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do
not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to
maintain or increase profitability in the future.

Although we generated net income of $23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, we have incurred net
losses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to
maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $129 million and $110 million in the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, we had
an accumulated deficit of $1.6 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. We expect our costs will increase over time
and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and
operating as a public company. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other
resources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new
platform features and services, expanding into new markets and geographies, and increasing our sales and marketing
efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our
business. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses
could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or
                                                        42

positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we
encounter them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

In addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our Restricted Stock Units ("RSUs") and other
outstanding equity awards will result in increases in our expenses in future periods. As of March 31, 2021, we had
$1.2 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards.
Additionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations
that arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs. For more information, see “—We have expended and
intend to expend substantial funds to satisfy a portion of our tax withholding and remittance obligations that
arise in connection with the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs, which may have an adverse effect on
our financial condition and results of operations. We have also implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our
Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf of RSU holders upon vesting and/or settlement of RSUs to
cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result in dilution to our stockholders.”

If we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant
losses in the future and may not be able to maintain or increase profitability.

We may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.

We have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our recent revenue growth rate and financial
performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. For the three months ended March 31,
2020 and 2021, our revenue was $362 million and $1.1 billion, respectively, representing a 198% year-over-year
growth rate. In addition, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total
Orders, and Marketplace GOV. The circumstances that have accelerated the growth of our business stemming from the
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine,
and we expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline in future periods. You should
not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of
our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business metrics growth in future periods. In particular,
our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods. We expect our revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate
over the short term and decline in the long term. Our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods as the size
of our business grows and as we achieve higher market adoption rates. We may also experience declines in our
revenue growth rate as a result of a number of factors, including slowing demand for our platform, insufficient
growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing competition, a
decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities,
increasing regulatory costs, and the maturation of our business, among others. We also expect to continue to make
investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may not result in increased revenue or growth.
In addition, we have strategically focused on suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas since our founding
because of the opportunity that these markets have presented for our local logistics platform. If the demand for
local logistics platforms does not continue to grow in these markets, or if we are unable to maintain our category
share in these markets, our revenue growth rate could be adversely affected. If our revenue growth rate declines,
investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely
affected.

We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations would be adversely affected.

The markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,
fragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery
logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United
States, we compete with other local food delivery logistics companies, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub (pending
acquisition by Just Eat Takeaway), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have
their own online ordering platforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems such as Toast and
ChowNow, other merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, and
companies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand our
presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In addition, we
compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that
merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract
consumers. Changing traditional ordering habits is difficult, and if merchants and consumers do not embrace the
transition to local food delivery logistics as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

Our current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer
operating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established
relationships with
                                                        43                                                         
Table of Contents
local merchants and larger existing user bases in certain markets, more successful marketing capabilities, and
substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. Greater financial resources and
product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging
technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less attractive
or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic market, or if
merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of
merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing
to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic relationships
among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, Uber acquired Postmates in December 2020, Just
Eat Takeaway, a European local logistics platform, announced that it has entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire Grubhub, and Lyft announced a partnership with Grubhub that allows Lyft’s loyalty-program members free
delivery from Grubhub restaurants. In addition, certain of our competitors have acquired kitchens to enable them to
produce and deliver food directly to consumers. Our competitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive
price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than ours. Additionally,
many of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and
consumer fees, incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services and consumer discounts and
promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, which may be more attractive than those
that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission rates and fees or
maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions in order to remain competitive, particularly in
markets where we do not have a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will continue to
negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful.
Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding
sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments,
along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their
prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively
against us. Delivery logistics services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are nascent, and we
cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to maintain or increase
profitability. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with large Internet companies with
substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and Google. Further, merchants could determine that
it is more cost-effective to develop their own platforms to offer online pickup and delivery rather than use our
platform.

In addition, within our industry, the cost to switch between offerings is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift
to the lowest-cost provider and could use more than one local logistics platform, independent contractors who
provide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and
merchants could prefer to use the local logistics platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more
than one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as
existing offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may
adopt certain of our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more
highly than ours, which would render our platform less attractive and reduce our ability to differentiate our
platform. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from
the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.

For all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or
Dashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce
our commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.

If we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-
effective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

We believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow
our platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in
new markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers
attracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or than it has grown
in the past. In particular, our national brand partnerships are a key component of our strategy to provide a wide
selection for consumers. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants
and our national brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. In addition, we expect
to continue to incur substantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our
operations into new markets to acquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar
competitive environments, and we may invest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such
investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. We
                                                        44

cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of
acquisition.

In addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial
distress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may
not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with
restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have
fewer merchants. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants
enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,
or if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until
terminated by partner merchants or us. Based on the type of partner agreement, partner merchants may generally
terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do
not generally provide for any exclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with
us, the merchant selection available on our local logistics platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our
business and to our relationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain
other constituencies. For example, the increased growth of our subscription product, DashPass, and how compelling
this offering is to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to DashPass. Additionally, many
of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and other
reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such consumers, thereby
encouraging them to access our platform regularly or subscribe as a paid user of DashPass, through prompts and
notifications and time-limited trials of DashPass and other offerings. However, these consumers may never convert
to a paid subscription to DashPass or access our platform after they take advantage of our promotions. If we are
not able to continue to expand our consumer base or fail to convert our consumers to regular paying consumers,
demand for our full-price or paid services, such as DashPass, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or
decline.

Further, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites
and applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and
applications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If
consumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than
through our website and consumer mobile application directly, our ability to establish relationships and build
brand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized
experience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract
and retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing
Dashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our
screening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. To attract and retain
Dashers, we have, among other things, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, such as credits to be used for
orders on our platform, free DoorDash-branded apparel, and access to Dasher Experience Centers where Dashers can
receive assistance with pressing issues, meet other Dashers, and participate in special events. If we do not
continue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income, and other
incentive programs that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, we may fail to attract new Dashers
or retain existing Dashers or increase their use of our platform. For example, if merchants and consumers choose to
use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived
utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We also frequently test Dasher
incentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and
retain Dashers or fail to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have other unintended adverse
consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment
laws, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or
higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our control, such as increases in the price of
gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our
platform by Dashers. Our agreements with Dashers generally remain in effect until terminated by Dashers or us.
Dashers may generally terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven days advance notice and
such agreements do not provide for any exclusivity. If we fail to attract Dashers or retain existing Dashers on
favorable terms, if we fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, or if Dashers terminate their
agreements with us, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain
their service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, either as a result of increased
operating costs, or to offset the commission we charge, our business would be adversely affected.

We rely upon merchants on our platform, including small and local independent businesses, to provide quality goods
to our consumers at expected price points. If these merchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand,
producing quality goods at affordable prices, or meeting our other requirements or standards, or experience
problems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, our reputation and brand could be damaged. Further, an
increase in merchant operating costs could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission
rates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our operational costs and efficiency, and if
merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide
consumers with sufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform.
Many of the factors affecting merchant operating costs, including off-premise costs and prices, are beyond the
control of merchants and include inflation, costs associated with the goods provided, labor and employee benefit
costs, rent costs, and energy costs. If merchants pass along these increased operating costs and increase prices on
our platform, order volume may decline. Additionally, some merchants choose to charge higher prices on our platform
relative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and
could result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations.

We expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,
which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.

Our results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of
operations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of
factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-
period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”
section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:

• our ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective
manner;

• our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;

• the effects of increased competition on our business;

• our ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;

• changes in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;

• increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,
consumers, and Dashers;

• our business mix between Marketplace and Drive;

• the proportion of consumers that subscribe to DashPass;

• the impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand
delivery;

• the seasonality of our business, particularly with respect to local food delivery logistics, including the effect
of academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;

• the impact of weather on our business;

• our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;

• our ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;

• the effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;

• our ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;

• the success of our sales and marketing efforts;

• the effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;

• our ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;

• changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the
classification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to
merchants;

• interruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;

• the attraction and engagement of qualified employees and key personnel;

• our ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service providers;

• the effects of natural or man-made catastrophic events;

• the effect the widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has on consumer behavior and our order volumes;

• the impact that price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms imposed by various jurisdictions, and
any associated increase in the fees we charge to consumers, have on our operating results;

• the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;

• the impact of payment processor costs and procedures;

• changes in the online payment transfer rate; and

• changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.

The variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our
expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations
for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common
stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.

Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

It is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.
Our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or
other performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service
and other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural
disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,
terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to
break-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems
are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our
business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions
in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.

We have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time
to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These
system failures generally occur either as a result of software updates being deployed with unexpected errors or as
a result of temporary infrastructure failures related to storage, network, or compute capacity being exhausted.
These events have resulted in losses in revenue, though such losses have not been material to date. System failures
in the future could result in significant losses of revenue. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided
credits to consumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar
event, including for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may
voluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, the affected user could seek monetary recourse
from us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to
address. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance
problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the
availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and
could result in the loss of users.

The COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total
Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline as a
result of a successful COVID-19 vaccine rollout.
                                                        47

The current outbreak of COVID-19 has globally resulted in loss of life, business closures, restrictions on travel,
and widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business
will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including:

• new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease;

• the duration and spread of the outbreak;

• the severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary
business closures;

• regulatory actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant
pricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings;

• other business disruptions that affect our workforce;

• the availability of effective vaccines and the speed at which they can be administered to the public;

• the continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19;

• the impact on capital and financial markets; and

• actions taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or
treat its impact.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken active measures to promote health and safety, including
providing for no-contact delivery, distributing masks, hand sanitizer, and gloves to Dashers in affected areas, and
working closely with merchants to share safety guidelines. However, our efforts may not be successful and we may
not have sufficient protection or recovery plans to continue to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic or similar public
health threats in the future. In connection with public health threats, we may also be required to temporarily
close our corporate offices and have our employees work remotely, as we have done in connection with the COVID-19
pandemic, which impacts productivity and otherwise disrupts our business operations. In addition, the current
outbreak of COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and
financial markets, and similar public health threats could do so in the future. Such events have impacted, and
could in the future impact, demand for merchants and consumer purchase patterns, which in turn, could adversely
affect our revenue and results of operations.

With the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace
GOV due to increased consumer demand for delivery, more merchants using our platform to facilitate both delivery
and take-out, and improved efficiency of our local logistics platform. The circumstances that have accelerated the
growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue following a
widespread rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine, and we expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth
rates to decline in future periods.

Furthermore, if a virus or other disease is transmitted by human contact, as is the case with COVID-19, our
employees and any constituent of our network may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid any
contact with others, any of which may adversely affect our ability to provide our platform and for merchants,
consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. In addition, shelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact
merchants’ ability to operate their businesses, consumers’ ability to pick up orders, and Dashers’ ability to make
deliveries during certain times, or at all. Further, demand from businesses that typically place large orders for
their employees or in-person meetings may be significantly reduced. With the COVID-19 pandemic, our DoorDash for
Work offering has been limited to providing large group orders solely to businesses that are deemed essential and
we have also temporarily paused catering orders. Such events have in the past caused, and may in the future cause,
a temporary closure of merchants’ businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary preventative measures,
and many of our merchants may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their businesses, and may be
forced to go out of business. Even if merchants are able to continue to operate their businesses, many may operate
with limited hours, menus, and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or disruptions or closures of
merchants’ businesses could impact the selection available on our platform, disrupt our ability to operate our
local logistics platform, and adversely affect our business.

Even if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived
risk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Merchants may be perceived as
unsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our
platform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar
public health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform
would be adversely affected. Any negative

impact on consumers’ willingness or ability to order delivery or complete a Pickup order, or on Dashers’
willingness or ability to make deliveries, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely
to also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section.

Our pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting
and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms will
have an adverse impact on our results of operations.

Demand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the
amount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the
fees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and
regulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing
strategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, in connection with the COVID-19
pandemic, jurisdictions across the United States, including Massachusetts, Oregon, jurisdictions within Los Angeles
County, California, San Francisco, California, Washington, D.C., and New York, New York, have implemented temporary
price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative proposals to make
price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be made. While
several jurisdictions initially proposed permanent price controls but then implemented temporary price controls,
other jurisdictions may implement permanent price controls in the future . These price controls have had in the
past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These price controls
have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers, though we are aware
of two jurisdictions that have adopted limits or explicit prohibitions against doing so in connection with price
controls. An increase in the fees we charge to consumers could result in reduced demand for our services by
consumers. With the continued duration of COVID-19, we expect these existing price controls to persist in the near
term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If any of these events
occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory scrutiny or action may
create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which creates additional
challenges to managing our business. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or
a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to
attract or retain new merchants, consumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be no assurance that we
will not be forced, through competition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of delivery for consumers,
increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform, or further reduce the fees and commissions we
charge merchants, or to increase our marketing and other expenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and
Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new pricing
strategies and initiatives, such as subscription products like DashPass, and Dasher or consumer loyalty programs,
or modify existing pricing methodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our
platform, any of which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or
Dashers or which may result in lower commissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. For example, on April 27, 2021, we changed our merchant pricing models to
better support certain U.S. restaurant partners, including by offering them a choice of three different delivery
commission rates tied to varying levels of marketing support and services. Further, our consumers’ price
sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing methodologies may not enable us to
compete effectively in these locations. In particular, our continued international expansion may require us to
change our pricing strategies and to adjust to different cultural norms, including with respect to consumer pricing
and gratuities. While we do and will attempt to set prices based on our prior operating experience and merchant,
consumer, and Dasher feedback and engagement levels, our assessments may not be accurate or there may be errors in
the technology used in our pricing and we could be underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the
services on our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies.

We face certain risks associated with our pay model for Dashers.

Our pay model for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to
lead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under our former
Dasher pay model, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little
or no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile,
it also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being
received by Dashers. Government authorities have also brought claims against us related to our former Dasher pay
model and may bring similar claims in the future. For example, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed
an action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia’s
Consumer Protection Procedures Act with
                                                        49                                                         
Table of Contents
respect to our former Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent order and judgment to
resolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former Dasher pay model from other government
authorities in the future.

The incorrect understanding or perception of our former Dasher pay model by some led, and may continue to lead, to
some consumers providing lower tips, or no tips at all, to Dashers, which could impact the amount that Dashers are
able to earn on our platform and our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We have also launched, and may in the
future launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that utilize our platform, which may not
ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers. For example, in September 2019, we changed our Dasher
pay model to include (i) a base pay amount for each order, which depends on the estimated time, distance, and
desirability of the order, (ii) promotions for orders that meet certain conditions, including bonuses for Dashers
who meet specific goals, and (iii) tips from consumers, which Dashers receive 100% of on top of base pay and
promotions. Dashers are shown the minimum amount that they will earn for each delivery opportunity when it is
offered.

We increased the amount we pay to Dashers per order when we changed to our current pay model, but our current
Dasher pay model may also cause less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some cases. Further, this pay
model may lead to negative publicity related to perceptions of the complexity of the pay model, inconsistency in
earnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be
successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the future, based on a variety of
factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may change our pay model again. Our current pay model, and any
future changes to our pay model or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an
increase to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain
consumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Further, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that
Dashers may be reclassified as employees under federal or state law. As discussed further below, we have been
involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such
proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West,
Inc. v. Superior Court , or Dynamex, including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June
2020. In addition, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test
set forth in Dynamex to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which
was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5
codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous
carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for a 2020 ballot initiative, or
Proposition 22, to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020
and went into effect in December 2020. Under Proposition 22, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with
certain other requirements, are now applicable to us and Dashers in California and our costs related to Dashers
have increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we will in certain circumstances charge
higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time and adversely impact our results
of operations. In addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation
that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in
ongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work
that Dashers perform. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related
to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if
we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, and our results of operations would be adversely
impacted. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could
still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior
Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22 and similar challenges may also be filed. In addition, we
could face further challenges to the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors
as other states where we operate are considering adopting similar legislation or regulations. A reclassification of
Dashers or delivery service providers using a local logistics platform as employees could require us to revise our
pricing methodologies and pay model to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other
substantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a Dasher to an employment position, which would
have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term
financial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our
stock price being adversely affected.

We are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on
driving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-
quality
                                                        50

support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business decisions
that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to
improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These
decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-
term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

Since 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our
geographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. For example,
Employee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquarters and in a number of our offices across the
United States and internationally. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on
management and our operational and financial infrastructure. For example, in connection with the audit of our
consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent
registered public accounting firm identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting,
which has since been remediated. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial
reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that could result in a restatement of our
financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish
investor confidence in us and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock. We will need to
continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure in order to manage our business effectively and
accurately report our results of operations.

As with many companies in our growth stage, a majority of our employees have been with us for fewer than 24 months.
We have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and
sales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,
technologies, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and
financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new
employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge our ability to
develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and
procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if
we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our platform and the
efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand, business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Growth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand and any failure to maintain, protect, and
enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our
ability to increase their level of engagement.

We believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network
effects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract
and retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more
important as competition in our industry further intensifies. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing
our reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the success of our
marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our ability to
successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” mark, our logo, and other trademarks
important to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe
that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives
new consumer growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our
consumers have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local logistics platforms and
services, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our consumer base, we must appeal
to new consumers who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local logistics
platforms.

Our reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be
adversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize
our platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Negative
perception of our platform or company may harm our reputation, brand, and local network effects, including as a
result of:

• complaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and
guidelines, including Dasher pay;

• missing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;

• illegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;

• food tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;

• a pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network
become infected;

• a failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or to pay Dashers competitively;

• negative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;

• a failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;

• perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,
merchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or

• any of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects
the public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.

If we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network
effects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and
new merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to
be reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,
we may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,
any of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In
addition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,
consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but
negatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance
the interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,
and Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely
affect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Unfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, pay
model, user support, technology, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues, privacy or security
practices, management team or the safety of Dashers, merchants and consumers using our platform could adversely
affect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and
loyalty of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

For example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which Dashers were
compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general food safety
and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers and merchants using our platform, which has
adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to scale and public awareness of our brand
increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an amplified negative effect on our reputation and
brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands or influencers that we have partnered with may damage
our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to us. Any negative publicity that we may receive
could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which could adversely affect our business.

We have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any
actual or perceived security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our brand, and adversely affect
our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive
and proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary
information relating to our business, such as our own proprietary information and personal data relating to our
employees. An increasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses,
other large Internet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of
their information security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved
sophisticated and highly targeted attacks. In addition, these incidents could originate on our vendors’ platforms,
vendors' systems, or with our vendors’ personnel, which could then be leveraged to access our website and
platforms. We have previously experienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in September
2019, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors that resulted in the unauthorized acquisition of certain
Dashers’ driver licenses as well as data related to certain of our consumers. This incident has resulted in
regulatory inquiries and is the subject of litigation. To date, this incident has not resulted in a material loss
of revenue or the incurrence of material expenses. We have undertaken steps to enhance our data security and
governance program, which include adding additional protective security layers around the data, improving security
protocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside expertise to increase our ability to identify
and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of the incident have been identified and
remediated or will not lead to recurrence or similar incidents. While we maintain cyber insurance that may help
provide coverage for these types of incidents, we cannot assure you that our insurance will be adequate to cover
costs and liabilities related to this incident.

Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and
may not be known until launched against us, we may be unable to anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a
timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we may face delays in our detection or remediation
of, or other responses to, security breaches and other privacy- and security-related incidents. Unauthorized
parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities used in our
business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or those of
merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, attempting to fraudulently induce our employees,
merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information,
or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology, or IT, systems, or
attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, or others into manipulating payment information,
resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors.

In addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to
our systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches
experienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are
becoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to
identify and prevent. We have previously experienced incidents of fraud on our platform that we believe involve
credential stuffing attacks, which we have been unable to detect or prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored
or supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect,
remediate, and otherwise respond to.

Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect the personal data of merchants,
consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, protect our systems, prevent data loss, and prevent other
security breaches and security incidents, these security measures have not fully protected our systems in the past
and cannot guarantee security in the future. The IT and infrastructure used in our business may be vulnerable to
cyberattacks or security breaches, and third parties may be able to access data, including personal data and other
sensitive and proprietary data of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, our employees’ personal data, or our other
sensitive and proprietary data, accessible through those systems. Employee error, malfeasance, or other errors in
the storage, use, or transmission of any of these types of data could result in an actual or perceived privacy or
security breach or other security incident. Although we have policies restricting the access to the personal
information we store, there is a risk that
                                                        53                                                         
Table of Contents
these policies may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy, or any actual or
perceived security breach or other incidents, could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being
unavailable, result in loss or improper access to, or acquisition or disclosure of, data, result in fraudulent
transfer of funds, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, damage our relationships with third-party
partners, or result in claims, regulatory investigations, and proceedings and significant legal, regulatory, and
financial exposure, including ongoing monitoring by regulators, and any such incidents or any perception that our
security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence in, or decreased
use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy or security, or other security incident, impacting any
entities with which we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers) could
have similar effects. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived security and privacy breaches and other
incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a
result, reduce confidence in us. We also expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect and prevent
privacy and security breaches and other privacy- and security-related incidents, and we may face increased costs
and requirements to expend substantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived privacy or security breach
or other incident.

Additionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any security breach or incident, regardless of their
merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be
adequate for data handling or data security costs or liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to
be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any
future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that exceed available insurance
coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of
large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

The markets for local food delivery logistics and our other delivery logistics services are still in relatively
early stages of growth, and if these markets do not continue to grow, grow slower than we expect, or fail to grow
as large as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

The local food delivery logistics market has grown rapidly since we launched our local logistics platform in 2013,
but it is still relatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at
all. In addition, the market for the other delivery logistics services we facilitate, such as grocery delivery
services, is also relatively nascent, and it is uncertain whether demand for grocery delivery services or other
delivery logistics services we may facilitate in the future will continue to grow and achieve wide market
acceptance, if at all. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt
local food delivery logistics and the other delivery logistics services we facilitate. If the public does not
perceive these services as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result of concerns regarding safety,
affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’
platforms or otherwise, or instead adopts alternative solutions that may arise, then the market for our platform
may not further develop, may develop slower than we expect, or may not achieve the growth potential we expect, any
of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not
occurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the
activities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services
offered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers or the
activities of Dashers while making deliveries to our consumers, have occurred, and in the future may occur, which
could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities
include food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, assault, battery,
theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering
Dasher accounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such
activities may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business
interruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.

We have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of
stolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to
background checks, fraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, attempted payments
by consumers with insufficient funds, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers
of Dasher accounts by bad actors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities
involving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information, or
payment information and
                                                        54                                                         
Table of Contents
unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information, and mobile phone
numbers. For example, bad actors have created Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal identifying
information to commit fraud on our platform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, this has caused
Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as Dashers. We have launched a
series of initiatives and products changes to help prevent this practice.

Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit
card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we
have taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot
guarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to
adequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or
regulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.

While we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of
activities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate
activity by these parties from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through
litigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we have deactivated
from our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform deliveries. At
the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate
activities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check, are too restrictive and
inadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable
to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the
growth and engagement of the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be
adversely affected. In addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal,
improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which
enables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are
retained directly by merchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in
any of the other activities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on our platform. Further,
any negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our
competitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a
whole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory
or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

Our platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated
with these deliveries.

We aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which includes facilitating deliveries to consumers
from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less operationally
efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner merchants’
systems. For example, for orders with most partner merchants, Dashers have an expedited checkout process that does
not require a separate payment in store, but for orders with non-partner merchants, Dashers may have to place and
pay for the order separately in store. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each
order, more time and manual processes needed to place each order, and a higher likelihood of errors. Further, we
sometimes unintentionally incorrectly price non-partner goods on our platform as a result of inaccuracies that
occur when capturing menu prices. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated
with facilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and
cause damage to our reputation and brand. While our goal is to convert non-partner merchants into partner
merchants, our inability to do so at a sufficiently high rate, or at all, could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Further, some non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed.
While we honor these requests, removing non-partner merchants impacts our ability to provide a broad selection of
merchants. In addition, there is a risk that non-partner merchants bring legal claims against us relating to their
inclusion on our platform. For example, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair
competition, among other claims, and sought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. There is
also a risk that state or local law is enacted to prevent platforms like ours from including non-partners on the
platform. For example, the California Legislature passed legislation, California Assembly Bill 2149, or AB 2149,
which was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and became effective on January 1, 2021. AB 2149 prohibits,
among other things, food delivery logistics platforms from facilitating deliveries from restaurants in California
without the restaurants’ prior consent. Similar prohibitions have also been enacted in Louisiana, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Arkansas, Virginia, Denver, Colorado, and Tucson, Arizona and are being contemplated in other
jurisdictions. Beyond regulatory restrictions, we may also adopt internal policies that limit or prohibit the
facilitation of deliveries from merchants without their prior consent. For example, in
                                                        55                                                         
Table of Contents
November 2020, we adopted internal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants
for delivery on our platform in the United States and such policies require the use of disclaimers with existing
non-partner restaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not
partnered with DoorDash. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we
may continue to revise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To
the extent we are required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this will adversely affect
our ability to attract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

If we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we
are not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and
results of operations could suffer.

Our success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain
competitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our
website and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail
to expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance
and improve our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely
affected. If competitors introduce new offerings embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and
practices emerge, our existing technology, services, website, and mobile applications may become obsolete. Our
future success could depend on our ability to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and
practices in a cost-effective and timely manner.

We have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted
in, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and
launching enhancements to our platform and new services on our platform may involve significant technical risks and
upfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively,
or we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced
platform features and services or if our recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our
expectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in
favor of those of our competitors.

Our marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.

Promoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,
consumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,
and Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts
currently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,
television, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified
advertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our
marketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may
be difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset
the additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,
we expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Any failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and
could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide
high-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues
relating to our platform. We rely on third-parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide
effective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are
not only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to
grow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support
services at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of international
users on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with
delivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market
perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability
to scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.
                                                        56

If we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local logistics platform, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our ability to provide a cost-effective local logistics platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher
efficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our local logistics platform and
while we continue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology,
including enhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our
routing and batching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the
resulting gains in efficiency to our platform that we expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the
cost of our business and subject to a number of risks, including changes to our Dasher pay model. The cost
effectiveness of our local logistics platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological
improvements do not reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and
credits. If we are unable to maintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our local logistics platform, including
with respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

We experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common
stock price to fluctuate.

Our business is highly dependent on consumer spending and Dasher behavior patterns that have an impact on our
growth and expenses. We generally experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the calendar year,
although our rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to make, seasonal
fluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity can be impacted by colder or more inclement
weather, which typically increases consumer demand, and warmer or sunny weather, which typically decreases consumer
demand. In addition, the number of available Dashers generally decreases during periods of inclement weather, but
consumer demand during these times requires us to have more Dashers available to fulfill orders. During these
times, we rely on incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which
increases our costs. Further, severe weather in certain areas can cause businesses, including restaurants, to
close, and make it impossible for Dashers to make deliveries if roads are closed or difficult to drive on. In
addition, we benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we experience
a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation periods,
causing a similar decrease in Dasher pay. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a
quarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience
may become more pronounced and contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to scale and
our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations. However, we base our spending
and investment plans on forecasts and estimates, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if
our revenue is less than expected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the
expectations of investors.

The impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending, may adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the
factors having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment,
consumer debt, reductions in net worth, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices,
interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic factors. Consumer purchases of discretionary items
generally decline during recessionary periods and other periods in which disposable income is adversely affected.
Economic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes,
wildfires, and threats to public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, small businesses that do not have
substantial resources, like some of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor
economic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or
permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with
sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform. This risk is particularly
pronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in
markets where we have fewer merchants. In addition, because spending for purchases from many of the merchants on
our platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that any decline in consumer spending would
have a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses that sell products or services
considered to be necessities. If spending at the merchants on our platform declines, consumers may be less likely
to use our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
                                                        57

We may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new local markets in which we have limited or no prior
operating experience.

Our capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete
effectively in, new local markets. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict consumer
preferences and purchasing habits in these new local markets. In addition, each market has unique regulatory
dynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the
pool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with insurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new
Dashers. In addition, each market is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our
ability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently attract and
retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key business
metrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in
the local markets where we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are
unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be
adversely affected.

Our presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to
additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.

We have started expanding our presence internationally. We launched our platform in Canada in 2015 and in Australia
in 2019, and we expect to expand our international operations. Operating outside of the United States may require
significant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and
customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations
teams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a
variety of reasons, including:

• recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture
across all of our offices;

• an inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;

• competition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more
effectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;

• differing demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;

• complying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to labor and employment, data
privacy, tax, and local regulatory restrictions;

• obtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;

• varying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;

• currency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;

• operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same
extent as the United States;

• public health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or
viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in
which we operate or may operate in the future; and

• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.

Our limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future
expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to
expand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may increase
our risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery,
export controls, and trade and economic sanctions.

If we or our partners fail to develop and successfully commercialize autonomous or drone delivery technologies or
fail to develop such technologies before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected,
change our cost structure materially, are inferior to those of our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than
those of our competitors or non-autonomous or non-drone delivery methods, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.
                                                        58

We believe that autonomous and drone delivery technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact our
industry. We have invested and we expect to continue to invest in research and development related to autonomous
and drone delivery technologies, either directly or in partnership with companies that develop such technologies.
While we believe that autonomous and drone delivery could present substantial opportunities, the development of
such technologies is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Autonomous and drone delivery
technologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Failures of our or our partners’ autonomous or drone
delivery technologies could generate substantial liability, create negative publicity, or result in regulatory
scrutiny, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, results of operations, and
prospects. Even if our or our partners’ efforts to develop autonomous and drone delivery technologies are
successful, such efforts may not be cost-effective and there is no guarantee that such technologies can reduce our
current costs of facilitating on-demand delivery services. Further, several other companies, including Uber and
Amazon, are also developing autonomous and drone delivery technologies, either themselves or through
collaborations, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the local logistics
industry. Certain competitors may commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies at scale before we or
our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone delivery to market before we do, or
their technology is or is perceived to be superior to our or our partners’ technology, they may be able to leverage
such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations. For example, if competitors develop autonomous and drone delivery
technologies that successfully reduce the cost of facilitating delivery logistics services, these competitors could
offer their services at lower prices as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a
significant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Further, we expect that governments will develop regulations that are specifically designed to apply to autonomous
and drone technologies. These regulations could include requirements that significantly delay or narrowly limit the
commercialization of autonomous and drone technologies, limit the amount of autonomous and drone delivery on our
platform, or impose significant liabilities on manufacturers or operators of these solutions or developers of these
technologies. Moreover, these regulations may affect our or our partners’ ability to design and manufacture new
autonomous or drone technologies. For example, commercial drone regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation
Administration limit the altitude, available airspace, and weight of a drone and also the certification of remote
pilots that can operate a drone for commercial purposes in the United States. If regulations of this nature
continue to be implemented, we or our partners may not be able to commercialize autonomous and drone delivery
technologies in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or our partners are unable to comply with existing
or new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous and drone solutions, we could become subject to substantial
fines or penalties.

If we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our
business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.

As part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions,
including acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments that
complement our business. For exa mple, in October 2019, we acquired certain assets and liabilities from Square,
Inc. related to Caviar, a marketplace focused on facilitating deliveries from p remium restaurants. We have
previously acquired and continue to evaluate targets that operate in relatively nascent markets, and as a result,
there is no assurance that such acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into our business or generate
substantial revenue.

Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial
condition and results of operations, including:

• intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and adversely affect our
ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;

• failure or material delay in closing a transaction;

• transaction-related lawsuits or claims;

• difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel of an acquired
company;

• difficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;

• difficulties in retaining merchants, consumers, and delivery service providers, as applicable, of an acquired
company;

• challenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;

• diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition
opportunities;
                                                        59                                                         
Table of Contents
• failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;

• failure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or
technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue
recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;

• risks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired
company or business;

• risks that regulatory bodies do not approve our acquisitions or business combinations or delay such approvals;

• theft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;

• risk that an acquired company or investment in new services cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and

• adverse market reaction to an acquisition.

If we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future
acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments, or if we fail
to successfully integrate such acquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of
operations could be adversely affected.

We depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,
manage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to
grow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key
technical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive
Officer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may
not be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.
Also, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will
basis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in
recruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find
suitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain
the necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In
addition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our
business. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies,
our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a
substantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,
and we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates
and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their
employment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in
response to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this
or other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of
our employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our
employees may receive significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their
motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and
retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train, and integrate such
employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring
needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, and employee morale,
productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

Our company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our
business could be adversely affected.

We believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,
has been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our
corporate culture, including:

• failure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and
further our culture, values, and mission;
                                                        60

• the increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;

• competitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;

• the continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;

• the increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;

• negative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee
sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and

• the integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.

If we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected.

Our business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.

Our business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet. We
may operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally.
Internet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with
significant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability
to access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any
particular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed
and availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for
a short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.

If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,
our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be
impaired.

As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and the rules and
regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of
these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make
some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems,
and resources.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and
other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we
will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC
rules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal
control over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement
such processes and controls. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for
the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2019, we and our independent registered public accounting firm identified a
material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. To address this material weakness, we hired
additional accounting, engineering, and business intelligence personnel and implemented process level and
management review controls to identify and address emerging risks. While we believe this material weakness has been
remediated as of December 31, 2020, we cannot assure you that we have identified all of our existing material
weaknesses, or that we will not in the future have additional material weaknesses.

In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control
over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,
including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls
and systems, or the existing systems and third party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,
do not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet
our financial reporting obligations.

Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in
our business. Further, additional weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial
reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any
difficulties encountered in their
                                                        61                                                         
Table of Contents
implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting
obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement
and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of
periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports
regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to
include in our periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and
internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial
and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock.
In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the
New York Stock Exchange. We are not currently required to comply with the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and are therefore not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting for that purpose. As a public company, we are required to provide an
annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting commencing with our
second annual report on Form 10-K.

Our independent registered public accounting firm is not required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our
internal control over financial reporting until the year ending December 31, 2021. At such time, our independent
registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the
level at which our internal control over financial reporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to
maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have an adverse effect
on our business and results of operations and could cause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.

We may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that
our platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results
of operations.

We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and
to enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain
and improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more
complex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers
attempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an
overwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not
return to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract
merchants, consumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that
we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our
technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business,
reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Defects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of
third-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

The software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some
of which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of
software updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform
may also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from
third-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue, and
access or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in
exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We
may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around
errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any
such errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We have expended and intend to expend substantial funds to satisfy a portion of our tax withholding and remittance
obligations that arise in connection with the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs, which may have an
adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We have also implemented “sell-to-cover” in
which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf of RSU holders upon vesting and/or
settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result in dilution to our stockholders.

We have expended and intend to expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance
obligations that arise upon the vesting and/or settlement of certain of our RSUs. Certain of our RSUs vested upon
the effectiveness of our IPO Registration Statement (the “IPO Vested RSUs”) and will settle approximately 180 days
following the effective date of our IPO Registration Statement under their terms (the “IPO Vested RSU Settlement
Date”). Under U.S. tax laws, the employment tax withholding and remittance obligations for the IPO Vested RSUs
arose in connection with their vesting, and the income tax withholding and remittance obligations will arise in
connection with their settlement on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date. On the initial vesting date for the IPO
Vested RSUs, we withheld shares and remitted tax withholding amounts on behalf of the holders of IPO Vested RSUs at
the applicable statutory rates for those IPO Vested RSU holders who elect to net share settle these tax withholding
obligations. Certain IPO Vested RSU holders elected to receive a short-term loan from us, with interest that will
accrue at the applicable federal rate to settle the tax withholding obligations arising in connection with the
vesting of the IPO Vested RSUs on the effectiveness of our IPO registration statement. The short-term loan extended
to employees totaled $10 million as of March 31, 2021. The balance of the loan is repayable from the proceeds of
sale of shares into the market on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date, which will result in dilution to our
stockholders.

To fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or
settlement of RSUs (including the income tax withholding and remittance obligations due with respect to the IPO
Vested RSUs on the IPO Vested RSU Settlement Date), we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock
that would otherwise be issued with respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash (which may
include cash generated from the proceeds of the IPO) to satisfy such tax obligations or (ii) have the holders of
such RSUs use a broker or brokers to sell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement
date, with the proceeds of such sales to be delivered to us for us to remit to the relevant taxing authorities, in
order to satisfy such tax withholding and remittance obligations. The tax withholding due in connection with such
RSU vesting and settlement will be based on the then-current value of the underlying shares of our Class A common
stock, and we would expect to withhold and remit the tax withholding liabilities at the applicable statutory rates
on behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash, which would result in significant cash
expenditures by us. In the three months ended March 31, 2021, we expended $166 million to satisfy tax withholding
and remittance obligations for certain RSUs vested during the period. If we implement “sell-to-cover” to satisfy
tax withholding obligations, shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation will be sold
on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash
proceeds from such sales will be remitted by us to the taxing authorities. Such sales will not result in the
expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the tax withholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution
to our stockholders.

We track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.
Certain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived
inaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.

We track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts and key business and non-
GAAP metrics such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross
Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, with internal systems and tools that
are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published
by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal
systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over
time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the
internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic
or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe
to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges
in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics
could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have
multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and
prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our
platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that
we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term
strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive
our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, we
expect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.

Operating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.
In addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.

As a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private
company. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations
of the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among
other things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and
results of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal
control over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to
increase our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public
company, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract
management, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a
result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition
will become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.

Many members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with
public company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our
management team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to
significant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous
scrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant
attention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our
business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Risks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment

If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results
of operations would be adversely affected.
                                                        64                                                         
Table of Contents
We are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and
other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification
of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an
independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and
regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to changes and
divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. As
referenced above, we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors. However, Dashers
may be reclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on service provider
classification and their potential impact on the local logistics industry. A reclassification of Dashers or other
delivery service providers as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations, including as a result of:

• monetary exposure arising from, or relating to failure to, withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and
hour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide
required breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including
related to the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act, or PAGA, and government fines;

• injunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;

• claims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;

• claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;

• claims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;

• other claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,
including risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and

• harm to our reputation and brand.

In addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service providers as
employees would require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability
to add and retain Dashers to our platform and grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on
our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher
classification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in
Dynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for
example, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled
pursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of
Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District
Attorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we
misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. This action is seeking both
restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as
independent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also sought a preliminary injunction that would have
barred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as independent contractors during the pendency of this
case. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn on December 8, 2020. We believe we have meritorious
defenses, despite the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In
addition, in 2017, we settled one classification matter in California on a class basis including claims raised
under PAGA and are in the process of settling a similar classification matter in California. See the section titled
“Legal Proceedings” for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.

An increasing number of jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in
Dynamex to determine worker classification. Further, the California Legislature passed AB 5 and it was signed into
law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the
Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs.
We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative Proposition
22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. As such, certain provisions
regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are now applicable to us and Dashers in California
and our costs related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we
will in certain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over
time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs could
also lead to a lower Take Rate, defined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The provisions
resulting from Proposition 22 that are now applicable to us include, but are not limited to, (i) net earnings
(which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other amounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings floor equal to (a)
120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged time and (b) for
                                                        65                                                         
Table of Contents
Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for inflation after 2021) and
(ii) for Dashers averaging at least 15 hours per week of engaged time during a calendar quarter who subscribe to a
qualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of varying dollar amounts depending on a
Dasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 is likely to have an adverse impact on our results of
operations. In addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation that
would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing
discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that
Dashers perform. To the extent other states adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in
such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge
higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Even
with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be
challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior Court
challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22 and similar challenges may also be filed. Furthermore, if
Dashers are determined to be employees in other states or under federal law, this could result in even higher
increases to our costs related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and commissions even more
and may result in further lower order volumes. To the extent Dashers are determined to be employees under other
state or federal law, we would be required to significantly alter our existing business model and operations, which
would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses
for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business.

We face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our
business generally, and with the food delivery services we facilitate in particular, including potential claims
related to food offerings, delivery, and quality.

We are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal,
regulatory, and other administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage,
worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer
complaints, intellectual property disputes, compliance with regulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may
become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and legal or regulatory
proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.

We are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the
actions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in
connection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents
caused by Dashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we
sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the
uncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we
face increasing public scrutiny. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic
beverages or alcohol consumption. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of,
any consumers, Dashers, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation,
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Reports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or
unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to potential legal
claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could do so in the
future as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that
generate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our business. The
potential for acts of terrorism on the U.S. or international food supply also exists and, if such an event occurs,
it could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through our platform could be
subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a food recall. In addition,
reports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation,
handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, could, as a result of
negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

We also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative
actions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our
platform as well as our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax,
service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including the background
check process, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email, text, or telephone. In
addition, we also face potential liability
                                                        66

and expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers relating to, among other things, our Dasher pay
model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and
gratuities, the local food delivery logistics services we facilitate, discrepancies between the menus on our
website and consumer mobile application and the menus at the restaurant from which the food is delivered, including
discrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and taxes on such items, and the nature and frequency of
our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or telephone. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings”
for additional information about these types of legal proceedings.

In addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our
website and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and
negligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security
incident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our
notification to affected consumers and Dashers.

The results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or
regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious
or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant
management attention, and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a
complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible
that a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and
penalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These
proceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or
other orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual
and other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial
partners and current and former directors and officers.

In addition, we include arbitration and class action waiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants,
consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation
process for all parties involved, as they can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in
state or federal court. However, arbitration can be costly and burdensome, and the use of arbitration and class
action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been
the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we may
limit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory
proceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit
certain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation
costs and exposure.

Further, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class
action waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal law, there is a risk that some or
all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised
to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in
part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate
disputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially
costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should
collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may
successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

The application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services
tax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the
fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the
Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax
obligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the
ultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our
business or to local logistics businesses generally.

In addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions
about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes
could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.

We are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the
United States, Canada, and Australia, and we may face various indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign
jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise
questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require
us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest,
and could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us
to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a
jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on
past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing
our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, even
where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately
calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally, if merchants try to pass along increased additional
taxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline. Although we have reserved for potential payments of
possible past tax liabilities in our financial statements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial
condition would be harmed.

Under state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain
states. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and could be applicable to the cost of
goods or fees charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use,
or other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past
sales and additional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our
platform. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Additionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional
reporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing
authorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,
collect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related
legislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. , certain states have enacted
laws that would require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting
or collection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. This new
legislation could require us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated
with tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less
attractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Also, federal tax rules generally require payors to report payments to unrelated parties to the IRS. Under certain
circumstances, a failure to comply with such reporting obligations may cause us to become liable to withhold a
percentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to
the large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these
reporting obligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy
such failures in a timely manner.

As a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts
recorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in
future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is
determined.

We may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.

We are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could
be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,
certain non-deductible expenses, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate
would reduce profitability or increase losses.

As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States or foreign
taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and
foreign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the
likelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no
assurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse
effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to employment taxes
and sales taxes are described in
                                                        68

more detail under “ —If Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial
condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.” and “—Taxing authorities may successfully assert
that we have not properly collected, or in the future should collect, sales and use, gross receipts, value added,
or similar taxes and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations,
or inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”

On December 22, 2017, the legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the Tax Act, was
enacted, which contains significant changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate and a
transition to a new territorial system of taxation. The primary impact of the new legislation on our provision for
income taxes was a reduction of the future tax benefits of our deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction in
the corporate tax rate. However, since we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets,
these changes did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The impact of the Tax Act
will likely be subject to ongoing technical guidance and accounting interpretation, which we will continue to
monitor and assess.

Our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.

As of December 31, 2020, we had accumulated $689 million and $547 million of federal and state net operating loss
carryforwards, or NOLs, respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to expire
in 2033 for federal and 2023 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in
time to use NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code
of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to
use its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income may
be limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5
percent stockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply
under state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes to reduce future taxable income and
liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes and ownership changes that
may occur in the future.

Under the Tax Act, as amended by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or the CARES Act, net
operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021 may be
carried back to each of the five taxable years preceding the tax year of such loss, but net operating losses
arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020 may not be carried back. Additionally, under the Tax
Act, as modified by the CARES Act, net operating losses from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 may
offset no more than 80% of current taxable income annually for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, but
the 80% limitation on the use of net operating losses from tax years that began after December 31, 2017 does not
apply for taxable income in tax years beginning before January 1, 2021. NOLs arising in tax years ending after
December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but NOLs generated in tax years ending before January 1,
2018 will continue to have a two-year carryback and twenty-year carryforward period. As we maintain a full
valuation allowance against our U.S. NOLs, these changes will not impact our balance sheet as of December 31, 2019.
However, in future years, if and when a net deferred tax asset is recognized related to our NOLs, the changes in
the carryforward and carryback periods as well as the new limitation on use of NOLs may significantly impact our
valuation allowance assessments for NOLs generated after December 31, 2019.

There is also a risk that due to regulatory changes, such as suspensions on the use of NOLs and tax credits by
certain jurisdictions, including in order to raise additional revenue to help counter the fiscal impact from the
COVID-19 pandemic, possibly with retroactive effect, or other unforeseen reasons, our existing NOLs and tax credits
could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities. A temporary suspension of the use
of certain NOLs and tax credits has been enacted in California, and other states may enact suspensions as well. For
these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and tax credits.

Our business is subject to a variety of U.S. laws and regulations, including those related to worker
classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and
failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our
business, financial condition, or results of operations.

The local delivery logistics industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are
subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to worker
classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as
worker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other highly
regulated products, online credit card payments, gratuities, pricing and commissions, text messaging, subscription
services, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data security, consumer protection, background checks,
website and mobile application accessibility, and tax are

often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and
interpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting,
including varying standards and interpretations between state and federal law, between individual states, and even
at the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time
through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies,
such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have been proactively working with state and local
governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform is available broadly in the United States and Canada.

Additionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their
users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion
of privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on
the nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,
regulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative
and regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business. It is also
likely that if our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, we
would become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how existing
laws would be applied to our business and the new laws to which it may become subject.

Recent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,
technology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and
administrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they
may view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to
our business, including by changing employment-related laws or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses
like ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in connection with the
COVID-19 pandemic, jurisdictions across the United States, including Massachusetts, Oregon, jurisdictions within
Los Angeles County, California, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., and New York, New York, have implemented temporary
price controls on local food delivery logistics platforms. In addition, there are legislative proposals to make
price controls on food delivery logistics platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be made. These
price controls have had in the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of
operations. These price controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge
to consumers, though we are aware of two jurisdictions which have adopted explicit limits or prohibitions against
doing so in connection with price controls, which could further increase our costs. With the continued duration of
COVID-19, we expect these existing price controls to persist in the near term and for additional jurisdictions
where we operate to implement similar price controls. If any of these events occur, or if price controls are
retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting
obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which creates additional challenges to managing our business.

Our success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses that perceive our
business model negatively to raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their
trade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant resources to shape the
legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to
change such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the
ability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply with these laws or
regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that
we may not be able to anticipate at this time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement
new measures to reduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to
discontinue certain services or platform features, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply
with applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings,
fines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement
actions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative
proposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred
to prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws
and regulations.

We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, and other
anticorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both
domestic and abroad. These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government
officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person, or gain any
improper advantage. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for
acts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are
acting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or
indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and
we may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and
intermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize
such activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and
compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address
compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of
our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, and our exposure for violating
these laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign
jurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money
laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of
significant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment
from U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or
overall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,
financial condition, and results of operations.

Government regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could
substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws
specifically governing the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and
future laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce,
or other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business
practices, or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue
to evolve, may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content,
copyrights, distribution, social media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts
and other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and
quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and
other taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to
expand internationally, it is possible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our
mobile applications or website or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and website. Any
failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our
reputation and brand, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others,
which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,
or any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating
to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.

We receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personally identifiable information and other data relating to
the users on our platform, as well as other personally identifiable information and other data relating to
individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and international laws and
regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types
of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic
Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law,
Australia’s Privacy Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, or the TCPA, Section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act, and effective as of January 1, 2020, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA. These laws,
rules, and regulations evolve frequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation,
amendments to existing legislation, and changes in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to
another. For example, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires new
disclosures to California consumers and affords such consumers new abilities to opt out of certain sales of
personal information. The CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation. Aspects of the CCPA and its
interpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching
                                                        71                                                         
Table of Contents
and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related
costs and expenses. The CCPA has been amended on multiple occasions, and it is unclear whether it will be further
amended. For example, a ballot initiative in California in November 2020 titled the California Privacy Rights Act,
or CPRA, was approved by California voters and significantly modified the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty
and likely requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA creates obligations
relating to consumer data beginning on January 1, 2022, with implementing regulations expected on or before July 1,
2022, and enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. We will continue to monitor developments related to the CPRA. The
effects of this legislation potentially are far-reaching, however, and may require us to modify our data processing
practices and policies and incur substantial compliance-related costs and expenses. Additionally, many laws and
regulations relating to privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain
types of data are subject to varying degrees of enforcement and new and changing interpretations by courts. The
CCPA and other changes in laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection, and information security,
particularly any new or modified laws or regulations, or changes to the interpretation or enforcement of such laws
or regulations, that require enhanced protection of certain types of data or new obligations with regard to data
retention, transfer, or disclosure, could greatly increase the cost of providing our platform, require significant
changes to our operations, or even prevent us from providing our platform in jurisdictions in which we currently
operate and in which we may operate in the future.

Additionally, we have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with
privacy, data protection, and information security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry
standards, or contractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA and CPRA imposing
new and relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application
of these and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making
necessary changes to our policies and practices and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.

Despite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data
protection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or platform
could be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or
obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our third-party providers or merchants on our platform, to comply with
applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information
security, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personally
identifiable information or other data relating to Dashers, consumers, or other individuals, or the perception that
any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and
existing Dashers and consumers from using our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by
governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business,
financial condition, and results of operations. Even if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy
concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

We face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone
Consumer Protection Act.

The actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities
or claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of
automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil
claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text
messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we
become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business, financial
condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

Our reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.

GAAP is subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC, and various bodies
formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or
interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and could affect the
reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in May 2014, the FASB issued
Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers (Topic 606),” or ASC 606,
which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No.
2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” or ASC 842, which increases lease transparency and comparability among
organizations. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting
policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.
                                                                                                                   
  Risks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties

We rely primarily on third-party insurance policies to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance
coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their
obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our
business, financial condition, and results of operations.

We procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including auto liability,
employment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches,
crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business
liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving
services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough
insurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services,
and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain.
Additionally, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related
claims that we make. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of
insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of
these merchant agreements.

If the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we
would bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured
retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles
for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or
we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our
business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim,
premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we
experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance
claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of claims under our
deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.

We primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made by consumers and payments made to
merchants and Dashers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third party and other payment-related
risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made by consumers and payments
made to merchants and Dashers. Under our commercial agreement with Stripe, Stripe may terminate the relationship
with advanced notice. If Stripe terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on
commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to
secure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and
services provided by Stripe may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be
compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments
or other payment transactions or make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our
business for an extended period of time, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, and adversely
affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.

Nearly all payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment services,
which subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options
to consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws
and regulations relating to the payments we accept from our consumers, including with respect to money laundering,
money transfers, privacy, and information security. If we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable
regulations, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or
criminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other
payment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely
on data provided by Stripe for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in
such data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could
be adversely affected.

Further, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable law, we could become subject to
certain laws, rules, and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and
numerous state and local agencies that may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may
have a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we
could be subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial
services, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations governing our business that we are
subject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we
are not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more
jurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators. In addition to
                                                        73                                                         
Table of Contents
fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil
proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make
changes to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.

Additionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating
rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new
operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain
services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or
regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit
card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition,
and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment
processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these
rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or
interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and
results of operations.

We currently host our platform and support our operations on a single datacenter provided by Amazon Web Services,
or AWS, a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the
facilities of AWS that we use. AWS’ facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters,
cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s
continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the
future we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to
a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and
capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the
requirements of users on our platform. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to
our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform. It may become
increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand
and the usage of our platform increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our
reputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform. Any of the above circumstances or events
may harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short-
term loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely
affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Our commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the
agreement for convenience by providing us at least 30 days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the agreement
for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure
period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice. Even though our
platform is entirely in the cloud, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud
infrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated
or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime for a
short period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers.
However, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers
would cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations over the longer term.

We rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide
accurate information or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

Where permitted under applicable law, we rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal
and/or driving records of potential Dashers to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform
pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such
providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable law or
regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to
renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may
not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable timeframe. In certain jurisdictions,
including the United States, we rely on a single third-party background check provider for these jurisdictions. If
we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to
timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential Dashers and we
may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background checks conducted by
our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our expectations, unqualified
Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we may be unable to adequately
protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified Dashers may be inadvertently
excluded from our platform. For example, we had a Dasher who had a criminal conviction that should have excluded
him from using our platform who was nonetheless cleared by one of our background check providers, and as a result,
we allowed him to make deliveries on our platform and he was subsequently alleged to cause personal injury to a
merchant on our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely
affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages
in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such
criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our platform. In addition, if
the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet the requirements under
applicable laws and regulations, we could face legal liability or negative publicity.

We are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing
Dashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with
applicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations
could be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative
actions. For example, we have faced non-material issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related
to notice requirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be
limited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail
to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of
eligibility.

In jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we
decide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By
choosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or
regulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative
publicity or become subject to litigation in the future.

Any negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to
safety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could
adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation
exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations.

We rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the
distribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.

We rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the
mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all
mapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping
functions may not be reliable. From time to time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of
our third party software providers. If, in connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its
relationship with us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our
platform could be disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software
that we and Dashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software
on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such
software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or
inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.

We depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not
control.

We have integrations with Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio, Wavefront, Snowflake, Olo, third-party offerings such as
Google Maps and AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party applications, products, and services are
constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with
third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our
platform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or
exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.
As our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we face to increase. Should any of our
competitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that
degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives
preferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our platform, business, financial condition, and
results of operations could be adversely affected.

We rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,
consumers, and Dashers. If we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such
application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that reduce
the effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial
results, and results of operations could be adversely affected.

We depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application
marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. Any
changes in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our applications or give
preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile
devices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our
applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our
applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify
their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such
mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our applications, our
user growth could slow. Our applications have experienced fluctuations in the past, and we anticipate similar
fluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

As new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will
continue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our applications. Additionally, in order to
deliver high-quality applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range
of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining
relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’ experience. If merchants, consumers,
or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile
devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our user growth
and user engagement would be adversely affected.

In addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as
well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about
users of our platform, including merchants, consumers and Dashers. For example, Apple made certain changes to its
products and data use policies in connection with the release of its iOS 14 operating system. We expect that these
changes will
                                                        76

negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions because they will limit our visibility into
the performance of specific advertising channels. If we are unable to mitigate the effects of these developments,
we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates from existing consumers on our
platform, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Internet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new consumer growth could decline and our business,
financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected if we fail to appear prominently in
search results.

Our success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search
engines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is
due in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a
number of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search
engine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may
not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to
influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes
their own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search
engines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher
advertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Our website has experienced
fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any
reduction in the number of consumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Certain estimates and information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on information from

  Risks Related to our Intellectual Property                                                                       
                                                                                                                   
Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,
and results of operations.

Our business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our
business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual
restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,
technology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual
property on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we
share information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent
unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not
provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or
technology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,
unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain
and use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or
successfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through
various methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be
inadequate.

We have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other
jurisdictions. Competitors have and may continue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our
ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade
name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks.
Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and
administrative bodies in the United States and abroad

may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope
of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or register our
trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our
proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could
adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Intellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely
affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.

We operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the
future may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay
substantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.

For example, in 2020 we received a letter from International Business Machines Corporation, or IBM, alleging that
we infringe on at least five U.S. patents held by IBM, and inviting us to negotiate a business resolution of the
allegations. To date, no litigation has been filed by IBM against us regarding the IBM patents. Based upon our
preliminary review of these patents, we believe we have meritorious defenses to IBM’s allegations, although there
can be no assurance that we will be successful in defending against these allegations or reaching a business
resolution that is satisfactory to us.

Further, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising
from such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of
operations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit
or are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management
personnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble
damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease
making, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend
additional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or
license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if
required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license
intellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do
not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and
resources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and
results of operations.

We may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from
acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,
trademarks, or service marks.

We have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com.
If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable
registration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could
cause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in
question. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of
reasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using
domain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that
infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.
Protecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in
substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial
condition, and results of operations.

Our platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the
underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.

Our platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and
distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open
source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections
regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may
make it easier for others to compromise our platform.

Some open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or
modified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the
licensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that
source code available at
                                                        78

little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software
with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release
the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software license. This could enable
our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a
loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the release of the affected portions of our source
code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and resources to re-engineer
some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software until we can adequately
address the concerns.

Although we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are
designed to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be
effective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not
been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way
that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.
From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that
incorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties
claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to
fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or
other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on
terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our
platform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source
code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results
of operations.
                                                                                                                   
   Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity                                                                 
                                                                                                                   
We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable
terms, if at all.

Historically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our
operations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue
to make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business
growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new
platform features and services or enhance our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire
complementary businesses and technologies. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital
and capital expenditure needs for at least the next 12 months, we may require additional financing. Accordingly, we
may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through
future issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders
could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges
superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time,
and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans,
and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be
able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate
financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our
business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and
results of operations may be adversely affected.

Our revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our
operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.

The terms of our revolving credit facility includes a number of covenants that limit our ability and our
subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with
other companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,
make investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving
credit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance
our future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for
us to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies
which are not subject to such restrictions.

A failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result
in an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments
to provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together
with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving
credit facility were to be

accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell
sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of
operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially
reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of March 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding
under the revolving credit facility.

Risks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock

The multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders has the effect of
concentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of
directors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for
approval, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of
incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our
assets, or other major corporate transaction.

Our Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C
common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the
issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of March 31, 2021, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief
Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering,
and a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of
our board of directors collectively held 68% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate,
which voting power may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards
(including those equity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to the IPO and subject to equity exchange right
agreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any shares
of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or the
vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of
Class B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had
been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of March 31, 2021, our Co-Founders
would collectively hold 79% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-Founders have also entered
into the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and
vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and
permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will
be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including
the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,
and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major
corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you
disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,
preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to
receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market
price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause
conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in our Mr. Xu
undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or the Co-Founders but would
not be desirable for our other stockholders.

Future transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically
converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected
for estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of
Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by
our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the
number of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common
stock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.
Xu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu
and his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our IPO, which we sometimes refer to
herein as the 35% Ownership Threshold; (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr. Xu,
during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person
designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors(or if there is no such person, then our secretary then
in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days
following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation): or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180
days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or
consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary
resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu
                                                        80                                                         
Table of Contents
not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of
all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation occurs as the Final Conversion Date.

We have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per
share (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further
strategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.
Over time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders
and this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of
our total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting
power, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the
outcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock have no
voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution,
which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to
Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class
C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met.
As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our
voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted
to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our Co-Founders and,
in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their
holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will
not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock
Exchange.

Although we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York
Stock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail
ourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.

As a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement between the Co-Founders, our Co-
Founders collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2020,
and Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common
stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his
discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as
that term is set forth in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a
company in which over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or
another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New
York Stock Exchange regarding corporate governance, including:

• the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;

• the requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent
directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance
evaluation of the committee; and

• the requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written
charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,
and the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal
counsel, or any other advisor retained by the committee.

These requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled
company” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these
exemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the
New York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with
certain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the
protections for other stockholders.

We cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.
Future issuances of our Class C common stock, if any, will not dilute the voting control of Mr. Xu, but will dilute
his economic interest which could cause his interests to conflict with your interests. Further, the issuance of
shares of Class C common stock, whether to Mr. Xu or to other stockholders, could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s
voting control.

We cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our
Class A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers
have announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.
In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater
than 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it
will no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices
include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P
Composite 1500. Also in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment
of no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices
and in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in
its indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under
such announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain
indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to track
those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear
what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but
it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Given the
sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from
certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common
stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be
adversely affected.

The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.

The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to
various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of
your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our
Class A common stock include the following:

• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;

• volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;

• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in
our industry in particular;

• sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;

• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts
who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;

• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet
those projections;

• announcements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;

• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;

• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;

• actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;

• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape
generally;

• litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of
our competitors;

• actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;

• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;

• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;

• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;

• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;

• any significant change in our management;

• general economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and
                                                        82

• other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public
health concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.

In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a
particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these
companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our
management’s attention and resources.

A substantial portion of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock are restricted
from immediate resale, but may be sold on a stock exchange in the near future. The large number of shares eligible
for public sale or subject to rights requiring us to register them for public sale could depress the market price
of our Class A common stock.

The market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our
Class A common stock in the market in the near future, and the perception that these sales could occur may also
depress the market price of our Class A common stock.

Our executive officers, directors, and the holders of substantially all of our capital stock and securities
convertible into or exchangeable for our capital stock have entered into market standoff agreements with us or have
entered into lock-up agreements with the underwriters of our IPO under which they have agreed, subject to specific
exceptions, not to sell any of our stock for a period of time up to 180 days following the date of our final
prospectus relating to our IPO, dated December 8, 2020 and filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act,
or our Prospectus. We refer to such period as the lock-up period.

Our lock-up period has two potential release dates, the first following our first earnings release or periodic
report (either our quarterly report on Form 10-Q or annual report on Form 10-K), which was determined to be March
9, 2021, as described below, and the second following our second earnings release or periodic report, or 180 days,
whichever is earlier.

On March 1, 2021 the underwriters of our IPO agreed that the restricted period under the lock-up agreement will end
with respect to 40% of the shares subject to each lock-up agreement (or 20% of the shares if the stockholder is a
member of the Company’s board of directors (excluding affiliated funds) or management team) and become eligible for
sale in the public market at the open of trading on March 9, 2021 (the "Early Lock-Up Expiration Date").

All remaining shares of common stock subject to the lock-up agreement and not released on the Early Lock-Up
Expiration Date will be released upon the earlier of (i) immediately prior to the opening of trading on the third
full trading day after we have publicly furnished our second earnings release on Form 8-K or filed our second
periodic report with the SEC or (ii) 180 days after the Effective Date, or the Final Lock-Up Expiration Date. We
will announce the Final Lock-Up Expiration Date through a press release or Form 8-K at least two full trading days
before it is effective. We and the underwriters may release certain stockholders from the market standoff
agreements or lock-up agreements prior to the end of the lock-up period.

Sales of our Class A common stock as restrictions end or pursuant to registration rights may make it more difficult
for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could
also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares
of our Class A common stock.

Delaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated
bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our
Class A common stock.

Our status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may
discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an
interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an
interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may
make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:

• any amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a
majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;
                                                        83                                                         
Table of Contents
• our amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power
of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required
for stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;

• our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to
determine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own
significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and
Class C common stock;

• our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and
directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;

• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority
of the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock, or the Voting
Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first
recommended or approved by our board of directors;

• after the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders
and will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;

• vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by
stockholders;

• a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief
Executive Officer, our President, or a majority of our board of directors;

• certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;

• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which
may be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and

• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring
matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.

These provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in
control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for
stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any
of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for
their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay
for our Class A common stock.

Our amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the
exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’
ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.

Our amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or
proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of
our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any
provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our
amended and restated bylaws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs
doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have
jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having
jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the
federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint
asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. Nothing in our
amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such
claims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.

Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to
have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s
ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or
other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The
enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in
legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or
unenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a
provision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive
                                                        84                                                         
Table of Contents
forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable.
Although this decision was reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still
find these provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions
in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs
associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of
operations.

If securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,
our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,
the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.

The trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or
industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based
upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who
cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative
recommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price
of our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of
these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the
financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of
our Class A common stock to decline.

We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.

We have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future
earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any
dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility
contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class
A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on
their investment.
