On February 11, 2025, DoorDash posted supplemental investor materials on the investor relations section of its
website (ir.doordash.com). DoorDash announces material information to the public about DoorDash, its products and

(ir.doordash.com), its blog (doordash.news) and its X account (@DoorDash) in order to achieve broad, non-
exclusionary distribution of information to the public and for complying with its disclosure obligations under
Regulation FD.

The information in Item 2.02 and Item 7.01 of this Current Report on Form 8-K, and Exhibit 99.1 and Exhibit 99.2
attached hereto, shall not be deemed “filed” for purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as

On February 11, 2025, DoorDash announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of
shares of its Class A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $5.0 billion, which is inclusive of the
remaining share repurchase authority of $876 million under the share repurchase program that was previously
announced by DoorDash in February 2024. The Company’s board of directors expects to assess any future repurchase
programs based on its balance sheet, expected free cash flow, and alternative investment opportunities at the time.
Any future authorization will be approved and executed consistent with the Company’s capital allocation strategy.

Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market repurchases or through privately negotiated
transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other relevant factors. Open market
repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act.
DoorDash may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its Class A common
stock under this authorization. DoorDash may or may not repurchase any portion of the total authorized amount, and
the timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general
business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.
