Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DoorDash, Inc., its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries and entities consolidated under the variable interest entity model, and have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and\nthe requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim reporting. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that\nare, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. They should be\nread in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results for a full year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make\ncertain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\nrelated disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances\nfor credit losses, gift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and\nwebsite development costs, intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and\nother financial instruments including valuation of investments without readily determinable fair values, valuation\nof acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, insurance\nreserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\n11\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies from its Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomprised of the Company's Marketplaces and Platform Services.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of the Company's\nmembership products, the address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2022        2023\nUnited States    $                         1,445    $  1,846\nInternational                                 11         189\nTotal revenue    $                         1,456    $  2,035\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from\nconsumers and merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized\nover time. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2023 was as\nfollows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31, 2023\nBeginning balance                          $                                251\nAddition to contract liabilities                                            524\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                                    -546\nEnding balance                             $                                229\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 129million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, of which $ 70million was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31,\n2023. The ending balance of unearned prepayments is expected to be recognized as revenue in 12 months or less.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance\nsheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing\nexpense and amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of\nrevenue, exclusive of depreciation and\n12\nTable of Contents\namortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. A summary of activities related to deferred\ncontract costs was as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2022       2023\nBeginning balance                          $                            62    $   100\nAddition to deferred contract costs                                     13         17\nAmortization of deferred contract costs                                 -6        -10\nEnding balance                             $                            69    $   107\nDeferred contract costs, current           $                            27    $    39\nDeferred contract costs, non-current                                    42         68\nTotal deferred contract costs              $                            69    $   107\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable and changes were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2022       2023\nBeginning balance                           $                            39    $    20\nAdditions to the provision for expected                                   2          —\ncredit losses\nWrite-offs charged against the allowance                                 -4         -3\nEnding balance                              $                            37    $    17\n4. Acquisitions\nWolt Acquisition\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of 100percent of the outstanding equity interests of Wolt\nEnterprise Oy (“Wolt”). The Company's aim is to accelerate its product development, increase its international\nscale, bring greater focus to its markets outside the United States, and improve the value provided to consumers,\nmerchants, as well as Dashers around the world. The Company’s acquisition-related costs were $ 48million and all\ncosts were recorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of\noperations during the period in which they were incurred. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration\ntransferred for Wolt was $ 2,838million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nDoorDash Class A common stock                         $       2,705\nStock-based compensation awards (DoorDash options,\nrestricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), and revesting                  133\ncommon stock) attributable to pre-combination\nservices\nTotal consideration                                   $       2,838\nThe fair value of 36million shares of Class A common stock issued was determined on the basis of the closing market\nprice of the Company’s Class A common stock on the acquisition date. The Company also issued certain stock-based\ncompensation awards and their fair value was determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model with the\napplicable assumptions as of the acquisition date for options ( 1.7million DoorDash options) and using the closing\nmarket price of the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date for RSUs ( 1.4million DoorDash RSUs).\nFor certain Wolt employees, a portion of their total consideration transferred was restricted subject to revesting\nover a service period, including 568thousand shares of the Company's Class A common stock. This restricted equity\nconsideration is considered compensation for post-combination services and will be recognized as stock-based\ncompensation expense over the next four years, based on the fair value of the shares using the closing market price\nof the Company's Class A common stock on the acquisition date.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe total purchase consideration of the Wolt acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The\nCompany recorded $ 1,997million of goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net assets\nacquired. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of Wolt and anticipated synergies from the\nfuture growth and strategic advantages in the global local commerce industry. The goodwill recorded in connection\nwith the acquisition of Wolt is not deductible for tax purposes. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, and are considered preliminary and subject to\nchange within the measurement period, including potential adjustments to sales tax balances and other liabilities,\nas additional information is received. The Company expects to finalize the allocation of the purchase price as soon\nas practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date when the measurement period ends.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the\nacquisition date (in millions):\nMay 31, 2022\nCurrent assets                   $           272\nIntangible assets                            772\nGoodwill                                   1,997\nOther non-current assets                      82\nCurrent liabilities                         -204\nDeferred tax liability, net                  -34\nOther non-current liabilities                -47\nTotal purchase price             $         2,838\nThe following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their estimated\nuseful life as of the date of acquisition (in years):\nEstimated Useful\nLife       May 31, 2022\nMerchant relationships                            11    $           236\nTrademark                                         10                268\nExisting technology                                6                150\nCustomer relationships                             3                107\nCourier relationships                              1                 11\nTotal acquired intangible assets                        $           772\nExisting technology represents the existing online and mobile Wolt platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and\npickup orders. The merchant, customer, and courier relationships represent the fair value of the underlying\nrelationships with merchants, such as restaurants and grocery stores, users of Wolt’s food and delivery services,\nand courier partners. The estimated fair values of the existing technology and trademarks were determined using a\nrelief from royalty method. The fair values of the merchant, courier and customer relationships were determined\nusing a replacement cost method. The Company expects to amortize the fair value of these intangible assets on a\nstraight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.\nBbot Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired Bbot, Inc., a hospitality technology company. The addition of Bbot's\nproducts and technology to the Company's platform will offer merchants more solutions for their in-store and online\nchannels, including in-store digital ordering and payments. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition\nmethod of accounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $ 88million in cash, including a $\n9million indemnification holdback, which was recorded in other liabilities.\nThe total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities\nassumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the anticipated\nsynergies from the future growth opportunities from the adoption of Bbot’s technology by the Company’s merchants.\nThe fair value of assets\n14\nTable of Contents\nacquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions, including a valuation\nfrom an independent third-party valuation firm.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMarch 1, 2022\nCurrent assets          $             11\nIntangible assets                     18\nGoodwill                              60\nOther liabilities                     -1\nTotal purchase price    $             88\nThe intangible assets acquired consisted of existing technology and customer relationships, which had estimated\nremaining useful lives of 5and 3years as of the date of the acquisition, respectively.\nThe acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\n5.

The fair value of the Company’s Level 2 fixed income securities is obtained from\nindependent pricing services, which may use quoted market prices for identical or comparable instruments in less\nactive markets or model driven valuations using observable market data or inputs corroborated by observable market\ndata.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes in a same or\nsimilar security from the same issuer occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable\ntransaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs.\nThe Company's investments in non-marketable equity securities were accounted for using the measurement alternative,\nwhere the Company adjusts the value of the investments based on changes in value due to observable price changes\nfor identical or similar securities of the investee or impairment. In the three months ended March 31, 2022 and\n2023, the Company did not record any material upward or downward adjustments or impairments on its non-marketable\nequity securities.\nEstimating the fair value of the Company’s investments in non-marketable equity securities requires the use of\nestimates and judgments.

Construction in progress primarily included leasehold improvements on premises\nthat are not ready for use and equipment for merchants that are not placed in service.\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following (in millions):\nDecember 31,       March 31,\n2022            2023\nLitigation reserves                        $            37    $         40\nSales tax payable and accrued sales and                194             227\nindirect taxes\nAccrued operations related expenses                    220             230\nAccrued advertising                                    124             138\nDasher and merchant payable                            702             717\nInsurance reserves                                     418             489\nContract liabilities                                   251             229\nOther                                                  386             318\nTotal                                      $         2,332    $      2,388\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,\nand such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex\nOperations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”). The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that\nwas signed into law\n19\nTable of Contents\nin September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased legal proceedings and\nrelated expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business model and operations.\nFurther, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to\ndetermine worker classification.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nconducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the\nclassification and compensation of Dashers, the DoorDash Dasher pay model, and other matters. For example, the\nCompany is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of California (the “CA EDD”) for\npayroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued an assessment for certain amounts that it found to be\nowed by the Company on behalf of Dashers due to their being classified as independent contractors. The Company\nbelieves that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors. Accordingly, the Company\nbelieves that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously appeal such adverse assessment. Results of\naudits and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an\naudit having a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations and the\ndetermination of a final assessment amount, and any related penalties, cannot currently be predicted with certainty\nbut a loss at this time is not probable or estimable.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to\nemployees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other\nallegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the\nCompany from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these\nindemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the\nindividual.\nNoliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provided for a $\n300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. In August 2020, the Company amended\nand restated the revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide for $ 100million of incremental revolving loan\ncommitments, effective upon consummation of the Company's initial public offering (the \"IPO\"), for total revolving\ncommitments of $ 400million. The amendment and restatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit\nfacility from November 19, 2024 to August 7, 2025. As further amended on October 31, 2022, loans under the credit\nfacility bear interest at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted\nSOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of\none, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees\nfor a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused\ncommitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants, such as financial statement\nreporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as customary negative covenants that\nrestrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur\nliens, declare cash dividends or make certain other distributions, merge or\n20\nTable of Contents\nconsolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and acquisitions,\nand engage in transactions with affiliates.\nAs of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit\nagreement. As of December 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, noamounts were drawn from the credit facility.\nThe Company maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, the Company had $ 132million and $ 133million of issued letters of credit\noutstanding, respectively, of which $ 99million and $ 99million, respectively, were issued from the revolving\ncredit and guaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state, local, and foreign tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect\ntax matters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves when they become probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may\ndiffer from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will\nreceive additional assessments by various tax authorities in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments could\nresult in changes to the Company's reserves related to positions on sales and indirect tax filings.\n9. Common Stock\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2023, the Company authorized the repurchase of shares of Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount\nof up to $ 750million. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company repurchased 6.8million shares of\nits Class A common stock at a weighted average price of $ 58.03per share for a total amount of $ 392million. The\nshares were retired immediately upon repurchase.\nRestricted Stock\nIn 2022, the Company granted restricted stock to certain continuing employees in connection with the Wolt\nacquisition. Vesting of this stock is dependent on the respective employee’s continued employment at the Company\nduring the requisite service period, which is generally up to four yearsfrom the issuance date. The fair value of\nthe restricted stock issued to employees that is subject to post-acquisition employment is recorded as compensation\nexpense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe activities for the restricted stock issued to employees was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nWeighted-\nNumber of                    Average\nUnvested restricted stock as of December       Shares                 Grant Date\n31, 2022                                          472       Fair Value Per Share\nGranted                                             —    $                     —\nVested                                            -47    $                 76.91\nForfeited                                           —    $                     —\nUnvested restricted stock as of March             425\n31, 2023\n21\nTable of Contents\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of s tock option activity under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, 2020 Equity Incentive Plan and 2022\nInducement Equity Incentive Plan was as follows (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in\nthousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                          Average\nShares             Weighted-    Remaining\nsubject to               Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nOptions              Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nOutstanding       Price Per Share    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December 31,                    16,021    $             2.84                 3.48    $        737\n2022\nGranted                                            —    $                —\nExercised                                     -1,724    $             1.12                         $         98\nCancelled and forfeited                            —    $                —\nBalance as of March 31, 2023                  14,297    $             3.05                 3.28    $        865\nExercisable as of March 31,                   13,995    $             3.03                 3.27    $        847\n2023\nVested and expected to vest\nas of March                                   14,297    $             3.05                 3.28    $        865\n31, 2023\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock on the New York Stock Exchange\n(the \"NYSE\") as of the respective period-end dates.

The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service\ncondition and achievement of certain stock price goals. As of March 31, 2023, unrecognized stock-based compensation\nexpense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 150million, which is expected to be recognized over a period of\n2.07years.\nAs of March 31, 2023, there was $ 2.2billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested\nrestricted stock and RSUs, excluding the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the CEO\nPerformance Award. The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average period of\n2.83years.\n10. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate,\nadjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate\nof the annual effective tax rate and, if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a\ncumulative adjustment to tax expense or benefit in the period.\nThe Company recorded zeroand $ 17million of provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2022\nand 2023, respectively.\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance\nif it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. The\nCompany evaluates and weighs all available evidence, both positive and negative, including its historic operating\nresults, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, as well as projected future taxable income. The\nCompany will continue to regularly assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Changes in earnings\nperformance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause the Company to adjust the valuation\nallowance on deferred tax assets, which could materially impact the income tax expense in the period the Company\ndetermines that these factors have changed. As of March 31, 2023, the Company maintains a full valuation allowance\non its deferred tax assets except for certain foreign jurisdictions.\nAs of March 31, 2023, the Company had $ 75million of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, the majority of\nwhich would result in adjustments to the valuation allowance. The Company is subject to income tax audits in the\nUnited States and foreign jurisdictions. The Company recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and\nbelieves that the Company has provided adequate reserves for income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. To the\nextent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in which the attribute was generated may still be\nadjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to the extent utilized in a future\nperiod.\n11. Net Loss per Share Attributable to DoorDash, Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders using the two-class\nmethod required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the\nliquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than\nvoting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net\nlosses.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to DoorDash,\nInc. common stockholders during the periods presented. RSUs that vested but have not been settled are included in\nthe denominator in\n23\nTable of Contents\ncalculating net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2023 (in millions, except share amounts which\nare reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2022                        2023\nClass A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nNet loss including redeemable         $                          -152    $      -15    $     -150    $      -12\nnon-controlling interests\nLess: Net loss attributable to\nredeemable non-controlling                                          —             —            -1             —\ninterests\nNet loss attributable to DoorDash,\nInc.                                  $                          -152    $      -15    $     -149    $      -12\ncommon stockholders\nWeighted-average number of shares\noutstanding used to compute net\nloss per\nshare attributable to DoorDash,                               318,086        31,133       362,406        27,991\nInc.\ncommon stockholders, basic and\ndiluted\nNet loss per share attributable to\nDoorDash, Inc. common                 $                         -0.48    $    -0.48    $    -0.41    $    -0.41\nstockholders,\nbasic and diluted\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is\ncontingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied at the end of the respective\nperiods (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2022      2023\nStock options to purchase common stock               16,425    14,297\nUnvested restricted stock and restricted             27,422    40,635\nstock units\nEscrow shares                                             —     2,012\nTotal                                                43,847    56,944\n12. Restructuring\nOn November 30, 2022, the Company committed to a reduction in workforce (the “Plan”) intended to better align the\nCompany’s talent with its strategic priorities and to improve operating efficiency. The Plan included the\nelimination of approximately 1,250positions across the Company, or approximately 7% of the Company’s current\nemployee workforce at such time.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recognized an additional $ 2million in connection with\nthe Plan, primarily consisting of separation-related payments and other termination benefit costs. These expenses\nare included in restructuring charges in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company made cash payments amounting to $ 49million in connection\nwith the Plan. As of March 31, 2023, the liabilities related to the Plan were immaterial.\nThe Company expects that cash payments and expenses related to the Plan will be completed by the end of the second\nquarter of 2023.\n13. Subsequent Events\nIn April 2023, the Company repurchased an additional 1.7million shares of its Class A common stock at a weighted\naverage price of $ 61.68per share for a total amount of $ 108million. The shares were retired immediately upon\nrepurchase.\n24\nTable of Contents",

As part of our\nMarketplaces, we also offer Pickup, which allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their\norders conveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on our platform\nwith large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The DoorDash Marketplace also includes\nDashPass and the Wolt Marketplace includes Wolt+. DashPass and Wolt+ are our membership products, which provide\nmembers with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees on eligible\norders.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer Platform Services, which primarily includes DoorDash Drive and Wolt\nDrive, which are white-label delivery fulfillment services that enable merchants that have generated consumer\ndemand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our platform. Platform Services also includes\nDoorDash Storefront, which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them\nwith a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering\nor fulfillment capabilities, and Bbot, which offers merchants solutions for their in-store and online channels,\nincluding in-store digital ordering and payments.\n25\nTable of Contents\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nWe use the following financial and operational metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting\nour business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions, except percentages)                                     2022            2023\nTotal Orders                                                           404             512\nTotal Orders Y/Y growth                                                 23  %           27  %\nMarketplace GOV                            $                        12,353       $  15,913\nMarketplace GOV Y/Y growth                                              25  %           29  %\nRevenue                                    $                         1,456       $   2,035\nRevenue Y/Y growth                                                      35  %           40  %\nNet Revenue Margin                                                    11.8  %         12.8  %\nGAAP Gross Profit                          $                           662       $     921\nGAAP Gross Profit as a % of Marketplace                                5.4  %          5.8  %\nGOV\nContribution Profit(1)                     $                           319       $     533\nContribution Profit as a % of                                          2.6  %          3.3  %\nMarketplace GOV\nGAAP Net Loss including redeemable         $                          -167       $    -162\nnon-controlling interests\nGAAP Net Loss including redeemable\nnon-controlling interests as a % of                                   -1.4  %         -1.0  %\nMarketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                         $                            54       $     204\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                                  0.4  %          1.3  %\nGOV\nBasic shares, options and RSUs                                         395             444\noutstanding as of period end\n(1) Contribution Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information regarding our use\nof these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed through our Marketplaces and Platform Services\nbusinesses over the period of measurement.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Total Orders increased to 512 million, or 27% growth compared to the same quarter of\n2022. The increase in Total Orders was driven primarily by growth in consumers and increased consumer engagement as\nwell as our acquisition of Wolt .\nMarketplace GOV. We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplaces,\nincluding taxes, tips, and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass and Wolt+.\nMarketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does not include\nthe dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through Drive ,\nStorefront , or Bbot.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Marketplace GOV increased to $15.9 billion, or 29% growth compared to the same\nquarter of 2022, driven primarily by organic growth in Total Orders as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\nContribution Profit (Loss). We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and\nmarketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,\n(iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off\nrelated to restructuring. Gross profit (loss) is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of\ndepreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Contribution Profit increased to $533 million, compared to $319 million in the same\nquarter of 2022, driven primarily by growth in Marketplace GOV, an increase in Net Revenue Margin, defined as\nrevenue expressed\n26\nTable of Contents\nas a percentage of Marketplace GOV, and leverage on sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase\nin cost of revenue.\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It\ndoes not reflect our financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United\nStates (\"GAAP\") as it does not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss) is not indicative of our overall\nresults or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is not a financial measure of total\ncompany profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total company profitability nor does it\nimply profitability for our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests,\nadjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on\ndisposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition,\nintegration, and investment related costs), (iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory\nwrite-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest (income)\nexpense, net, (ix) other (income) expense, net, (x) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax\nexpense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a per formance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating\nleverage in our business.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $204 million from $54 million in the same quarter of\n2022, driven by growth in Contribution Profit.\nFree Cash Flow. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and\nequipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nIn the first quarter of 2023, Free Cash Flow increased to $316 million, compared to negative Free Cash Flow of $91\nmillion in the same quarter of 2022, driven primarily by changes in operating assets and liabilities.\n27\nTable of

Marketplaces and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our\nMarketplaces to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our Marketplaces to\narrange for delivery services. We recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an agent for\nboth partner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects commissions charged to partner merchants and\nfees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which includes certain\ndiscounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer. Revenue from our\nMarketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part\nof our Marketplaces revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable\nbasis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership\npurchased by the consumer.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Platform Services, which primarily consists\nof our Drive and Storefront offerings. We generate revenue from Drive by collecting per-order fees from merchants\nto arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is\nrecognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions, except percentages)                               2022        2023    % Change\nRevenue                              $                         1,456    $  2,035          40  %\nRevenue in creased by $579 million, or 40%, during the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same quarter of 2022.\nThe increase was primarily driven by a 29% increase in Marketplace GOV to $15.9 billion. On a year-over-year basis,\nrevenue for the first quarter of 2023 grew at a faster rate than Marketplace GOV primarily due to improved\nlogistics efficiency.\n29\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of\nrebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, insurance expenses, costs related\nto placing orders with non-partner merchants, and costs related to first party product sales, for which we take\ncontrol of inventory, (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding merchants and Dashers, costs for\nproviding support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform infrastructure costs, and (iii)\npersonnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to our local operations, support,\nand other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses primarily include salary, bonus,\nbenefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined based on an allocation of shared\ncosts, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information technology costs, among all departments\nbased on employee headcount.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions, except percentages)                               2022        2023    % Change\nCost of revenue, exclusive of        $                           763    $  1,069          40  %\ndepreciation and amortization\nCost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased by $306 million, or 40%, for the first\nquarter of 2023 , compared to the same quarter of 2022 . The increase was primarily driven by an increase of $203\nmillion in order management costs and an increase of $29 million in platform costs, driven primarily by growth in\nTotal Orders. Order management costs also increased due to an increase in insurance reserves, and costs associated\nwith our first-party distribution business. Additionally, personnel-related compensation expenses and allocated\noverhead increased by $66 million driven by increased headcount.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the\nreferrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing\nexpenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense\nincluding amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions, except percentages)                               2022       2023    % Change\nSales and marketing                  $                           414    $   496          20  %\nSales and marketing expenses increased by $82 million, or 20%, for the first quarter of 2023, compared to the same\nquarter of 2022.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful\ninformation to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our\npast performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our\nmanagement in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures\nto assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we\nbelieve that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results\nof operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics.

We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA\nbecause (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting\nor forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such\nexpenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative\nand regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California and similar\nlegislation.\n(2) Consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs, primarily related to the Wolt acquisition.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and\ncapitalized software and website development costs.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(in millions)                                                          2022       2023\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating    $                           -20    $   397\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment                                     -32        -39\nCapitalized software and website                                        -39        -42\ndevelopment costs\nFree Cash Flow                              $                           -91    $   316\nCredit Facilities\nOn November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an\naffiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, and further amended on October 31, 2022, provides for a\n$300 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on August 7, 2025, which increased to $400 million in\naggregate revolving commitments upon the consummation of an initial public offering, with a sublimit for the\nissuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to $200 million. Loans under the credit facility\nbear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the\nfederal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted SOFR rate for a one-\nmonth interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of one, three, or six\nmonths) rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility\nof this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of March\n31, 2023, we were in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of\nDecember 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, no revolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\n36\nTable of Contents\nWe maintain letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December\n31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, we had $132 million and $133 million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $99 million and $99 million were issued under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of shares of\nour Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of March 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of\n$3.7 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 billion, short-term marketable securities of\n$1.6 billion and long-term marketable securities of $314 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors of\n$290 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and consumers,\nas well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on\ndeposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds, commercial paper, and U.S. Treasury securities.\nMarketable securities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S.\nTreasury securities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $4.4\nbillion as of March 31, 2023. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may\nincur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may\nrequire additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nalong with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be\nsufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nWe have an obligation to our insurance provider which requires us to set aside collateral of $265 million in an\nescrow account which is restricted from general use.\nIn February 2023, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of our Class A common\nstock. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated\ntransactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market\nrepurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We\nmay also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our Class A common stock\nunder this authorization. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors,\nincluding price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions)                                                          2022       2023\nNet cash (used in) provided by operating    $                           -20    $   397\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                                  -246        -10\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing                                  5       -390\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                     1          1\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents,     $                          -260    $    -2\nand restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $397 million for the first quarter of 2023.

This primarily consisted of a net\nloss, including redeemable non-controlling interests, of $167 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation\nexpense of $129 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $59 million, non-cash reduction of\noperating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $16 million, as well as $60\nmillion net outflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our\nprepaid expenses.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $10 million for the first quarter of 2023, which primarily consisted of\npurchases of marketable securities of $434 million, purchases of property and equipment of $39 million, and cash\noutflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $42 million, partially offset by proceeds from\nmaturities and sales of marketable securities of $506 million.\nCash used in investing activities was $246 million for the first quarter of 2022, which primarily consisted of cash\npaid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $71 million, purchases of marketable securities of $656 million,\ncash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $39 million and purchases of property and\nequipment of $32 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $552\nmillion.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities was $390 million for the first quarter of 2023, which consisted of repurchases of\nClass A common stock of $392 million, partially offset by the proceeds from exercise of stock options of $2\nmillion.\nCash provided by financing activities was $5 million for the first quarter of 2022, which was the proceeds from\nexercise of stock options.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements,\nas well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nActual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our\nestimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flows could be affected.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.",

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax\nreported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of March 31, 2023, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest\nrates would not have materially affected our condensed consolidated financial statements. We currently do not hedge\nthese interest rate exposures.\n38\nTable of Contents\nEquity Price Risk\nOur non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes\nother than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these\nsecurities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the\nearly stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies. However,\nwe believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $125 million as of March 31, 2023.\nAdjustments or impairments are recorded in other income (expense), net on the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel, and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported\nincome and loss from our international businesses included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nA continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our\ninternational businesses included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of\ntransaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nForeign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the quarter ended March 31, 2023. Based on our foreign\ncurrency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities as of March 31, 2023, we estimated that a 10% change in\nexchange rates against the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) which is part of stockholders’ equity.",

Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a\nreasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2023 that\nhave materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent\n39\nTable of Contents\nlimitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control\nissues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that\njudgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake.\nAdditionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more\npeople or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon\ncertain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will\nsucceed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become\ninadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may\ndeteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud\nmay occur and not be detected.\n40\nTable of Contents",

Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third parties (individually or as class\nactions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. For\nsome matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses\nis not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the\napplication of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a\nmaterial loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought under California\nLabor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and\nother matters challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. Various other\nDashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our\nplatform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual Dashers,\nwith many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our independent\ncontractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney\nfiled an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified\nCalifornia Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and\nthe California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages\nand a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent\ncontractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is\nnot estimable given the status of the case. Please see \" Risk Factors–If Dashers that utilize our platform are\nreclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected. \" for more information.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law in September\n2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the standard in Dynamex regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies,\nsupported a campaign for Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was\napproved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners\nconsisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County\nSuperior Court to compel the State of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as\nunconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding\nthat the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based\nDrivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 filed appeals in the California First\nDistrict Court of Appeal. In March 2023, the Court of Appeal overturned the Alameda County Superior\n41\nTable of Contents\nCourt's ruling and upheld nearly all of Proposition 22 as state law. In April 2023, petitioners consisting of a\nnumber of individuals and labor groups filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of California.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nour former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty and/or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to\ndefend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our\nbusiness practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with\nconsumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation\ninsurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of\nthe State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued a negative\nassessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the CA EDD’s assessment,\nand intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related\ngovernmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit,\nor inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly\nin the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or\nother action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs\nassociated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources,\nand other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or\nother incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have\nmeritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no\npending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\nhowever, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n42\nTable of Contents",

You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nincluding the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to\ninvest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could\nalso be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are\nmaterial. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and\nprospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline,\nand you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future;\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely\naffected;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or\nplatform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nincluding in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected;\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful;\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected;\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result;\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (the \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n43\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval; and\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\nsuccessfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own, including in the case of our\nacquisition of Wolt;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate, including with\nrespect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline and food costs;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\nhire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have relatively limited\nhistorical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of\noperations may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more\npredictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties\nfrequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our\nassumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect\nor change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from\nour expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and\nwe may not be able to achieve profitability, or maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net\nloss of $167 million and $161 million in the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, respectively, and, as of\nDecember 31, 2022 and March 31, 2023, we had an accumulated deficit of $3.8 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.\nWe expect our costs will increase over time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant\nadditional funds towards growing our business and operating as a public company. We have expended and expect to\ncontinue to expend substantial financial and other resources on developing our platform, including expanding our\nplatform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features and services, acquiring and integrating\ntechnologies and businesses, expanding into new markets and categories, and increasing our sales and marketing\nefforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in sufficient increased revenue or\ngrowth in our business to offset such costs. Any failure to increase our revenue\n44\nTable of Contents\nsufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from maintaining or increasing\nprofitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and\nchallenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of March 31, 2023, we had $2.3\nbillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards.\nAdditionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations\nthat arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs.\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\nlosses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain, or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our past revenue growth rate, growth in demand for\nour offerings, and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future performance.\nFor the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2023, our revenue was $1.5 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively,\nrepresenting a 40% year-over-year growth rate. In addition, during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and\n2021, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. The circumstances that\naccelerated the growth of our business during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to recur, and we\nexpect growth in consumer demand and our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to be lower in\nfuture periods compared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021. You should not rely on our revenue or key business\nmetrics for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business\nmetrics, or key business metrics growth in future periods.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the short term and\ndecline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market adoption. We may also\nexperience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in\nthe number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing competition, a decrease in\nthe growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, and increasing regulatory\ncosts. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may\nnot result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost of such investments. If our revenue growth rate\ndeclines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway (including Grubhub,\nwhich it acquired in June 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online\nordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services,\nconvenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and\nmerchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with large Internet\ncompanies with substantial resources, users, and market and brand power. In addition, we compete with traditional\noffline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to\nconsumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. Further, as we\ncontinue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these\nmarkets.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and suppliers, larger existing user bases, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, established geographic footprints and infrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical,\nand other resources than we have. For example, with grocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains\nthat have strong bargaining power, established relationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater\nfinancial resources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and\nefficiently to new or emerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may\nrender our platform less attractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a\nspecific geographic market, or if merchants\n45\nTable of Contents\nchoose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of merchant options\nor lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing to consumers. Our\ncompetitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic relationships among themselves\nor with others, including merchants. For example, in July 2022, Grubhub announced a partnership with Amazon that\nallows Amazon Prime members in the United States to receive a free trial of Grubhub's membership program. Our\ncompetitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake\nmore aggressive marketing campaigns than ours. Such efforts may lead us to lose category share or require us to\nincrease our marketing expenses in order to maintain our category share.\nIn particular, our acquisition of Wolt and the expansion of the combined company may lead to an increase in\ncompetitive pressure from both existing competitors and new entrants in an already highly competitive industry.\nThrough the acquisition, we have expanded our operations in Europe and Asia—regions that are already subject to\nintense competition in many of the categories in which we operate. As a result, existing competitors and any\nsubsequent entrants in Europe and Asia may engage in aggressive consumer acquisition campaigns, develop superior\nofferings, or consolidate with other entities and achieve benefits of scale in response to our acquisition of Wolt.\nSuch competitive pressures in an already highly competitive market may erode our category share, adversely impact\nour business, and increase the expenses associated with, or otherwise hinder, our expansion in both existing and\nnew markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and\nconsumer fees, greater incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services, consumer discounts and\npromotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, any of which may be more attractive\nthan those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission rates and fees\nor maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions to remain competitive, particularly in markets\nwhere we are not in a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively\naffect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the\nmarkets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we\nanticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the\nother competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees,\nor increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Local\non-demand delivery services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot\nguarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve, maintain or increase\nprofitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost effective to develop their own platforms to\noffer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the\nlowest-cost provider and could use more than one local commerce platform, independent contractors who provide\ndelivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and merchants\ncould prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more than one\nplatform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as existing\nofferings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain of our\nplatform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than ours, which\nwould make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate. Increased competition could result in,\namong other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform\nusers, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow\nour platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in\nnew markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers\nattracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has\ngrown in the past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and\nour national brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to\nincur substantial expenses to acquire\n46\nTable of Contents\nadditional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to acquire additional merchants\nand consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may invest significant resources\nwith the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. We\ncannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of\nacquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by\nproviding us at least seven or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any\nexclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection\navailable on our local commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our\nrelationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other\nconstituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how\ncompelling these offerings are to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership\nproducts. Additionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain\npromotions, such as discounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and\nofferings to such consumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our\nmembership products, through prompts and notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other\nofferings. However, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our\nplatform after they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our\nconsumers to regular paying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform,\ndemand for our full-price or paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than\nexpected or decline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites\nand applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and\napplications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If\nconsumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than\nthrough our websites and consumer mobile applications directly, our ability to establish relationships and build\nbrand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized\nexperience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract\nand retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the ability\nto decline orders or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity provisions\nwith Dashers. Accordingly, if we do not continue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform and compelling\nopportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers or retain existing Dashers or increase their use\nof our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or work stoppages that could adversely affect\nour users and our business. Relatedly, if merchants and consumers choose to use competing offerings, we may lack\nsufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform and impact our\nability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain Dashers, we have, among other things, invested in\nmaking the use of our Dasher applications, and dashing, as frictionless as possible, created new ways for Dashers\nto earn and get paid, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, including credits to be used for orders on our\nplatform, tips and assistance using the Dasher applications, and access to programs that provide cashback rewards\non certain purchases, including gasoline. We also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing\nDashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase\nuse of our platform by existing Dashers or could have other unintended adverse consequences, including negative\npress, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our brand and reputation. Changes in\ncertain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment laws, may result in a decrease in the\npool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and\nengagement. Other factors outside of our control, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or\ninsurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers.\nIf we fail to attract Dashers, retain existing Dashers on favorable terms, or maintain or increase the use of our\nplatform by\n47\nTable of Contents\nexisting Dashers, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely\naffected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these\nmerchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods at affordable prices, meeting\nour requirements and standards, experience problems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, or choose to\nraise the prices of their goods on our platform for any other reason, our reputation and brand could be damaged.\nFurther, an increase in merchant operating costs, or other deterioration in financial condition, whether due to\ninflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or\ncease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. If merchants\non our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide consumers with\nsufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform. Additionally,\nsome items on our platform are listed at higher prices relative to their in-store prices. This practice can\nnegatively affect consumer perception of our platform and could result in a decline in consumers or order volume,\nor both, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses, including in the case of our\nacquisition of Wolt;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nour business mix between our Marketplaces and Platform Services;\nthe contribution to our overall business of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal\npatterns in restaurant dining;\nthe impact of weather on our business;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe contribution to our overall business of our advertising products and services, including the effect that\nmarket conditions may have on our ability to sell these products and services;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\n48\nTable of Contents\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of outbreaks of contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response of governments\nand private industry;\nthe impact of price controls that may be imposed by various jurisdictions, and any associated increase in the\nfees we may have to impose to offset such price controls;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become\nincreasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of\nour platform, especially during peak usage times, as our operations grow and the usage of our platform increases.\nSome of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result\nfrom interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time\nto time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These\nevents have resulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of\nrevenue and may harm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to\nconsumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event,\nincluding for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may\nvoluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse\nfrom us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to\naddress. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the\navailability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and\ncould result in the loss of users.\n49\nTable of Contents\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nincluding in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets\nand arrangements that complement our business. For example, on May 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Wolt.\nWe have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to evaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent\nmarkets and there is no assurance that such acquired businesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we\nenter into, will be successfully integrated into our business, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits\non a timely basis or at all.\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and\nnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and\nadversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\ndifficulties integrating the technologies, operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts, and\npersonnel of an acquired business;\ndifficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business,\nand difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\ndifficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\nchallenges integrating accounting, finance, and forecasting practices of acquired businesses with our own,\nespecially in the context of international businesses;\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense\nsharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership\ninvestments;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndifficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones,\nlanguages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\ncurrency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with foreign jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment\nopportunities;\nthe need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public\ncompany like ours at companies we may acquire that prior to acquisition may not have robust controls, procedures,\nand policies, in particular, with respect to the effectiveness of internal controls, cyber and information security\npractices, incident response plans, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans, compliance with privacy,\ndata protection, information security, and other regulations, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and\nsanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an investment or acquired\nbusiness, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices,\nlitigation, information security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand management, revenue recognition\nor other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nthe enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our\nability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions\n(such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the\ncompletion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\nan acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our\nexisting business;\n50\nTable of Contents\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction,\nwhich may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\nas a result of an acquisition, third parties we or an acquired business works with may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions, seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired business,\nor consider working with a competitor instead; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our\nresults of operation, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or if\nthe transaction costs are greater than expected.\nIn particular, the ongoing integration of Wolt into our business poses heightened risks, including write-offs or\nrestructuring charges, unanticipated costs, regulatory and compliance risk associated with operating in a number of\nnew jurisdictions, operational difficulties, and the loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that the\nintegration will be accomplished effectively or in a timely manner. In addition, the integration of Wolt will\nsubject us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the completion of the acquisition,\nsome of which may be unknown. Although we and our advisers have conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt\nand we have certain rights of indemnification, including an escrow of acquisition consideration to secure certain\nobligations of Wolt's securityholders, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of Wolt or\nthat the amounts in escrow will be sufficient. Further, the escrow consists of shares and therefore, even if we are\nable to recover from the escrow, we will need to use our cash and resources to pay for the liabilities and damages.\nThese liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition not currently known to us\nor that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations, including our profitability.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, in\nOctober 2021, we closed a $395 million investment in preferred shares of a private grocery delivery platform\ncompany based in Europe. Strategic investments inherently involve less control over business operations of the\ninvestee, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks\nassociated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners,\ncontrolling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business\ninterests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions\nor omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them\nmay adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and may\notherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our investments\nmay be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities\nnow or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct\ninvestment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity is subject to regulatory\nreview, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our\nability to carry out our long-term business strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments\nwill generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For\nexample, during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, in the course of evaluating our investments, we determined\nimpairment indicators existed for a previously disclosed investment in a grocery delivery platform company.\nFollowing a valuation of this investment, we incurred an impairment of $312 million associated with our non-\nmarketable equity securities.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets\nand arrangements and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such\nacquisitions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful.\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S.\nmarkets as part of our growth strategy. We currently operate in over 25 countries across the globe. Our operations\noutside of the United States require significant operating expenses and management attention in order to oversee\noperations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural norms, and customs, in addition to\nplacing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Our current\ninternational operations and our plans for investment in non-U.S. markets subject us to a number of risks and we\nmay not be successful in our international operations for a variety of reasons, including:\nan inability to recruit and retain talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintain our company\nculture across all of our offices;\n51\nTable of Contents\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\ndifficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, Dashers, and consumers in non-U.S.\nmarkets;\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards across jurisdictions, including with respect to labor and\nemployment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export control and sanctions, public health, payment processing,\ntransactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\nincreased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue\nrecognition and similar accounting principles;\ndifficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and\ncustoms, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it\nrelates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\nunique and varying terms and conditions in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\nvarying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\nforeign currency exchange restrictions or costs;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations and differences in available instruments to invest our funds, including the risk profile associated\nwith such investments, and limitations on our ability to repatriate funds.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security\nrisks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards,\nincluding with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions such as\nU.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, the civil\nunrest in Kazakhstan required Wolt to temporally suspend its business operations in the country due to safety and\nsecurity concerns, as well as the unavailability of, and significant disruptions to, Internet service. While we\nhave been able to resume business operations in Kazakhstan, such events may occur in the future in other countries\nor regions leading to similar disruptions. In addition, Wolt's operations in markets that are in close proximity to\nRussia increases the difficulty in complying with trade and economic sanction regimes related to business with\nRussia.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local commerce platforms will have an adverse\nimpact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, fees and commissions charged by local\ncommerce platforms have\n52\nTable of Contents\nbeen under increased scrutiny and are expected to continue to be subject to political and public debate in the\njurisdictions in which we and our subsidiaries operate. Many jurisdictions in which we have operations have price\ncontrol measures in effect on local commerce platforms and we expect other such measures may be enacted in the\nfuture. These price controls have caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to\nconsumers. To the extent that price control measures lead to an increase in the fees we charge to consumers,\nconsumer demand for our services could be reduced, which would further harm our business and results of operations.\nOur risks related to price controls are described in more detail under “— Our business is subject to a variety of\nlaws and regulations globally, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing\nand commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and\nregulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results\nof operations and subject us to legal claims .”\nCertain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings.\nSimilarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract and retain new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There can be no assurance that we will not be forced, through\ncompetition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we\npay to Dashers that utilize our platform, further reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or increase\nour marketing and other expenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive\npressures. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, including Dasher\nor consumer loyalty programs, such as our membership products like DashPass and Wolt+, or modify existing pricing\nmethodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers and which may result in lower\ncommissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, our consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our business model and\npricing methodologies may not be competitive in these locations. As a result, our continued international expansion\nmay require us to change our operations and pricing strategies to adjust to different cultural norms, including\nwith respect to consumer pricing and gratuities.\nOur assessments about optimal pricing strategy may not be accurate and may not enable us to compete in the\ncategories and regions in which we operate effectively. There may also be errors or defects in the technology we\nuse to set our prices, which could result in underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, if the services\non our platform change, then we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Any such pricing assumptions,\ntechnological errors or defects in pricing, or changes to our pricing methodology could adversely affect demand for\nour platform, our brand and reputation, and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay models for Dashers.\nOur pay models for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to\nlead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under a former\npay model for Dashers in the United States, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases\nwhen a consumer left little or no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers by making every\ndelivery economically worthwhile, it also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the\nmisimpression that not all tips were being received by Dashers. Government authorities have brought claims against\nus related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model and may bring similar claims in the future. For example, on\nNovember 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed an action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia\nalleging violations of the District of Columbia’s Consumer Protection Procedures Act with respect to our former\nDoorDash Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court entered a consent order and judgment to resolve the\nlitigation. We could face similar claims related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model from other government\nauthorities in the future.\nWe have also launched, and may in the future launch, changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that\nutilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers and may result in\nnegative publicity. For example, we increased the amount we pay to DoorDash Dashers per order when we changed our\npay model in September 2019, but this pay model also causes less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some\ncases. Further, this pay model has resulted in, and in the future may result in, negative publicity related to\nperceptions of its complexity, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers\ncan leave tips, and as a result, we may not be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and\nDashers. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes and expansion into\nnew categories and geographies, we may change our Dasher pay models again. Our current Dasher pay models, and any\nfuture changes to our pay models or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an\nincrease to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain\nconsumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n53\nTable of Contents\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that\nDashers may be reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law or laws of other jurisdictions in which we\noperate. As discussed further elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have been involved in and\ncontinue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification in the United States, and\nsuch proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations\nWest, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”), including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in\nJune 2020. Certain risks related to reclassification of Dashers that use our platform are described in more detail\nunder “ —If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law , or\nthe laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate , our business, financial condition, and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected .” A reclassification of Dashers as employees could require us to revise our pricing\nmethodologies and Dasher pay models to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other\nsubstantive internal adjustments to account for any transition of a subset of Dashers to employment positions,\nwhich would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. We have\nexperienced rapid employee headcount growth at our San Francisco headquarters, in a number of our offices across\nthe United States, internationally, and with employees working remotely globally. We have also expanded our\npresence, both in employee headcount and operationally, in Europe and Asia through our acquisition of Wolt. This\ngrowth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial\ninfrastructure.\nOur failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as a result of our rapid\ngrowth, including at Wolt and other companies we may acquire, could result in errors in our condensed consolidated\nfinancial statements that could result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to\nmeet our reporting obligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could cause a decline in\nthe price of our Class A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and financial\ninfrastructure in order to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nSimilarly, our failure to implement and maintain effective data and information security systems with respect to\nour platform as we grow could result in breaches, security incidents, theft or fraud, service disruptions, loss of\nuser confidence in our platform, legal claims, regulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation or brand,\nany of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, services, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our\noperational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large\nnumber of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge\nour ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our\nplatform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more\nimportant as competition in our industry further intensifies. Similarly, maintaining and enhancing the Wolt\nreputation and brand will be particularly important for our continued growth in Europe and Asia. Successfully\nmaintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our\nplatform will depend on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality\nservices and support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash”\nand \"Wolt\" marks, our logos, and other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of other factors,\nmany of which are outside our control. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in\npromoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives new user growth and engagement, but future marketing\nefforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our users have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods,\n54\nTable of Contents\nincluding other local commerce platforms and services, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time.\nTo expand our user base, we must appeal to new users who may have historically used other methods of delivering\ngoods or other local commerce platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. The effect\nof negative publicity could be exacerbated to the extent dissatisfaction with, or complaints concerning, us are\ndisseminated via social media, due to its immediacy and accessibility as a means of communication. Any such\nexpressions of dissatisfaction or complaints, even if ultimately concluded to be unfounded or successfully resolved\nwithout direct adverse financial effects, could still harm our brand, reputation, and local network effects.\nNegative perception of our platform or company may result from:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform,\nincluding highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including\nDasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nfraud;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\ntraffic accidents caused by, or involving, Dashers or employee couriers or death or serious injury involving a\nDasher or employee couriers or any party associated with us;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or otherwise pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission, or not clearly articulated;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements, including violations of food\ninformation and alcohol delivery age verification regulations;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant, and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\nour operations in regions that are or become subject to geopolitical instability, conflict, or economic\nsanctions, and any negative consequences of such operations to us, our merchants, consumers, or Dashers; or\n55\nTable of Contents\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but\nnegatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance\nthe interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely\naffect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, Dasher\npay models, user support, technology, platform policies, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues,\nprivacy or security practices, management team, compliance with laws and regulations, or the health and safety of\nDashers, employee couriers, merchants, and consumers using our platform could adversely affect our reputation. Such\nnegative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and loyalty of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which\nDashers were compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general\nfood safety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers, and merchants using our platform,\nwhich has adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to scale and public awareness of\nour brand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an amplified negative effect on our\nreputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands, influencers, or other third parties\nthat we have partnered with or may partner with in the future may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is\nnot directly related to us. Any negative publicity that we may receive could diminish confidence in, and the use\nof, our platform, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our\nbrand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive\nand proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary\ndata relating to our business, including our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our employees.\nCybersecurity incidents are increasing in severity and sophistication and can originate with external actors or\nwith our employees and contractors, whether acting maliciously or by inadvertently providing access to an external\nparty or having their credentials compromised by an external party. Further, due to the current geopolitical\nenvironment, there is heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents sponsored by state actors, which could target\nbusinesses. These incidents can originate on our vendors’ systems, which can be leveraged to access our websites,\nplatforms, and data, including personal data. We and our vendors have previously experienced these types of\nbreaches and other incidents. For example, in August 2022, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors\nthat resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of certain consumers and Dashers. In addition, in December\n2021, we investigated and patched Log4j vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could have allowed for unauthorized\nremote code execution in our systems. We have undertaken steps to enhance our data security and governance program,\nwhich include adding security layers around data, improving access controls, hiring additional personnel with data\nsecurity experience, and using outside expertise to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all\npotential causes of these incidents have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or other\nincidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and\nmay not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate or\nprevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we and our vendors\nmay face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems used in our\nbusiness through various means,\n56\nTable of Contents\nincluding gaining unauthorized access to the systems of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform. In\naddition, there may be attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or\nothers into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other sensitive information resulting in\nthe fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. With the prevalence of remote work, we may be exposed to increased\nrisks of breaches or incidents via such methods.\nAlthough we have taken measures to protect our systems and the data in our possession, these measures have not\nfully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. Our IT and infrastructure may\nbe vulnerable to viruses, social engineering, vulnerabilities, denial of service, credential stuffing, ransomware\nand other malware, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption, and unauthorized parties may be\nable to access data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data, through those systems.\nAlthough we have policies restricting the access to the personal data we store, these policies may not be effective\nin all cases. Any actual or perceived breach or similar incident could interrupt our operations, harm our\nreputation, brand, and competitive position, result in our platform being unavailable, loss or improper access to,\nor unavailability of, data, fraudulent transfer of funds, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and significant\nlegal, regulatory, and financial exposure. Any such incidents or any perception that our security measures are\ninadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform,\nany of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, any\ncyberattacks or actual or perceived breaches or other incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could\nreduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us.\nAny actual or perceived breach or other security incident, impacting any entities with which we share or disclose\ndata (including, for example, our vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security\nmeasures is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot\nguarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not been breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects,\nbugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other disruption to, our or our vendors’\nsystems.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. While we maintain cyber insurance that may help provide coverage\nfor these types of incidents and resulting claims, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be\nadequate for liabilities incurred relating to any breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be available\nto us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future\nclaim. The successful assertion of any claim against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or changes in\nour insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance\nrequirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nThe on-demand local commerce category is still in relatively early stages of growth, and if this category does not\ncontinue to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nThe on-demand local commerce category has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is still\nrelatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. The markets\nfor certain services we facilitate, in particular convenience, grocery, advertising, and certain other categories,\nmay be in even earlier stages of development than our restaurant category, and it is uncertain whether demand for\nthese services will continue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance, if at all. In addition, through our\nacquisition of Wolt, we have entered many geographies where the development of the on-demand local commerce\ncategory may be at different stages of market acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the\nwillingness of people to widely adopt on-demand local commerce platforms. Changing traditional ordering habits is\ndifficult, and if merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to on-demand local commerce platforms as we\nexpect, including as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a\nresult of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead adopt alternative\nsolutions that may arise, then the market for our platform may not further develop or may develop slower than we\nexpect, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may negatively impact our short-term financial results when we believe that the decisions are\nconsistent with our goals to\n57\nTable of Contents\nimprove the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These\ndecisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-\nterm benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers, have\noccurred, and in the future may occur, which could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. These activities include food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation,\nhandling, or delivery, including the use of unsafe or inappropriate delivery equipment, assault, battery, theft,\nunauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering Dasher\naccounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such activities\nmay result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business\ninterruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to\nbackground checks, fraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, attempted payments\nby consumers with insufficient funds, exploitation of system bugs or vulnerabilities to circumvent payment\nrequirements, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers of Dasher accounts by bad\nactors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities involving personal\ninformation, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information, or payment information and\nunauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information, and mobile phone\nnumbers. For example, bad actors have created Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal identifying\ninformation to commit fraud on our platform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, in the United\nStates, this has caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as\nDashers. We have launched a series of initiatives and product changes to help prevent these practices, but there\ncan be no assurances that our efforts will be successful in fully remediating this or similar issues.\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit\ncard data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we\nhave taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot\nguarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to\nadequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nillegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, these measures may\nnot adequately address or prevent all such activity from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability,\nincluding through litigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we\nhave deactivated from our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform\ndeliveries. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check where permitted by\napplicable law, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from\nusing our platform, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are\nperceived to have failed to do so, or if our competitors do not adopt similar measures, the growth and engagement\nof the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal, improper, or otherwise\ninappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which enables merchants on our\nMarketplaces to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are retained directly by\nmerchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in any of the other\nactivities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on our platform. Any negative publicity\nrelated to incidents involving illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, or the measures we adopt\nto mitigate the risk of such incidents, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our competitors’\nplatforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a whole, which\ncould negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n58\nTable of Contents\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which sometimes includes facilitating deliveries to\nconsumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less\noperationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner\nmerchants’ systems. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order and a higher\nlikelihood of errors. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with\nfacilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nSome non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. There is a\nrisk that non-partner merchants will bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. For\nexample, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair competition, among other claims, and\nsought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. In addition, measures have been enacted in\nmany U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit, among other things, on-demand local commerce platforms like ours from\nfacilitating deliveries from restaurants without the restaurants’ prior consent. We have adopted internal policies\npursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our platform in the United\nStates and require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner restaurants on our platform in the United\nStates to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with us. However, we continue to add non-partner\nmerchants in categories other than restaurants. In the future, we may continue to revise and update our internal\npolicies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we are required or we choose to\nremove non-partner merchants for any reason, this may adversely affect our ability to provide a broad selection of\nmerchants on our platform, attract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsites and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail\nto expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance\nand improve our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely\naffected. To compete effectively, we must also provide a convenient, efficient, and reliable consumer experience on\nour platform, and we may be unable to effectively address consumer needs or identify emerging consumer trends. If\ncompetitors introduce new features, offerings, or technologies, or if new industry standards and practices or\nconsumer trends emerge, our existing technology, services, websites, and mobile applications may become less\npopular or obsolete. For example, our competitors may develop and commercialize autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies at scale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone\ndelivery to market before we do, or their technology is, or is perceived to be, superior to our or our partners’\ntechnology, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success could depend on our ability\nto invest in, develop, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a\ncost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to, and new services on, our platform may involve significant technical risks, the time and\nattention of our personnel, including management and key employees, and upfront capital investments that may not\ngenerate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging\nindustry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features and services or if\nour recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nWe face certain risks with our convenience, grocery, and other retail operations in connection with our self-\noperated convenience and grocery stores.\nWe face certain risks in connection with the operation of DashMart and Wolt Market, our first-party owned and self-\noperated convenience and grocery delivery businesses. To build and expand DashMart and Wolt Market, we have made\nsubstantial investments, including in establishing and managing a reliable supply chain for groceries, including\nthe maintenance of a cold chain to ensure food safety and hygiene, establishing supply-related contractual\npartnerships,\n59\nTable of Contents\ninventory management, leasing premises, hiring personnel, and rolling out relevant technologies and processes. We\nalso plan to continue to invest in such businesses in the future. The maintenance and expansion of our DashMart and\nWolt Market businesses requires significant investments, and there is no assurance that we will realize any of the\nanticipated benefits. In locations where we operate DashMart and Wolt Market, we may not be able to generate a\nsufficient number of orders to make such services viable in certain locations and we may incur significant costs\nbefore we can determine the viability of these DashMart and Wolt Market locations. Our self-operated retail\nlocations also expose us to different regulatory requirements and risks than our Marketplaces and Platform\nServices, in particular with respect to food safety, alcoholic beverage licenses, and zoning restrictions. Our\nexpansion into convenience, grocery, and other retail categories, may also result in the diversion of management’s\nattention from other business opportunities as well as the diversion of resources from support functions, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may\nbe difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset\nthe additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,\nwe expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the resulting gains in\nefficiency to our platform that we expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business\nand subject to a number of risks, including changes to our Dasher pay models and changes in macroeconomic\nconditions. The cost effectiveness of our platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and\ntechnological improvements do not reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and\nrefunds and credits. If we are unable to maintain or improve the cost effectiveness of our platform, including with\nrespect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nnot only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of non-U.S. based\nusers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with\ndelivering support in languages other than English and in ways consistent with the customs and dominant\ntechnologies used in the various geographies in which we operate. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or\na market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect\nour ability to scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending habits and Dasher behavior patterns, each of which have a\nsignificant impact on our growth and expenses. We may experience changes in consumer activity over the course of\nthe\n60\nTable of Contents\ncalendar year, although our rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to\nmake, seasonal fluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity may be impacted by weather. Colder\nor more inclement weather may increase consumer demand, while warmer or sunny weather may decrease consumer demand.\nIn contrast, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of cold or inclement weather, during times\nwhen we need more Dashers available to fulfill orders driven by increased consumer demand. In such instances, we\ntypically rely on incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which\nincreases our costs. Further, severe weather can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, making it\nimpossible for Dashers to fulfill deliveries. We also benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets\nwhen school is in session, and we experience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during\nsummer breaks and other vacation periods, causing a decrease in Dasher pay and adverse effects to our results of\noperations during impacted periods. Seasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a\nquarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience\nmay become more pronounced and contribute to greater fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to\nscale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our results of operations and we may not be\nable to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than expected, causing our results of operations\nto fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to variable global economic conditions in the regions in which we do business and their\nimpact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors that may impact consumer spending on our platform\ninclude general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, fluctuations in household net worth, inflation\ngenerally, fluctuations in gasoline, vehicle, and transportation costs, increased food costs, fluctuations in\ncommodity prices, declines in asset prices, residential real estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices,\nchanges in interest rates and credit availability, consumer confidence, uncertainty regarding the current and\nfuture political and economic environment, and other macroeconomic factors. Economic conditions in certain regions\nmay also be affected or exacerbated by natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats\nto public health, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, volatility in the global financial markets, or in\nspecific segments of those markets, may contribute to banks and financial institutions with whom we have banking or\npayment processing relationships entering receivership or becoming insolvent in the future, and we may be unable to\naccess or may lose some or all of our existing cash and cash equivalents to the extent those funds are not insured\nor otherwise protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other insurance programs. Such volatility\nmay also adversely impact any funds held temporarily at our third-party payment processors.\nConsumer purchases, particularly of discretionary items, may decline during recessions and other periods in which\ndisposable income is adversely affected, periods of economic uncertainty, or when there is a loss of consumer\nconfidence in the economy. Consumers may choose to reduce their spending on our platform or forego spending on our\nplatform altogether. Further, because spending on our platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we\nexpect that any decline in consumer spending would have a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those\nbusinesses that sell products or services considered to be necessities. If spending on our platform declines, or\ngrows at a slower rate, including as a result of reduced discretionary consumer spending, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages and supply chain issues at merchants could negatively\nimpact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplaces and in our Drive\nbusiness. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact consumer demand\nand drive lower order volume on our Marketplaces and in our Drive business. Small businesses that do not have\nsubstantial resources, like many of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor\neconomic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform, including our small business merchants,\ncease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we may not\nbe able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our platform.\nAs our business has grown, including in connection with our acquisition of Wolt, we have increasingly become\nsubject to risks arising from adverse global economic and political conditions, including Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine. While our business does not operate in Russia or Ukraine, we have operations in countries that border\nRussia and Ukraine and are exposed to the economic impacts of that conflict on the region. Russia’s invasion of\nUkraine has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions in the region and give\nrise to volatility and instability in a manner that adversely affects our business and merchants, consumers, and\nDashers on our platform. Russia’s invasion of\n61\nTable of Contents\nUkraine could also negatively impact consumer confidence and spending globally and in the neighboring countries in\nwhich we operate, disrupt supply chains, and drive inflationary cost increases for labor, fuel, materials, food,\nand services, all of which may negatively impact our business.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new geographic markets and categories in which we have\nlimited or no prior operating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new geographic markets and categories. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately\npredict consumer preferences and purchasing habits in these new geographic markets and categories. In addition,\neach market and category has unique regulatory dynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or\nindirectly affect our ability to operate, the pool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with\ninsurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new Dashers. In addition, each market and category is subject to distinct\ncompetitive and operational dynamics. These include our ability to offer more attractive services than alternative\noptions and our ability to efficiently attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect\nour sales, results of operations, and key business metrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our\nresults of operations due to the changing dynamics in the geographic markets and categories in which we operate. If\nwe invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are unable to manage these risks effectively,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. For more information on\nrisks associated with entry into new markets internationally see the section titled “— Our international operations\nand any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be\nsuccessful. ” For more information on risks associated with the entry into new categories see the section titled “—\nWe face certain risks in expanding our convenience, grocery, and other retail operations, especially in connection\nwith our self-operated convenience and grocery stores .”\nWe are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our operations in foreign countries. When\nconducting business in foreign countries, including through Wolt and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nbusiness is typically denominated in the local currency of the respective country, which exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposure is currently to the euro,\nthe Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel, and the Australian dollar. Additionally, because our financial statements\nare presented in U.S. dollars, local currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange\nrates for inclusion in our condensed consolidated financial statements, thereby increasing our foreign exchange\ntranslation risk.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our\nbusiness. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our\nemployees have received, and may in the future receive,\n62\nTable of Contents\nsignificant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which may reduce their motivation to continue\nto work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity to attract and retain new employees\nand expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train, and integrate such employees, and we may\nnever realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to effectively manage our hiring needs or successfully\nintegrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts, and employee morale, productivity, and engagement\ncould suffer, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\nan increasing share of our workforce working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and spending less time collaborating\nin offices;\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions, including in the case of our acquisition of\nWolt;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; and\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management.\nAny of the foregoing factors may be further exacerbated as a result of the reduction in workforce that was\ndisclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K on December 1, 2022. If we are not able to maintain and evolve our\nculture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange (the \"NYSE\"). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to\nincrease our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-\nconsuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations. We also need to implement, integrate, and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting at companies we acquire, including in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, and any failure\nto do so could impact our ability to meet our financial reporting obligations.\n63\nTable of Contents\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports\nregarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\nexcessive number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return\nto our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not\neffectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and\nnetwork architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in\nreputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions into our platform, offerings, services and features,\nand these applications may become important in our operations over time. Our competitors or other third parties may\nincorporate AI into their products more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to\ncompete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if the content, analyses, or\nrecommendations that AI applications assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, or biased,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. The use of AI applications\nhas resulted in, and may in the future result in, cybersecurity incidents that implicate the personal data of end\nusers of such applications. Any such cybersecurity incidents related to our use of AI applications could adversely\naffect our reputation and results of operations. AI also presents emerging ethical issues and if our use of AI\nbecomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal liability. The\nrapid evolution of AI, including potential government regulation of AI, will require significant resources to\ndevelop, test and maintain our platform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI ethically in\norder to minimize unintended, harmful impact.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after\n64\nTable of Contents\nrelease could result in negative publicity and a loss of users, revenue, and availability of our platform, as well\nas other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in\nexposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We\nmay need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around\nerrors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any\nsuch errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting and/or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will\nresult in dilution to our stockholders. We also permit certain RSU holders to elect to cover the RSU tax\nwithholding liabilities by providing to us a cash payment amount.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs, we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued\nwith respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations, (ii) have\nthe holders of such RSUs use a broker to sell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement\ndate, with the proceeds of such sales to be delivered to us for remittance to the relevant taxing authorities, in\norder to satisfy such tax withholding and remittance obligations, which is generally referred to as \"sell-to-\ncover,\" or (iii) allow certain holders of such RSUs to pay us an amount in cash, via a broker, sufficient to cover\nthe applicable RSU tax withholding obligations. If we withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would\notherwise be issued with respect to the vesting and/or settlement of RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in\ncash to satisfy such tax obligations, this may result in significant cash expenditures by us. We have implemented\n“sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, pursuant to which shares with a market value equivalent to\nthe tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover\nthe tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the taxing authorities.\nSuch sales or any cash amount that the holder provides to us to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding\nobligations, in either case, will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the tax\nwithholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number of\nshares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts, key business and non-\nGAAP metrics, such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted\nGross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, and certain other metrics required\nby regulatory and administrative bodies, such as the monthly active recipients of our services in the EU (as\nrequired by Article 24(2) of the Digital Services Act), with internal systems and tools that are not independently\nverified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due\nto differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have\na number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result\nin unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools\nwe use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors,\nthe data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our\nplatform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics could be impacted by\nfraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even\nthough this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement measures to detect and prevent this behavior.\nConsumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our platform. In addition,\nlimitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect\nour understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating\nmetrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be\naccurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, investors may lose confidence in\nour operating metrics and business and we expect that we could be subject to legal claims, including securities\nclass action lawsuits, and our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\n65\nTable of Contents\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions\nand insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive\nmodeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial\nprojections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently\nrepresented in the historical data or which are not yet quantifiable. A number of external factors can affect the\nactual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open,\nfluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected\nevents such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such factors can impact the\nreserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves\nfor claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. For\nany of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our condensed consolidated financial statements. If we\ndetermine that our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the\ntime of the determination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall\nis determined and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.\nIn addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations\nof the SEC, and the listing standards of the NYSE. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among other things, we\nfile annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over\nfinancial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to increase our\nlegal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public company, we may\nbe subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract management, and impact\nthe manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a result of disclosure of\ninformation in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition will become more visible,\nwhich may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our\nmanagement team may not successfully or efficiently manage our operations as a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under federal securities laws and the continuous\nscrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant\nattention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our\nbusiness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n66\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in\njurisdictions in Europe and Asia, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as\nindependent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an independent contractor or an employee vary by\ngoverning law and are typically highly fact intensive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and\nclassification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various\nauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and\nconsumers that use our platform. For example, in October 2022, the U.S. Department of Labor released a proposed\nrule regarding the classification of employees and independent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards\nAct. The proposed rule would implement new interpretative guidance for classification of workers. We maintain that\nDashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors. However, Dashers may be\nreclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on worker classification and\ntheir potential impact on the local commerce industry. A reclassification of Dashers as employees would adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to PAGA and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly\nalter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability to add and retain Dashers to our platform\nand grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in\nDynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for\nexample, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. For more details on this\naction, please see the section titled \" Legal Proceedings \" above in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nSome jurisdictions in the United States, Europe, and Asia have modified, or are considering modifying, their\nstandards used to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill\n(\"AB 5\") and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January\n1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and\ncreated numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for Proposition 22\n(“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was approved by voters in\nNovember 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court\nin California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney\nGeneral and other groups and individuals appealed to the California First District Court of Appeal. In March 2023,\nthe Court of Appeal overturned the Alameda County Superior Court’s ruling and upheld nearly all of Proposition 22\nas state law. In April 2023, petitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a petition\nfor review in the Supreme Court of California. To the extent\n67\nTable of Contents\nProposition 22 remains in effect, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements,\nare applicable to us and Dashers in California. These provisions have increased our costs related to Dashers in\nCalifornia. To offset a portion of these increased costs, in certain circumstances we charge higher fees and\ncommissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to\nincrease fees and commissions, these increased costs could also lead to a lower Net Revenue Margin, which we\nreferred to in past SEC filings as Take Rate, defined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The\nprovisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now applicable to us include, but are not limited to, (i) net\nearnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other amounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings floor equal\nto (A) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged time and (B) for Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per\nengaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for inflation in future years) and (ii) for Dashers averaging at least\n15 hours per week of engaged time during a calendar quarter who subscribe to a qualifying health plan, payments to\nsuch Dashers of healthcare subsidies of varying dollar amounts depending on a Dasher’s engaged time per week. As\nsuch, Proposition 22 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may propose or support\nlegislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, that would pair worker flexibility and\nindependence with new protections and benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we\npropose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, we would expect our costs\nrelated to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such\njurisdictions if it becomes necessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would\nadversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such\ninitiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation. If Dashers are determined to be\nemployees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, including as a\nresult of litigation, this could result in increases to our costs related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to\nincrease fees and commissions and may result in lower order volumes, which in turn would have an adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. For example, on November 1, 2021, the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration (through\nthe Division at the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland) issued a decision which deemed that\nWolt courier partners in Finland are in an employment relationship with Wolt, and that Wolt should be mandated to\nkeep statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. We have appealed the decision to the Administrative\nCourt of Hämeenlinna. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing the standards used to determine\nworker classification, which may impact our classification of Dashers using our platform. For example, the EU is\nconsidering new criteria for determining worker classification, which could be adopted by member states. Any\npotential EU-wide legislative reform may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent contractor\nmodel within the EU.\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, we may\ndecide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result in certain operational\nchallenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain jurisdictions or decide not to expand our\nbusiness in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion opportunities.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result.\nWe face potential liability, legal expenses, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business\ngenerally, and with the delivery services we facilitate in particular. Specifically, we are subject to claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal, regulatory, and other administrative\nproceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker classification, labor and\nemployment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints, intellectual property\ndisputes, marketing and advertising to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, compliance with regulatory requirements,\nand other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations,\nand legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by merchants and Dashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury\nclaims, which we sometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to\nprevent the uncertainty of litigating, and we\n68\nTable of Contents\nexpect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we face increasing public scrutiny.\nSimilarly, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic beverages or alcohol consumption.\nRegardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any consumers, Dashers,\nemployees, or third parties could result in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to threatened and\nactual legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could\ndo so in the future as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our\nplatform that generate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our\nbusiness. The potential for acts of terrorism on the United States or international food supply also exists and, if\nsuch an event occurs, it could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through\nour platform could be subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a\nfood recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our\nplatform, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to Dasher\nearnings, sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher,\nincluding our background check processes, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email,\ntext, or telephone. We also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers\nrelating to, among other things, our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect\nto sales tax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the local food delivery fulfillment services we\nfacilitate, discrepancies between the menus on our websites and consumer mobile applications and the menus at the\nrestaurant from which the food is delivered, including discrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and\ntaxes on such items, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or\ntelephone. In addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other\nrepresentative actions, by or relating to merchants regarding, among other things, menu pricing, exclusivity\narrangements, and the listing of merchants on our platform without an agreement.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our\nwebsites and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and\nnegligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security\nincident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our\nnotification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or\nregulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious\nor not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. It is possible that a resolution of one or more such\nproceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. There can be no\nguarantee that our litigation reserves will be sufficient to offset such liabilities. These proceedings could also\nresult in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders requiring a\nchange in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other legal\nobligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and current\nand former directors and officers.\nIn the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, we include arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform.\nThese provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some\ncases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in court. However, arbitration can be costly and\nburdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our\nreputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize\nthese risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or\nbe required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which\n69\nTable of Contents\ncould cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our platform\nto opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between U.S. state and federal law, there is a risk that some\nor all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or\nin part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our\nbusiness or to local commerce platforms generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions\nabout tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes and digital\nservices taxes. Such taxes could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and gross receipt\ntaxes in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as Canada, Australia, and several\ncountries in Europe and Asia, and we may face various indirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign\njurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise\nquestions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require\nus to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest,\nincluding tax on the cost of goods sold, and could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by\none or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to\ncollect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax\nliabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the appropriate\nauthorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally, if merchants\ntry to pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline. Although we\nhave reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial\nstatements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition and results of operations would be\nharmed.\nUnder U.S. state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain\nstates. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and to the cost of goods, fees, or other\nitems charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use, or other\ntaxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales and\nadditional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our platform. Any\nof the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing\nauthorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\ncollect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related\nlegislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc. , certain states have enacted\nlaws that require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on certain online sales. Requiring tax reporting or\ncollection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. These laws could\nrequire us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated with tax\ncalculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less attractive and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n70\nTable of Contents\nAlso, the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in substantial financial liability and other consequences to us if we were\nunable to remedy such failures in a timely manner.\nFurther, we have several subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with local transfer pricing rules and regulations,\nand failure to comply with such rules could adversely affect our financial condition. Transfer pricing rules\ngenerally require pricing on intra-group transactions to meet an arm's-length standard, which is inherently\nsubjective and subject to challenge. Additionally, these rules generally require documentation substantiating the\nappropriateness of such pricing, which may vary based on the jurisdiction. As a result, we may be exposed to\ntransfer pricing risks, as governmental authorities may challenge our compliance with these rules.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our condensed consolidated financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our\nresults of operations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the\nultimate tax outcome is determined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\ncertain non-deductible expenses, and the realization of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate\nwould reduce profitability or increase losses. As we expand the scale of our international business activities, any\nchanges in the United States or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate\nand harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, income earned by us and our subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction, such as\nin the jurisdiction we or the applicable subsidiary is incorporated or organized, as well as the jurisdiction from\nwhich such income is derived. This may result in double taxation if relief is not available under applicable U.S.\nor non-U.S. law or an applicable tax treaty. Any double taxation may impact the financial results of our\noperations.\nFederal, state, local, and foreign governments may amend existing taxation laws or enact new taxation legislation\napplicable to our business activities, including but not limited to legislation adopting the Pillar One and Pillar\nTwo agreements of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. These changes in legislation could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and\nforeign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. In addition, the application of\nfederal, state, local, and foreign taxation laws to our business is novel and evolving, and new judicial or\nadministrative interpretations of these laws may increase our tax exposure. While we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes from tax examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no\nassurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority or judicial body would not\nhave an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to\nemployment taxes and sales taxes are described in more detail under “ —If Dashers that utilize our platform are\nreclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected ” and “ —Taxing\nauthorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ”\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had accumulated $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion of U.S. federal and state net operating\nloss carryforwards (\"NOLs\"), respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to\nexpire in 2036 for U.S. federal and 2024 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate\nsufficient taxable income in time to use these NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and\nSection 383 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an\n“ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D\ntax credits, to offset its post-change income may be limited. In\n71\nTable of Contents\ngeneral, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5 percent\nstockholders” that exceeds 50 percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may apply under\nstate tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D credit carryforwards, to reduce\nfuture taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership changes\nand ownership changes that may occur in the future. Prior to the utilization of NOLs in the future, we will\ndetermine whether there are any limitations under Section 382 of the Code. In addition, we have accumulated $692\nmillion of foreign net operating losses, which may be available to reduce future taxable income in the relevant\njurisdiction. Some of these foreign NOLs will begin to expire in 2025 and it is possible that we may never realize\nthe benefits of these losses.\nThere is also a risk that due to changes in applicable law or regulatory changes (such as suspensions on the use of\nNOLs and other tax attributes by certain jurisdictions, possibly with retroactive effect) or other unforeseen\nreasons, our existing NOLs and other tax attributes could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and\nother tax attributes.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, insurance, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees. Laws,\nregulations, and standards governing issues such as worker classification or our relationship with Dashers more\ngenerally (for example, those concerning Dasher pay and insurance requirements), labor and employment, anti-\ndiscrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products, online credit card payments,\ngratuities, merchant pricing and commissions, text messaging, membership products, intellectual property, data\nretention, privacy, data sharing, data security, consumer protection, consumer fees, background checks, website and\nmobile application accessibility, and tax and other government-imposed fees are often complex, subject to change,\nand subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and\ninterpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting,\nincluding varying standards and interpretations between U.S. law and the laws of other countries, U.S. state and\nfederal law, between individual states, and even at the city and municipality level. As a result, their application\nin practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are\nprovided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative agencies. We have\nbeen proactively working with national, federal, state, and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that\nour platform is available broadly in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how\nexisting laws would be applied to our business and the new laws to which it may become subject.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their\nusers and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion\nof privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on\nthe nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,\nregulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative\nand regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business.\nFurther, we are subject to regulatory review, proceedings, and audits pursuant to national, federal, state, and\nlocal laws regulating the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products, such as\nproducts containing Cannabidiol or CBD. These regulations and laws dictate matters such as licensing requirements,\nadvertising restrictions, and consumer age verification. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our\noperations resulting from the enforcement of these existing regulations, any changes to existing regulations or\nchanges to the interpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, or the adoption of any new legislation or\nregulations could result in penalties or cause us to have to suspend sales and delivery of alcoholic beverages or\nother highly regulated products in a jurisdiction for a period of time or result in increased production, sales or\nmarketing costs, or changes to our business practices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our brand,\nreputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAs our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, particularly\nfollowing our acquisition of Wolt, we have become subject to a growing array of laws and regulations, which\nincrease the complexity and compliance risk inherent in our business. For example, the EU has recently enacted, and\nis in the process of enacting, various laws and regulations that govern digital services and markets and impose\nenvironmental sustainability obligations and disclosure requirements on businesses like ours. In particular, in\nNovember 2022, the Digital Services Act entered into force in the EU and includes new obligations to limit the\nspread of illegal content and illegal products online,\n72\nTable of Contents\nincrease the protection of minors, and provide users with more choice and transparency. The impact of these new\nregulations on the overall industry, business models, and our operations is uncertain. We may be required to\nenhance our disclosures and undertake certain changes to our products, services, fees and commissions structure,\nand operations as a result of these new requirements. Furthermore, we could be subject to administrative costs,\nregulatory proceedings, and fines, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nFurther, competition authorities in some of the markets in which Wolt operates have made queries regarding, or\ninvestigated, Wolt’s pricing-related terms or other practices and decisions have been issued by competition\nauthorities and courts concerning Wolt’s pricing-related terms and practices. Any violation of competition laws\ncould result in restraints in the way in which we operate our business. We could also be subject to claims of\nviolations of competition laws in other aspects of our business, such as alleged market sharing, price fixing, or\nexchange of competitively sensitive information. Any potential violations of competition laws could result in\nfines, render applicable pricing-related provisions or contracts unenforceable, require contractual amendments, and\nlead to claims for damages and reputational harm, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to comply with laws and regulations across the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate and to\npredict and adapt to changes in these laws is critical to our success, particularly for our continued expansion\nefforts, which may include entries into new geographic markets or new verticals in existing or new geographic\nmarkets. Additional regulatory scrutiny or changes in legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs\nand make it uneconomical for us to continue to operate in all of our current markets or to continue with our\nexpansion plans, particularly if regulations or their interpretations vary greatly or conflict between different\noperating countries. This may adversely affect our business and financial condition by preventing us from reaching\nsufficient scale in particular markets or having to change our business model or incur additional costs. Our\ninability, or perceived inability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead to additional\nregulatory scrutiny, which could result in administrative or enforcement actions, such as fines, penalties, or\nenforceable undertakings.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,\ntechnology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and\nadministrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they\nmay view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to\nour business, including by changing employment-related laws, requiring businesses like ours to maintain specific\nauto insurance coverage, or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses like ours agree to with merchants\nor the fees that we may charge consumers. Many jurisdictions in which we operate have price control measures in\neffect on local commerce platforms and we expect other such measures may be enacted in the future. These price\ncontrols have had in the past, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These\nprice controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers. To\nthe extent that price control measures lead to an increase in the fees we charge to consumers, consumer demand for\nour services could be reduced, which would further harm our business and results of operations. In addition,\ncertain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or collect such increased consumer fees on our\nplatform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as confusing and/or misleading to consumers.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses or other organizations\nthat perceive our business model negatively to raise their concerns to policymakers and regulators. These\nbusinesses and their trade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant\nresources to shape the legal and regulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market\npresence in an effort to change such legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede\nour business and the ability of merchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply\nwith these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that we may not be able to anticipate at\nthis time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce our exposure to\nthis liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain services or platform\nfeatures, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations\ncould also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and\ncivil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased\nattention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely affect\nour reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred to prevent or mitigate this\npotential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n73\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and\nregulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad, including EU anti-money laundering directives and related regulations in connection with our\noperations in Europe. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and\nour employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. These laws may also hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. In addition, we may be subject to liability, including penalties and fines, for any failure to\nsatisfy certain requirements under anti-money laundering laws, such as meeting local “know your customer” and\nongoing due diligence standards. For example, in connection with our operations in Europe, we could be liable for\npenalties of up to 10% of our revenue in a fiscal year in the event that our anti-money laundering compliance\nmeasures are found to be insufficient. All of these laws may also require that we keep accurate books and records\nand maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have\npolicies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents\nwill not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held\nresponsible, and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands, including\nas a result of our acquisition of Wolt, and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Any\nviolation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could\nresult in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees,\nloss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government\ncontracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse\nconsequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various regulations relating to payment processing.\nThe majority of payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment\nservices, which subjects us to certain payment-related regulations. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. In the United States, money transmitters are\nregulated by numerous state and local governments and agencies, many of which may define money transmitter\ndifferently. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulations and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties levied by national, federal, state,\nor local regulators in one or more jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services. For example, as a result of our\noperations in Europe, we are subject to the revised EU Payment Services Directive (\"PSD II\") and related\nregulations. One of our subsidiaries acts as an intra-group licensed payment service provider for its payment\nservices to merchants in European Economic Area (\"EEA\") countries and has obtained a payment institution license\nfrom the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with PSD II. Should our payment institution license\nbe revoked in the future, or any other enforcement measures be taken by the Finnish Financial Supervisory\nAuthority, such as imposing penalties or forcing us to cease offering certain payment facilities, our operations in\nEurope would be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we expand into new jurisdictions, the payment-related\nregulations that we are subject to will expand as well. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with\napplicable rules and regulations related to payment processing could include criminal and civil proceedings,\nforfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make significant\nchanges to our business practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny, which could interrupt\nour ability to operate in certain jurisdiction and otherwise adversely effect our business and results of\noperations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\nInternet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or\nchanges thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and\nincrease the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance\ncosts or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation,\ntariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution, social media\nmarketing, advertising\n74\nTable of Contents\npractices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, broadband\nresidential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not clear how existing laws\ngoverning issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the\nInternet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally, it is possible that foreign\ngovernment entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or websites or may even attempt\nto block access to our mobile applications and websites. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with\nany of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand, a loss in business, and\nproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the users on our platform, as well as\nother personal data relating to individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal,\nnational, and international laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use,\ndisclosure, and protection of certain types of data and require the notification of certain security breaches\ninvolving personal data. These laws and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change\nthrough new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, or changes in enforcement, and such changes may be\ninconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any changes in these laws or regulations could add further\ncomplexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and legal risk; require additional investment of resources in\ncompliance and data management programs; and result in changes or increased compliance costs in business practices\nand policies. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in our efforts to comply with\ncurrent and evolving privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols imposed by law,\nregulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations.\nApplicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property and the personal data of our\nusers. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law effective in December 2021 that would require us to\nprovide consumer data, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and delivery addresses to restaurant\nmerchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a consumer opts out. This could result in consumers\nreceiving unsolicited communications from merchants, which could lead to a negative consumer experience. We have\nfiled a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the\npendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect\non our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand.\nWe are increasingly subject to additional laws relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity as we expand\nour international operations. For example, with our acquisition of Wolt, we expanded our liability under the EU’s\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), which imposes strict requirements relating to the processing of\npersonal data as well as significant penalties, such as fines, injunctions against the processing of personal data,\nand civil litigation claims for noncompliance.\nWe rely on legal mechanisms for transferring personal data subject to GDPR. In 2020, the EU-US Privacy Shield\nFramework was invalidated in the Schrems II case by the Court of Justice of the European Union, which has created\nsignificant challenges in using other data transfer mechanisms to transfer personal data from the EEA to other\ncountries. The uncertainty around data transfers and global trends relating to national data localization could\npresent risks with respect to non-compliance, as well as increased costs to comply with complex and evolving\nrequirements.\nWe are also subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be contractually\nrequired to process and secure data in certain manners and to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the\ncosts or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations relating to privacy,\ndata protection, information security, or consumer protection.\nAdditionally, our success depends, in part, on our ability to access, collect, and use data relating to Dashers,\nmerchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as “cookies,” is further\nrestricted, regulated, or blocked by new laws, regulations, and other practices, the amount or accuracy of Internet\nuser information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations that\nsignificantly restrict the practice of online tracking. Other regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the use of\nonline tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem.\nMoreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers, such as Apple and Google, plan to or have\nimplemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block\n75\nTable of Contents\ntracking technologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely\nadopted, significantly reduce the effectiveness of such practices and technologies. As a result, we may have to\ndevelop alternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently\nmarket to them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law and regulations or our practices\nand platform could be inconsistent with, be alleged to fail, or fail to meet all requirements of, such laws,\nregulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors, merchants, or Dashers on our platform, to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or\ncybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal\ndata or other data relating to merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other individuals, or the perception of privacy\nconcerns or that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation and\nbrand, discourage new and existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers from using our platform, or result in fines,\ninvestigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to legal claims resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to certain risks, including liabilities or\nclaims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of automated\nSMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil claims against\nus. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text messages are\ncontinuously evolving and developing. If we are not able to comply with these laws and regulations, including the\nTCPA, in an effective manner, we could be subject to legal claims and liability, our brand and reputation may be\nharmed, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance\nproviders are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-\nrelated risks including auto liability, employment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business\ninterruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident\nliability for Dashers, and general business liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or risks\nrelated to our new and evolving services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. Even if\nwe do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services, we may\nnot obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured\nretentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it\nwould be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. In addition, if any of our insurance providers\nterminate their relationship with us or refuse to renew their relationships with us on commercially reasonable\nterms, we would be required to find alternate insurance providers and may not be able to secure similar terms or a\nsuitable replacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we\nprocure certain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in\nviolation of the terms of these merchant agreements and could be subject to additional liabilities as a result.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-\ninsured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and\ndeductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could\nincrease substantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are\nrenewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if\n(i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and\ncoverage limits, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to\npay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of\nclaims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\n76\nTable of Contents\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”),\na third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We do not have control\nover the operations of the AWS facilities that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption\nfrom natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of\nmisconduct. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will continue to experience, interruptions,\ndelays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including\ninfrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In\naddition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users on\nour platform. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand. Since our\nplatform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system\nfailures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform, usage of our platform, lead to loss of revenue, increase\nour costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur primary commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate\nthe agreement for convenience by providing us at least 30 days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the\nagreement for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a\n30-day cure period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice.\nAlthough it would be difficult for a number of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more\nalternative cloud infrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms if it became necessary. In the event\nthat our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may\nexperience significant costs or downtime for a short period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of,\nnew cloud infrastructure service providers. However, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of,\nnew cloud infrastructure service providers would cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or\nresults of operations over the longer term.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily PayPal and\nStripe. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our\nrelationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to\nrenew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment\nprocessors and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame.\nFurther, the software and services provided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations,\nmay contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could\ncause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information,\nor make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of\ntime, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and\nadversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, anti-money laundering,\nand similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors, we may be subject\nto claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher\ntransaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could\nmake our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely on data provided by Stripe and other\npayment service provider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other\nerrors in such data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to\ncomply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The\npayment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that\nmight prohibit us from providing certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If\nwe fail to comply with these rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose\nour ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments,\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed\nto reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed\n77\nTable of Contents\nby payment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on accredited third-party background check providers to provide the\ncriminal and/or driving history of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those\nthat are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business\nmay be adversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations,\nor the requirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers\nterminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we\nmay need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an\nacceptable time frame. In certain jurisdictions, including the United States, we currently rely on a single third-\nparty background check provider. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms\nacceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less\nattractive to potential Dashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further,\nif the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise\nmeet our expectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we\nmay be unable to adequately help protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and\nqualified Dashers may be inadvertently excluded from our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our\nreputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been\nconducted, we may not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making\ndeliveries on our platform.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related to notice\nrequirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in\ncertain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct\nsuch background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. If we\nchose background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or if we failed to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the\ndistribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the\nmapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all\nmapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping\nfunctions may not be reliable. Any failure by us to understand and manage our exposure to the risks associated with\nthe use of third party software, such as the risk of misuse of confidential or proprietary information or the\nexposure to cybersecurity incidents, could adversely impact us. For example, integration issues could prevent the\nonboarding of new third party software providers or lead to the loss of existing providers. Furthermore, updates to\nthird party software that integrates with our offerings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as\nit previously had or at all. Any changes in these systems that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives\npreferential treatment to competitive services may impose could adversely affect usage of our platform. From time\nto time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of our third-party software providers. If,\nin connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its relationship\n78\nTable of Contents\nwith us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our platform could\nbe disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and\nDashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software on terms that\nwe believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we\nmay be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not\nbe available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not\ncontrol.\nWe have integrations with PayPal, Stripe, Olo, Google Maps, AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party\napplications, products, and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our\nplatform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of\nour competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform\nwith their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which\nwe, operate and distribute our platform. As our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we\nface to increase. Should any of our competitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards,\nor terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise\nunsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our platform,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within\nsuch application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that\nreduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could\ndecline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If\nsuch mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications\navailable to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications,\ngive preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose\nterms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us,\nor if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than\nthe placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms\nwill continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these\ndevices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed\nto work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful\nin developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’\nexperience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or\nusing our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating\nsystems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, Apple has imposed new requirements\nfor consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and has implemented a new application tracking transparency\nframework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google announced it planned\nto adopt restrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes have, and we expect that\nthese changes will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions. If we are\nunable to mitigate the effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as\nwell as order rates from existing consumers on our platform.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear\nprominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search\nengines\n79\nTable of Contents\nlike Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to how and\nwhere our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its\nranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not\nbe prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of\nconsumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on information from\nthird-party sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such\nsources or the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and\ninformation may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including general expectations\nconcerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size,\nare based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of\nassumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or\nthe methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or\nmethodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, we may lose the confidence of our investors and\nour reputation, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may\ncontinue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly\nleading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims\nbrought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and\nabroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and\nscope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or\nregister our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce\nour proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease\n80\nTable of Contents\nusing intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, such as www.doordash.com and\nwww.wolt.com. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the\napplicable registration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name,\nwhich could cause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain\nname in question. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names due to a variety of reasons. In addition, our\ncompetitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours.\nWe may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to,\nor otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting, maintaining, and\nenforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and\ndiversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source\nlicenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source\nsoftware license. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and\ntime and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected\nportions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and\nresources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software\nuntil we can adequately address the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that\nincorporate open source software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to\nfully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or\nother liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to\n81\nTable of Contents\ncontinue providing our platform on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to\ndiscontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis,\nor to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure,\nacquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic conditions. We believe\nour working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months\nand beyond. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures,\nstrategic initiatives, or investments and our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future\nissuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could\nsuffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges\nsuperior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time,\nand our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans,\nand operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be\nable to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfinancing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our\nbusiness growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to\nrefinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing,\nit may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of March 31, 2023, there\nwere no revolving loans outstanding and $99 million in aggregate face amount of letters of credit issued under our\nrevolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of March 31, 2023, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering,\nand a member of\n82\nTable of Contents\nour board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of our board of\ndirectors collectively held 61% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate, which voting\npower may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards (including those\nequity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to the IPO and subject to equity exchange right agreements whereby\neach of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any shares of Class A common\nstock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or the vesting and\nsettlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common\nstock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had been exercised\nor vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of March 31, 2023, our Co-Founders would collectively\nhold 72% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-Founders have also entered into the Voting\nAgreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of\nClass B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted\ntransferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to\ndetermine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election\nof our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the\napproval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate\ntransaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and\nwhich may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or\ndeterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium\nfor their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class\nA common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause conflicts of\ninterest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us\nto undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or our Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our\nother stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our IPO, which we sometimes refer to\nherein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr.\nXu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person\ndesignated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person, then our secretary then\nin office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days\nfollowing the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180\ndays following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or\nconsultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary\nresignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to\nbe renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of all\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date.\"\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of\nour total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the\noutcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would\nhave no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting\ndilution, which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common\nstock to Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares\nof Class C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has\nbeen met. As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s\ncontrol of our voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most\nmatters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our\nCo-Founders and, in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve\nliquidity\n83\nTable of Contents\nin their holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common\nstock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the NYSE.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the NYSE, we\nexpect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain\nreduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2022, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of the NYSE. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of the voting power\nfor the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and\nmay elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the NYSE regarding corporate governance, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\nthe requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance\nevaluation of the committee; and\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,\nand the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal\nadvisors, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled\ncompany” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these\nexemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the\nNYSE. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with certain of the\ncorporate governance standards of the NYSE, which could adversely affect the protections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it\nwill no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices\ninclude the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P\nComposite 1500. Under such announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible\nfor inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment\nvehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are\nrelatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the long-term valuations of publicly-traded\ncompanies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar\ncompanies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to\ntrack certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds\nand could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\n84\nTable of Contents\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously registered shares for future issuance\nunder our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the\nshares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be\navailable for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\n85\nTable of Contents\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to\nrepurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock\nprice.\nWe have authorized share repurchase programs in the past and may authorize other share repurchase programs in the\nfuture. Under existing or any future share repurchase programs, we may make share repurchases through a variety of\nmethods, including open share market purchases, block transactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in\naccordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our share repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not\nobligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and\nwithout prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price,\nmarket and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements, such as Delaware surplus and\nsolvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have\nannounced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may\nnegatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would\nbe and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance\nlong-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common\nstock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could\nreduce the effectiveness of our repurchase programs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases\nin the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we\ngrant to our employees.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements,\nand we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\n86\nTable of Contents\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and\nrestated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state\nor federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\n87\nTable of Contents\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.\n88\nTable of Contents",
