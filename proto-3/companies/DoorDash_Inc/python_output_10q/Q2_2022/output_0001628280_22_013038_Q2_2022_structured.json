INC.\nNOTES TO CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(Unaudited)\n1. Organization and Description of Business\nDoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”), is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. The\nCompany provides a local commerce platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease\nand immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.\nThe Company’s local commerce platform connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. The Company operates the DoorDash\nMarketplace, which enables merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with\nconsumers (the “Marketplace”). Merchants can fulfill this demand with independent contractors who use the Company’s\nplatform to deliver orders (“Dashers”). As part of the Marketplace, the Company also offers Pickup, which allows\nconsumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees, as well\nas DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on the Company’s platform with large group orders and catering\norders for businesses and events. The Marketplace also includes DashPass, the Company’s membership product, which\nprovides consumers with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees. In\naddition to the Marketplace, the Company offers Platform Services, which primarily includes DoorDash Drive\n(\"Drive\"), a white-label delivery fulfillment service that enables merchants that have generated consumer demand\nthrough their own channels to fulfill this demand using the Company’s platform, and DoorDash Storefront\n(\"Storefront\"), that enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with\na turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or\nfulfillment capabilities.\n2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of DoorDash, Inc. and\nits wholly-owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in\nthe United States of America (“GAAP”) and the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the\n“SEC”) for interim reporting. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that\nare, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. They should be\nread in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results for a full year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make\ncertain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\nrelated disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances\nfor credit losses, gift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and\nwebsite development costs, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and other\nfinancial instruments, valuation of acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied\nin lease accounting, insurance reserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could\ndiffer from these estimates.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies from its Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\n11\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") issued Accounting Standard Update (\"ASU\")\n2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts\nwith Customers, which requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and\ncontract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 606. ASU 2021-08 is\neffective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is permitted. The Company is in the\nprocess of evaluating the impact of the adoption of the update on its consolidated financial statements.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomprised of Marketplace (which includes Pickup and DoorDash for Work) and Drive.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of DashPass, the\naddress of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2021        2022\nUnited States    $                         1,072    $  1,445\nInternational                                  5          11\nTotal revenue    $                         1,077    $  1,456\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets, is primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from\nconsumers and merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized\nover time. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 was as\nfollows (in millions):\nContract Liabilities\nBeginning balance                          $                   183\nAddition to contract liabilities                               407\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                       -418\nEnding balance                             $                   172\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplace. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 68million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, of which $ 42million was recognized as revenue during the three months ended March 31,\n2022.\n12\nTable of Contents\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance\nsheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing\nexpense and amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of\nrevenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations. A\nsummary of activities related to deferred contract costs was as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2021       2022\nBeginning balance                          $                            43    $    62\nCapitalization of deferred contract                                      6         13\ncosts\nAmortization of deferred contract costs                                 -5         -6\nEnding balance                             $                            44    $    69\nDeferred contract costs, current           $                            17    $    27\nDeferred contract costs, non-current                                    27         42\nTotal deferred contract costs              $                            44    $    69\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses related to accounts receivable and changes were as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2021       2022\nBeginning balance                          $                            13    $    39\nAdditions to the provision for expected                                 16          2\ncredit losses\nWriteoffs charged against the allowance                                 -1         -4\nEnding balance                             $                            28    $    37\n4. Acquisition\nBbot Acquisition\nOn March 1, 2022, the Company acquired Bbot, Inc., a hospitality technology company. The addition of Bbot's\nproducts and technology to the Company's platform will offer merchants more solutions for their in-store and online\nchannels, including in-store digital ordering and payments. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition\nmethod of accounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $ 88million in cash, including a $\n9million indemnification holdback, which was recorded in other liabilities.\nThe total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities\nassumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The excess of the purchase\nprice over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the anticipated\nsynergies from the future growth opportunities from the adoption of Bbot’s technology by the Company’s merchants.\nThe fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s best estimate and assumptions,\nand are considered preliminary pending finalization of the valuation analyses pertaining to assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed, which primarily relate to acquired intangible assets. The measurement period will end no later\nthan one-year from the acquisition date.\n13\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMarch 1, 2022\nCurrent assets          $             11\nIntangible assets                     18\nGoodwill                              60\nOther liabilities                     -1\nTotal purchase price    $             88\nThe intangible assets acquired consisted of existing technology and customer relationships, which had estimated\nremaining useful lives of 5and 3years as of the date of the acquisition, respectively.\nThe acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\n5.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has been and continues to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification,\nand such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex\nOperations West, Inc. v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”) . The California Legislature passed legislation (“AB 5”), that\nwas signed into law\n17\nTable of Contents\nin September 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor\nclassification, expanded its application and created numerous carve-outs, which may have an adverse effect on the\nCompany’s business, financial condition, and results of operations, and may lead to increased legal proceedings and\nrelated expenses and may require the Company to significantly alter its existing business model and operations.\nFurther, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to\ndetermine worker classification.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nconducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices, the\nclassification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, and other matters. For example, the\nCompany is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of California for payroll tax\nliabilities. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors,\nand thus plans to vigorously contest any adverse assessment or determination. The Company’s chances of success on\nthe merits is uncertain.\nIn November 2019 the Company filed an agreement to pay $ 40million with the representatives of Dashers that had\nfiled certain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under the Private Attorney General\nAct and class action claims alleging worker misclassification of Dashers against the Company. These actions were\nfiled by and on behalf of Massachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and\nCalifornia Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since August 2016. The Company entered into several amended\nsettlement agreements to increase the total amount to be paid by the Company, including a final settlement\nagreement in April 2021, which increased the total amount to be paid by the Company to $ 100million. In January\n2022, the settlement received final approval and the Company anticipates the payout of $ 100million in 2022.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees\nin violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This\naction is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the Company from continuing\nto classify Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred;\nhowever, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company indemnifies, holds harmless, and agrees to reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third-party with respect to its technology. The terms of these\nindemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement. The maximum\npotential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements.\nThe Company has entered into or will enter into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of the\nindividual.\nNoliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement which provides for a $\n300million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on November 19, 2024. Loans under the credit facility bear\ninterest, at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of\nthe federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted LIBOR rate for a\none-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is\nalso obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit\nfees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative\ncovenants, such as financial statement reporting requirements and restrictions on the use of proceeds, as well as\ncustomary negative covenants that restrict its ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur\nadditional indebtedness, incur liens, declare cash dividends in the entirety or make certain other distributions,\nmerge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of its assets, make investments, loans and\nacquisitions, and engage in transactions with affiliates.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIn August 2020, the Company amended and restated its existing revolving credit and guaranty agreement to provide\nfor $ 100million of incremental revolving loan commitments, effective upon the consummation of an initial public\noffering of the Company’s common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021, for total revolving commitments of $\n400million. The amendment and restatement also extended the maturity date for the revolving credit facility from\nNovember 19, 2024 to August 7, 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit\nagreement. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, noamounts were drawn from the credit facility.\nThe Company maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 60million and $ 80million of issued letters of credit\noutstanding, respectively, of which $ 39million and $ 59million, respectively, were issued from the revolving\ncredit and guaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state and local tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect tax\nmatters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves when they become probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may\ndiffer from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months the Company will\nreceive additional assessments by various tax authorities in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments could\nresult in changes to the Company's reserves related to positions on sales and indirect tax filings.\n9. Common Stock\n2014 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn March 2014, the Company adopted the 2014 Stock Option Plan, as amended (the \"2014 Plan\"), which provided for the\ngranting of stock options to employees, consultants, and advisors of the Company. Options granted under the 2014\nPlan are either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. Options under the 2014 Plan were granted at\nprices no less than 100% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of grant as determined by the\nCompany’s board of directors; provided, however, that the exercise price of an incentive stock option granted to a\ngreater than 10% stockholder could not be less than 110% of the estimated fair value of the shares on the date of\ngrant. Options granted generally vest over four years.\nThe 2014 Plan allowed for the early exercise of options. Under the terms of the 2014 Plan, option holders, upon\nearly exercise, were required to sign a restricted stock purchase agreement that gave the Company the right to\nrepurchase any unvested shares, at the original exercise price, in the event the grantees’ employment terminated\nfor any reason. The repurchase right lapses over time as the shares vest at the same rate as the original option\nvesting schedule. Stock-based awards forfeited, cancelled, or repurchased generally were returned to the pool of\nshares of common stock available for issuance.\nIn connection with the Company's initial public offering (the \"IPO\"), the 2014 Plan was terminated effective\nimmediately prior to the effectiveness of the 2020 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2020 Plan\") and the Company ceased\ngranting any additional awards under the 2014 Plan. All outstanding awards under the 2014 Plan at the time of the\ntermination of the 2014 Plan remain subject to the terms of the 2014 Plan, and any shares underlying stock options\nthat expire or terminate or are forfeited or repurchased by the Company under the 2014 Plan were automatically\ntransferred to the 2020 Plan.\n2020 Equity Incentive Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020 Plan,\nwhich became effective onebusiness day prior to the effective date of the Company's IPO registration statement. The\n2020 Plan provides for the granting of nonstatutory stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units\n(\"RSUs\"), stock appreciation rights, performance units, and performance shares for the Company's Class A common\nstock to the Company's employees, directors, and consultants.

The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service\ncondition and achievement of certain stock price goals. As of March 31, 2022, unrecognized stock-based compensation\nexpense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 262million, which is expected to be recognized over a period of\n3.07years.\nAs of March 31, 2022, there was $ 1.6billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested\nRSUs, excluding the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the CEO Performance Award granted\nin November 2020. The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average period of\n2.62years.\n2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn November 2020, the Company's board of directors adopted, and the Company's stockholders approved, the 2020\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"ESPP\"), which became effective on the business day immediately prior to the\neffective date of the Company's IPO registration statement. A total of 6,498,600shares of Class A common stock were\ninitially reserved for sale under the ESPP. The number of shares of Class A common stock available for issuance\nunder the ESPP will be increased on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year following the\nfiscal year in which the first enrollment date (if any) occurs equal to the least of (i) 6,498,600shares of Class A\ncommon stock, (ii) one and one-half percent ( 1.5%) of the outstanding shares of all classes of common stock on the\nlast day of the immediately preceding fiscal year, or (iii) an amount determined by the administrator of the ESPP.\nSubject to any limitations contained therein, the ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute (in the form of\npayroll deductions or otherwise to the extent permitted by the administrator) an amount established by the\nadministrator from time to time in its discretion to purchase Class A common stock at a discounted price per share.\nAs of March 31, 2022, there had been nooffering period or purchase period under the ESPP, and no such period will\nbegin unless and until determined by the administrator.\n10. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate,\nadjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate\nof the annual effective tax rate and, if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a\ncumulative adjustment in such period.\nThe Company recorded $ 1million and zero of provision for income taxes for the three months ended March 31, 2021\nand 2022, respectively. The provision for income taxes presented were primarily attributable to state franchise\ntaxes and income taxes in foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance\nif it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. The\nCompany evaluates\n21\nTable of Contents\nand weighs all available evidence, both positive and negative, including its historic operating results, future\nreversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, as well as projected future taxable income. The Company will\ncontinue to regularly assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets. Changes in earnings performance and\nfuture earnings projections, among other factors, may cause the Company to adjust the valuation allowance on\ndeferred tax assets, which could materially impact the income tax expense in the period the Company determines that\nthese factors have changed. As of March 31, 2022, the Company continues to maintain a full valuation allowance on\nits deferred tax assets except in certain foreign jurisdictions.\nAs of March 31, 2022, the Company had $ 71million of unrecognized tax benefits, which, if recognized, the majority\nof which would result in adjustments to the valuation allowance. The Company is subject to income tax audits in the\nUnited States and in foreign jurisdictions. The Company recorded liabilities related to uncertain tax positions and\nbelieves that the Company has provided adequate reserves for income tax uncertainties in all open tax years. Due to\nthe Company’s history of tax losses, all years remain open to tax audits.\n11. Net Loss per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net loss per share attributable to common stockholders using the two-class method required for\nmultiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the liquidation and dividend\nrights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than voting rights. Accordingly,\nthe Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net losses.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net loss per share attributable to common\nstockholders during the periods presented. RSUs that vested but have not been settled are included in the\ndenominator in calculating net loss per share for the three months ended March 31, 2022 (in millions, except share\namounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n2021                        2022\nClass A       Class B       Class A       Class B\nNet loss                              $                           -99    $      -11    $     -152    $      -15\nWeighted-average number of shares\noutstanding used to compute net                               296,498        31,317       318,086        31,133\nloss per\nshare, basic and diluted\nNet loss per share, basic and         $                         -0.34    $    -0.34    $    -0.48    $    -0.48\ndiluted\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet loss per share because including them would have had an anti-dilutive effect, or issuance of such shares is\ncontingent upon the satisfaction of certain performance or market conditions which were not satisfied at the end of\nthe respective periods (in thousands):\nAs of March 31,\n2021      2022\nStock options to purchase common stock             27,812    16,425\nUnvested restricted stock units                    27,491    27,422\nTotal                                              55,303    43,847",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 . This discussion contains forward-looking statements that\ninvolve risks and uncertainties. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those\nidentified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and other sections of this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for\nany period in the future.\n22\nTable of Contents\nOverview\nWe have built a local commerce platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease\nand immediacy. We built our products to serve the needs of three key constituents: merchants, consumers, and\nDashers. We do this primarily through our Marketplace, which offers a broad array of services that enable merchants\nto solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order fulfillment,\nmerchandising, payment processing, and customer support. Our Marketplace enables merchants to establish an online\npresence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand\nthrough delivery, generally facilitated by our platform, or in-person pickup by consumers. We also enable merchants\nto advertise and promote on our platform in order to acquire new consumers and drive incremental sales.\nIn addition to our Marketplace, which accounts for the vast majority of our revenue today, our Platform Services\nbusiness, which primarily consists of Drive and Storefront, offers services to help merchants facilitate sales\nthrough their own channels. Drive, our white-label delivery fulfillment service, enables merchants to fulfill\nconsumer demand generated through their own channels using our platform. Storefront enables merchants to create\ntheir own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand\naccess to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or fulfillment capabilities.\nWe currently operate our business in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Japan, and Germany.\nKey Business and Non-GAAP Metrics\nIn addition to the measures presented in our condensed consolidated financial statements, we use the following key\nbusiness and non-GAAP metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting our business, formulate\nbusiness plans, and make strategic decisions:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions, except percentages)                                   2021            2022\nTotal Orders                                                         329             404\nMarketplace GOV                          $                         9,913       $  12,353\nContribution Profit(1)                   $                           209       $     319\nContribution Margin(1)                                                19  %           22  %\nContribution Profit as a % of                                          2  %            3  %\nMarketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                       $                            43       $      54\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin(1)                                              4  %            4  %\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                                  —  %            —  %\nGOV\n(1) Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin are non-GAAP financial\nmeasures. For more information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations to the most directly\ncomparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial\nMeasures\".\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed on the DoorDash platform, including those completed\nthrough our Marketplace and Platform Services businesses, over the period of measurement.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Total Orders increased to 404 million, or 23% growth compared to the same quarter of\n2021. The increase in Total Orders was driven primarily by growth in consumers and increased consumer engagement.\nMarketplace GOV . We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplace,\nincluding taxes, tips, and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass. Marketplace\norders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does not include the dollar\nvalue of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through Drive and Storefront.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Marketplace GOV increased to $12.4 billion, or 25% growth compared to the same\nquarter of 2021, driven primarily by the growth in Total Orders.\n23\nTable of Contents\nContribution Profit (Loss). We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and\nmarketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses,\nand (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses. Gross profit (loss) is\ndefined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and\namortization related to cost of revenue. We define Contribution Margin as Contribution Profit (Loss) as a\npercentage of revenue for the same period.\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn the first quarter of 2022 , Contribution Profit increased to $319 million, compared to $209 million in the same\nquarter of 2021, driven primarily by growth in Marketplace GOV . Contribution Margin increased to 22% in the first\nquarter of 2022 from 19% in the same quarter of 2021 .\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It\ndoes not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain\nexpenses that are reflected in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance.\nFurther, it is not a financial measure of total company profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a\nproxy for total company profitability nor does it imply profitability for our business.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss), adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and\nregulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-\nrelated costs, (iv) impairment expenses, (v) provision for income taxes, (vi) interest income and expense, (vii)\nother income (expense), net, (viii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (ix)\ndepreciation and amortization expense. Adjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating\nperformance and the operating leverage in our business. Adjusted EBITDA Margin is calculated by dividing Adjusted\nEBITDA by revenue for the same period.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $54 million from $43 million in the same quarter of\n2021, driven primarily by growth in Marketplace GOV. In the first quarter of 2022, Adjusted EBITDA Margin remained\nflat at 4% compared to the same quarter of 2021 .\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplace and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our\nMarketplace to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our Marketplace to arrange\nfor delivery services. We recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an agent for both\npartner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects commissions charged to partner merchants and fees\ncharged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which includes certain\ndiscounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer. Revenue from our\nMarketplace is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of our\nMarketplace revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the\ncontractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the\nconsumer.\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Platform Services business, which primarily\nconsists of our Drive and Storefront offerings. We generate revenue from Drive by collecting per-order fees from\nmerchants to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from\nDrive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\n24\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of\nrebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, insurance expenses, and costs\nrelated to placing orders with non-partner merchants, and costs related to first party product sales, for which we\ntake control of inventory, (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding merchants and Dashers, costs for\nproviding support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform infrastructure costs, and (iii)\npersonnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to our local operations, support,\nand other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses primarily include salary, bonus,\nbenefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined based on an allocation of shared\ncosts, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information technology costs, among all departments\nbased on employee headcount.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant,\nconsumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the\nreferrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing\nexpenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense\nincluding amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data\nanalytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to our platform, as well as expenses\nassociated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include\nlitigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to\nadministrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated\nwith fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, transaction-related costs, bad debt expense,\nand allocated overhead.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with\nour property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation primarily includes expenses associated with\nequipment for merchants, computer equipment and software, office equipment, and leasehold improvements.\nAmortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized software and website development costs, as well as\nacquired intangible assets.\nInterest Income\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense consists of interest costs related to our revolving credit facility and payment-in-kind interest\non our Convertible Notes issued in February 2020.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net primarily consists of gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the\nfunctional currency.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes primarily consists of U.S. federal and state income tax and franchise tax, as well as\ninternational taxes from foreign operations.\n25\nTable of

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures\nprovide useful information to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall\nunderstanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to\nmetrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP\nfinancial measures to assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of\nmanagement, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors\nto use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our\nindustry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense,\nadjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss),\nContribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin\nshould be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance\nwith GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to\nreview our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single\nfinancial measure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research\nand development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution\nMargin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin in conjunction\nwith their respective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and allocated overhead.

These excluded\ncosts and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii)\nreserves for the collection of sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii)\ncosts related to the settlement of an intellectual property matter, (iv) expenses related to supporting various\npolicy matters, including those related to worker classification and price controls, and (v) donations as part of\nour relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is\nappropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense\nbecause (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting\nor forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such\nexpenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative\nand regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 and similar legislation.\nContribution Profit (Loss)\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution\nProfit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into\naccount the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.

These excluded costs and expenses consist\nof (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii) reserves for the collection of\nsales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) costs related to the settlement\nof an intellectual property matter, (iv) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including those\nrelated to worker classification and price controls, and (v) donations as part of our relief efforts in connection\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing\nmatters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are\nunpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker\nclassification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of\noperations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area,\nincluding as a result of Proposition 22 and similar legislation.\n32\nTable of Contents\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions, except percentages)                               2021           2022\nRevenue                              $                         1,077       $  1,456\nNet loss                             $                          -110       $   -167\nNet margin                                                       -10  %         -12  %\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions, except percentages)                               2021           2022\nRevenue                              $                         1,077       $  1,456\nAdjusted EBITDA                      $                            43       $     54\nAdjusted EBITDA Margin                                             4  %           4  %\nCredit Facilities\nOn November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an\naffiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs &\nCo. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, provides for a $300 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility maturing on August 7, 2025, increasing to $400 million in aggregate revolving commitments upon the\nconsummation of an initial public offering of our common stock on or prior to August 7, 2021. Loans under the\ncredit facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted\nLIBOR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin equal to 1.00%.\nWe are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of\ncredit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of March 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the\ncovenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, no amounts\nwere drawn from the credit facility.\nWe maintain letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December\n31, 2021 and March 31, 2022, we had $60 million and $80 million of issued letters of credit outstanding,\nrespectively, of which $39 million and $59 million were issued from the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIn December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of shares of\nour Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\nAs of March 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of\n$4.2 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2.2 billion, short-term marketable securities of\n$1.4 billion and long-term marketable securities of $643 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors of\n$293 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and consumers,\nas well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on\ndeposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds and U.S. Treasury securities. Marketable securities\nconsisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. Treasury securities.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $2.2\nbillion as of March 31, 2022. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may\nincur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may\nrequire additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities,\nalong with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be\nsufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nOur material cash requirements relate to operating lease obligations for corporate office facility leases and\npurchase commitments for purchase of onboarding, technology platform infrastructure services and advertising\nservices.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in\n33\nTable of Contents\nthe future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products, services, and technologies. We may\nbe required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from\noutside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise\nadditional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nThree Months Ended March 31,\n(In millions)                                                          2021       2022\nNet cash provided by (used in) operating    $                           166    $   -20\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                                    -7       -246\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing                               -496          5\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                     —          1\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet decrease in cash, cash equivalents,     $                          -337    $  -260\nand restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash used in operating activities was $20 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022.

The change in cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2022 compared\nto the three months ended March 31, 2021 was mainly due to the net changes in operating assets and liabilities for\nthe three months ended March 31, 2022.\nCash provided by operating activities was $166 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021.

The\nnet changes in operating assets and liabilities was the result of a decrease of $79 million in prepaid expenses and\nother current assets, an increase of $27 million in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, primarily\nrelated to litigation reserves, sales tax payable and accrued sales and indirect taxes, accrued operations related\nexpenses, Dasher and merchant payable, and contract liabilities, and a decrease of $19 million in funds held at\npayment processors, offset by a decrease of $8 million for payments for operating lease liabilities, an increase of\n$7 million in accounts receivable, net, and an increase of $4 million in other assets.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $246 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, which primarily\nconsisted of cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $71 million, purchases of marketable securities of\n$656 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $39 million and purchases of\nproperty and equipment of $32 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable\nsecurities of $552 million,\nCash used in investing activities was $7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which primarily\nconsisted of purchases of marketable securities of $99 million, purchases of property and equipment of $32 million,\nand cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $22 million, offset by proceeds from\nthe sales and maturities of marketable securities of $146 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022, which was the\nproceeds from exercise of stock options.\n34\nTable of Contents\nCash used in financing activities was $496 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021, which consisted of\n$333 million of repayment of the convertible notes, $166 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net\nshare settlement of equity awards, and $10 million of payment of deferred offering costs, offset by $13 million of\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements,\nas well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nActual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our\nestimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flows could be affected.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates as described in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.",

          "content": "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade debt\nsecurities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are\nrecorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax\nreported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of March 31, 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest\nrates would not have materially affected our condensed consolidated financial statements. We currently do not hedge\nthese interest rate exposures.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe conduct business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily Canadian dollars and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income and loss from our\ninternational businesses included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations. A continued strengthening\nof the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included\nin our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) which is part of stockholders’ equity.\n35\nTable of Contents",

Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a\nreasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 that\nhave materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n36\nTable of Contents",

Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a\nmaterial loss in excess of the amount recorded.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of third-party delivery providers on our\nplatform as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various\nlabor and other laws that would apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and\nclassification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various\nauthorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought\nunder PAGA and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the\nclassification of third-party delivery providers on our platform as independent contractors.\nIn November 2019, we filed an agreement to pay $40 million with the representatives of Dashers that had filed\ncertain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging\nworker misclassification of Dashers (the \"Marciano settlement\"). These actions were filed by and on behalf of\nMassachusetts Dashers that utilized the DoorDash platform since September 2014 and California Dashers that utilized\nthe DoorDash platform since August 2016. The settlement was filed with the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco and the court issued a tentative ruling raising certain issues with the filed settlement agreement\nand requesting supplemental briefing from the parties. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual\nReport on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 for additional information regarding the subsequent\nproceedings related to the Marciano settlement. Ultimately, in light of the court’s concerns about the Marciano\nsettlement, the parties agreed to withdraw the Marciano settlement and instead present a new proposed settlement in\nMarko v DoorDash, Inc., Case No. BC659841 (Los Angeles Super. Ct.). In April 2021, plaintiffs filed a revised\nsettlement agreement with the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles (the \"Marko settlement\"). The\ntotal amount to be paid by us under the Marko settlement is $100 million. In January 2022, the court granted final\napproval of the Marko settlement which resolves claims under PAGA and claims alleging worker misclassification for\nDashers in California for the period of August 30, 2016 through December 31, 2020 and claims alleging worker\nmisclassification for Dashers in Massachusetts for the period of September 26, 2014 through March 31, 2021.\nVarious other delivery providers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their\nclassification on our platform, as an independent contractor under federal and state law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual delivery\nproviders, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our\nindependent contractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code\nand the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary\ndamages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as independent\ncontractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is\nnot estimable given the status of the case.\n37\nTable of Contents\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including Canada and Australia. New laws and\nregulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in\nresponse to our industry and related technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was\nsigned into law in September 2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard\nregarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with\ncertain other companies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative titled Proposition 22 to\naddress AB 5 and preserve flexibility for delivery providers, which passed in November 2020, and which became\neffective in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor\ngroups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County Superior Court to compel the State of California not\nto enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as unconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the\nAlameda County Superior Court issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The\nCalifornia Attorney General, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of\nProposition 22 have filed appeals in the California Court of Appeal. Proposition 22 remains in effect pending\nfurther court proceedings.\nIn addition, several other states where we operate may adopt legislation similar to Proposition 22, which we would\nexpect to increase our costs in such jurisdictions, could result in lower order volumes if we charge higher fees\nand commissions as a result of such laws, and could also adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the\npassage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation have been and may in the future\nbe challenged and subject to litigation. Additionally, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards\nsimilar to AB 5 to determine worker classification.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nthe Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty and/or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to\ndefend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our\nbusiness practices, the classification and compensation of delivery providers, the Dasher pay model, compliance\nwith consumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation\ninsurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of\nthe State of California for payroll tax liabilities. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related\ngovernmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit,\nor inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly\nin the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or\nother action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs\nassociated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources,\nand other factors.\n38\nTable of Contents\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving delivery\nproviders who have been active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters\nrelated to accidents or other incidents involving delivery providers that utilize our platform. In many of these\nmatters, we believe we have meritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or\nincidents that individually, in our opinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and\nlegal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an\nadverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of\nmanagement resources, and other factors.\n39\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nincluding the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nClass A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed\nby risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of\nthe risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be\nadversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose\npart or all of your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future;\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nIf Dashers in the United States are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, or if we fail to comply\nwith Proposition 22 in the State of California, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would\nbe adversely affected;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and failure by them to maintain their\nservice levels or any changes to their operating costs could adversely affect our business;\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses for legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business;\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand the costs of complying with such laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations,\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue,\nTotal Orders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline\nas the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic wane;\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (the \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n40\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval;\nThe proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\") will not be completed unless the conditions are satisfied or\nwaived. If the Transaction is not completed, our and Wolt’s future business and financial results could be\nnegatively affected;\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt may subject us to certain liabilities associated with Wolt or\nliabilities that may arise in connection with the completion of the Transaction; and\nOur and Wolt’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the\nTransaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and Wolt's results of operations, cash flows, and financial\nposition.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed\nour pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate\nour future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability\nto:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and enter new markets and geographies;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment of new features and services;\nhire, integrate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical\nfinancial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future revenue and expenses may\nnot be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market.\nWe have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced\nby growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding\nthese risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do\nnot address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nAlthough we generated net income of $23 million for the three months ended June 30, 2020, we have incurred net\nlosses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nachieve profitability again, or maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $110\nmillion and $159 million in the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively, and, as of December 31,\n2021 and March 31, 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. We expect\nour costs will increase over time\n41\nTable of Contents\nand our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and\noperating as a public company. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other\nresources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new\nplatform features and services, expanding into new markets and geographies, and increasing our sales and marketing\nefforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in increased revenue or growth in our\nbusiness. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses\ncould prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we\nare unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our RSUs and other outstanding equity awards will\nresult in increases in our expenses in future periods. As of March 31, 2022, we had $1,881 million of unrecognized\nstock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards. Additionally, we may expend\nsubstantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations that arise upon the initial\nsettlement of certain of our RSUs.\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant\nlosses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain or increase profitability.\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our recent revenue growth rate, growth in demand\nfor our offerings, and financial performance should not be considered indicative of our future performance. For the\nthree months ended March 31, 2021 and 2022, our revenue was $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively,\nrepresenting an 35% year-over-year growth rate. In addition, with the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a\nsignificant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. The circumstances that accelerated the growth\nof our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to continue, and we expect growth\nin consumer demand and our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline in future periods\ncompared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any\nprevious quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key\nbusiness metrics growth in future periods. In particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods.\nWe expect our revenue growth rate to continue to fluctuate over the short term and decline in the long term. Our\nrevenue growth rate may decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021 as the size of our\nbusiness grows and as we achieve higher market adoption rates. We may also experience declines in our revenue\ngrowth rate as a result of a number of factors, including slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in\nthe number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing competition, a decrease in\nthe growth of our overall market, our failure to continue to capitalize on growth opportunities, increasing\nregulatory costs, and the maturation of our business, among others. We also expect to continue to make investments\nin the development and expansion of our business, which may not result in increased revenue or growth. In addition,\nwe have strategically focused on suburban markets and smaller metropolitan areas since our founding because of the\nopportunity that these markets have presented for our local commerce platform. If the demand for local commerce\nplatforms does not continue to grow in these markets, or if we are unable to maintain our category share in these\nmarkets, our revenue growth rate could be adversely affected. If our revenue growth rate declines, investors’\nperceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local on-demand delivery,\nthe largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. In the United States, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Grubhub (acquired by Just Eat Takeaway in\nJune 2021), and Postmates (acquired by Uber in December 2020), chain merchants that have their own online ordering\nplatforms, pizza companies, such as Domino’s, online ordering systems, other merchants that own and operate their\nown delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and\nmerchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with large Internet\ncompanies with substantial resources, users, and brand power, such as Amazon and Google. Further, as we continue to\nexpand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets. In\naddition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper\nmenus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to\nattract consumers. Changing traditional ordering habits is difficult, and if merchants and consumers do not embrace\nthe transition to local on-demand delivery as we expect or do not continue to use local on-demand delivery, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established\nrelationships with local merchants and larger existing user bases in certain markets, more successful marketing\ncapabilities, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. Greater financial\nresources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly to new or\nemerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less\nattractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic\nmarket, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and\nsupply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less\nappealing to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic\nrelationships among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, Uber acquired Postmates in\nDecember 2020, and Just Eat Takeaway, a European local commerce platform, acquired Grubhub in June 2021, and Lyft\nannounced a partnership with Grubhub that allows Lyft’s loyalty-program members free delivery from Grubhub\nrestaurants. In addition, certain of our competitors have acquired kitchens to enable them to produce and deliver\nfood directly to consumers. Our competitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and\nperformance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than ours.\nAdditionally, many of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission\nrates and consumer fees, incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services and consumer\ndiscounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, which may be more\nattractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission\nrates and fees or maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions in order to remain competitive,\nparticularly in markets where we do not have a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will\ncontinue to negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be\nsuccessful. Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of\nfunding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These\ninvestments, along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to\nlower their prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more\neffectively against us. Local on-demand delivery services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are\nnascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to\nachieve, maintain or increase profitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost effective to\ndevelop their own platforms to offer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIn addition, within our industry, the cost to switch between offerings is low. Consumers have a propensity to shift\nto the lowest-cost provider and could use more than one local commerce platform, independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. In addition, our competitors may\nadopt certain of our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more\nhighly than ours, which would render our platform less attractive and reduce our ability to differentiate our\nplatform. Increased competition could result in, among other\n43\nTable of Contents\nthings, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the\nfrequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow\nour platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in\nnew markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers\nattracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or than it has grown\nin the past. In particular, our national brand partnerships are a key component of our strategy to provide a wide\nselection for consumers. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants\nand our national brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. In addition, we expect\nto continue to incur substantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our\noperations into new markets to acquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar\ncompetitive environments, and we may invest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such\ninvestments will not be achieved for several years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the\nmerchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Based on the type of partner agreement, partner merchants may terminate\ntheir agreements with us by providing us at least seven (7) or thirty (30) days advance notice and such agreements\ndo not generally provide for any exclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements\nwith us, the merchant selection available on our local commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to\nour business and to our relationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and\nretain other constituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership product, DashPass, and how\ncompelling this offering is to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to DashPass.\nAdditionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as\ndiscounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such\nconsumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of DashPass, through\nprompts and notifications and time-limited trials of DashPass and other offerings. However, these consumers may\nnever convert to a paid membership to DashPass or access our platform after they take advantage of our promotions.\nIf we are not able to continue to expand our consumer base or fail to convert our consumers to regular paying\nconsumers, demand for our full-price or paid services, such as DashPass, and our revenue may grow slower than\nexpected or decline.\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites\nand applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and\napplications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If\nconsumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than\nthrough our website and consumer mobile application directly, our ability to establish relationships and build\nbrand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized\nexperience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract\nand retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n44\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. To attract and retain\nDashers, we have, among other things, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, such as credits to be used for\norders on our platform, free DoorDash-branded apparel, discounted equipment, tips and assistance using the Dasher\napp, and access to programs that provide cashback rewards on certain purchases, including gasoline. If we do not\ncontinue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform, compelling opportunities to earn income, and other\nincentive programs that are comparable or superior to those of our competitors, we may fail to attract new Dashers\nor retain existing Dashers or increase their use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative\npublicity, or other work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. For example, if\nmerchants and consumers choose to use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to\nearn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers.\nWe also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these\nincentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers or\ncould have other unintended adverse consequences. In addition, changes in certain laws and regulations, including\nimmigration and labor and employment laws, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in\nincreased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our\ncontrol, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers\nthat utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. Our agreements with Dashers generally remain in\neffect until terminated by Dashers or us. Dashers may terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least\nseven (7) days advance notice and such agreements do not provide for any exclusivity. If we fail to attract Dashers\nor retain existing Dashers on favorable terms, if we fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers,\nor if Dashers terminate their agreements with us, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain\ntheir service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, either as a result of increased\noperating costs, or to offset the commission we charge, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform, including small and local independent businesses, to provide quality goods to\nour consumers at expected price points. If these merchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand,\nproducing quality goods at affordable prices, or meeting our other requirements or standards, or experience\nproblems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, our reputation and brand could be damaged. Further, an\nincrease in merchant operating costs could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission\nrates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our operational costs and efficiency, and if\nmerchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide\nconsumers with sufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform.\nMany of the factors affecting merchant operating costs, including off-premise costs and prices, are beyond the\ncontrol of merchants and include inflation, costs associated with the goods provided, labor and employee benefit\ncosts, rent costs, and energy costs. If merchants pass along these increased operating costs and increase prices on\nour platform, order volume may decline. Additionally, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “ Risk Factors ”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\n45\nTable of Contents\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nour business mix between Marketplace and Drive;\nthe proportion of consumers that are members of DashPass;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal\npatterns in restaurant dining;\nthe impact of weather on our business;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to\nmerchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe attraction and engagement of qualified employees and key personnel;\nour ability to choose and effectively manage third-party service providers;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer behavior and our order\nvolumes, as well as the impact of changes in the response of governments and private industry to COVID-19;\nthe impact that price controls on local commerce platforms imposed by various jurisdictions, and any associated\nincrease in the fees we charge to consumers, have on our operating results;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our website, mobile application, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other\n46\nTable of Contents\ncyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power\nlosses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks,\ncomputer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage,\ntheft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. Some of our systems are not fully\nredundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption\ninsurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a\nresult of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time\nto time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These\nsystem failures generally occur either as a result of software updates being deployed with unexpected errors or as\na result of temporary infrastructure failures related to storage, network, or compute capacity being exhausted.\nThese events have resulted in losses in revenue, though such losses have not been material to date. System failures\nin the future could result in significant losses of revenue. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided\ncredits to consumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar\nevent, including for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may\nvoluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, the affected user could seek monetary recourse\nfrom us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to\naddress. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the\navailability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and\ncould result in the loss of users.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar public health threat, could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. With the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total\nOrders, and Marketplace GOV. We expect our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline as\nthe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic wane.\nThe current outbreak of COVID-19 has globally resulted in loss of life, business closures, restrictions on travel,\nand widespread cancellation of social gatherings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or recovery from the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, impacts our business is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Factors that may\nimpact our business include:\nnew information which may emerge concerning the severity of the disease;\nthe duration and spread of the outbreak;\nthe severity of travel restrictions imposed by geographic areas in which we operate, mandatory or voluntary\nbusiness closures;\nregulatory actions taken in response to the pandemic, which may impact merchant operations, consumer and merchant\npricing, Dasher pay, and our product offerings;\nother business disruptions that affect our workforce;\nthe availability of effective vaccines and the speed at which they can be administered to the public;\nthe continued emergence of new strains of COVID-19;\nthe impact on capital and financial markets;\nactions taken throughout the world, including in markets in which we operate, to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or\ntreat its impact, and;\npotential changes to consumer behavior or spending patterns as markets recover.\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we have allowed many of our employees to work remotely, which may impact\nproductivity and otherwise disrupt our business operations. In addition, the current outbreak of COVID-19 has\nresulted in a widespread global health crisis and adversely affected global economies and financial markets, and\nsimilar public health threats could do so in the future. Such events have impacted, and could in the future impact,\ndemand for merchants and consumer purchase patterns, which in turn, could adversely affect our revenue and results\nof operations.\nWith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace\nGOV due to increased consumer demand for delivery, more merchants using our platform to facilitate both delivery\nand take-out, and improved efficiency of our local on-demand delivery platform. The circumstances that have\naccelerated the growth of our business stemming from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to\ncontinue, and we expect our\n47\nTable of Contents\nrevenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to decline in future periods compared to growth rates in\n2020 and 2021.\nFurthermore, if a virus or other disease is transmitted by human contact, as is the case with COVID-19, our\nemployees and any constituent of our network may become infected, or may choose, or be advised, to avoid any\ncontact with others, any of which may adversely affect our ability to provide our platform and for merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers to use our platform. In addition, shelter-in-place orders and similar regulations impact\nmerchants’ ability to operate their businesses, consumers’ ability to pick up orders, and Dashers’ ability to make\ndeliveries during certain times, or at all. Viruses or other diseases transmitted by human contact may in the\nfuture cause a temporary closure of merchants’ businesses, either due to government mandate or voluntary\npreventative measures, and many of our merchants may not be able to withstand prolonged interruptions to their\nbusinesses, and may be forced to go out of business. Even if merchants are able to continue to operate their\nbusinesses, many may operate with limited hours, menus, and capacity and other limitations. Any limitations on or\ndisruptions or closures of merchants’ businesses could impact the selection available on our platform, disrupt our\nability to operate, and adversely affect our business.\nEven if a virus or other disease does not spread significantly and such measures are not implemented, the perceived\nrisk of infection or significant health risk may adversely affect our business. Merchants may be perceived as\nunsafe during such public health threats, even for order delivery or pickup. If the services offered through our\nplatform or at other businesses in our industry become a significant risk for transmitting COVID-19 or similar\npublic health threats, or if there is a public perception that such risk exists, demand for the use of our platform\nwould be adversely affected. Any negative impact on consumers’ willingness or ability to order delivery or complete\na Pickup order, or on Dashers’ willingness or ability to make deliveries, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar public health threat has an impact on our business, it is likely\nto also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “ Risk Factors” section.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors and ultimately may not be successful in attracting\nand retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Price controls on local commerce platforms will have an adverse\nimpact on our results of operations.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, in connection with the COVID-19\npandemic, over fifty (50) jurisdictions across the United States, including many jurisdictions in California, have\nimplemented temporary price controls on local food delivery fulfillment platforms. In addition, there are\nlegislative proposals to make price controls on food delivery fulfillment platforms permanent, and we expect other\nsuch proposals to be made. In addition, some jurisdictions have enacted permanent price controls, including San\nFrancisco, California, New York, New York, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Minneapolis, Minnesota (although the\nlatter two jurisdictions’ price restrictions do not apply when certain conditions are met). We filed litigation\nchallenging the San Francisco and New York price controls as unconstitutional and in excess of each respective\njurisdiction’s police power. There are legislative proposals in additional jurisdictions to make price controls on\nfood delivery fulfillment platforms permanent, and we expect other such proposals to be made in the future. These\nprice controls have had in the past, and are likely to have in the future, an adverse effect on our results of\noperations. These price controls have also caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge\nto consumers, though we are aware of a few jurisdictions that have adopted limits or explicit prohibitions against\ndoing so in connection with price controls. An increase in the fees we charge to consumers could result in reduced\ndemand for our services by consumers. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we\ncategorize or collect such increased consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged\nsuch fees as confusing and/or misleading to consumers. Although temporary price controls in some jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate have expired, with the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect existing price\ncontrols to persist in the near term and additional jurisdictions where we operate may implement similar price\ncontrols. If any of these events occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition,\nregulatory scrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to\nanother, which creates additional challenges to managing our business. Certain of our competitors offer, or may in\nthe future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing\nstrategies that enable them to attract or retain new merchants, consumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will not be forced, through competition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the\nprice of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize our platform, or further\nreduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or to increase our marketing and other\n48\nTable of Contents\nexpenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have\nlaunched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, such as membership products like\nDashPass, and Dasher or consumer loyalty programs, or modify existing pricing methodologies or the way in which\nfees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers or which may result in lower commissions or fees, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, on April 27,\n2021, we changed our merchant pricing models to better support certain U.S. restaurant partners, including by\noffering them a choice of three different delivery commission rates tied to varying levels of marketing support and\nservices. Further, our consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our pricing\nmethodologies may not enable us to compete effectively in these locations. In particular, our continued\ninternational expansion may require us to change our pricing strategies and to adjust to different cultural norms,\nincluding with respect to consumer pricing and gratuities. While we do and will attempt to set prices based on our\nprior operating experience and merchant, consumer, and Dasher feedback and engagement levels, our assessments may\nnot be accurate or there may be errors in the technology used in our pricing and we could be underpricing or\noverpricing our services. In addition, if the services on our platform change, then we may need to revise our\npricing methodologies.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay model for Dashers.\nOur pay model for Dashers, particularly with respect to tips for Dashers, has previously led, and may continue to\nlead, to negative publicity, lawsuits, arbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under our former\nDasher pay model, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little\nor no tip. Although this “boost” pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile,\nit also had the unintended effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being\nreceived by Dashers. Government authorities have also brought claims against us related to our former Dasher pay\nmodel and may bring similar claims in the future. For example, on November 19, 2019, the District of Columbia filed\nan action in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia alleging violations of the District of Columbia’s\nConsumer Protection Procedures Act with respect to our former Dasher pay model and on November 30, 2020, the court\nentered a consent order and judgment to resolve the litigation. We could face similar claims related to our former\nDasher pay model from other government authorities in the future.\nThe incorrect understanding or perception of our former Dasher pay model by some led, and may continue to lead, to\nsome consumers providing lower tips, or no tips at all, to Dashers, which could impact the amount that Dashers are\nable to earn on our platform and our ability to attract and retain Dashers. We have also launched, and may in the\nfuture launch, certain changes to the rates and fee structure for Dashers that utilize our platform, which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers. For example, in September 2019, we changed our Dasher\npay model to include (i) a base pay amount for each order, which depends on the estimated time, distance, and\ndesirability of the order, (ii) promotions for orders that meet certain conditions, including bonuses for Dashers\nwho meet specific goals, and (iii) tips from consumers, which Dashers receive 100% of on top of base pay and\npromotions.\nWe increased the amount we pay to Dashers per order when we changed to our current pay model, but our current\nDasher pay model may also cause less consistency in earnings across deliveries in some cases. Further, this pay\nmodel may lead to negative publicity related to perceptions of the complexity of the pay model, inconsistency in\nearnings for Dashers, and lack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, and as a result, we may not be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers. In the future, based on a variety of\nfactors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may change our pay model again. Our current pay model, and any\nfuture changes to our pay model or our ability to cost-effectively acquire and retain Dashers, could result in an\nincrease to the fees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain\nconsumers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors, there is a risk that\nDashers may be reclassified as employees under federal or state law. As discussed further below, we have been\ninvolved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such\nproceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West,\nInc.v. Superior Court (“Dynamex”), including an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June 2020.\nIn addition, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to\ndetermine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law by\nGovernor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex\nstandard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along\nwith certain other companies, supported a campaign for a 2020 ballot initiative (“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5\nand preserve flexibility for Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in\nDecember 2020. However,\n49\nTable of Contents\non August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court in California issued an order finding that the entirety of\nProposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services\ncoalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 have appealed to the California Court of Appeal. Proposition 22\nremains in effect pending further court proceedings. Under Proposition 22, certain provisions regarding\ncompensation, along with certain other requirements, are now applicable to us and Dashers in California and our\ncosts related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, we do in\ncertain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time and\nadversely impact our results of operations. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate may be considering\nadopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes\nin certain jurisdictions, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits,\nand we are engaged in ongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future\nof the type of work that Dashers perform. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose\nor support legislation, ballot initiatives or other legislative processes in certain jurisdictions, we would expect\nour costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such\njurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, and our results of operations\nwould be adversely impacted. For example, we, along with certain other companies, app-based drivers, and community\ngroups, are supporting a campaign for a 2022 ballot initiative in Massachusetts that would pair worker flexibility\nand independence with new protections and benefits for Dashers in Massachusetts. Even with the passage of\nProposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to\nlitigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior Court challenging the\nconstitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County Superior Court’s order noted above (which\nis being appealed), and similar challenges may also be filed. In addition, we could face further challenges to the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors as other states where we operate are\nconsidering adopting similar legislation or regulations. A reclassification of Dashers or delivery service\nproviders using a local on-demand delivery platform as employees could require us to revise our pricing\nmethodologies and pay model to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other substantive\ninternal adjustments to account for any transition of a Dasher to an employment position, which would have an\nadverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are committed to expanding our platform and enhancing the DoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term\nfinancial results and may yield results that conflict with the market’s expectations, which could result in our\nstock price being adversely affected.\nWe are passionate about expanding our platform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience, with a focus on\ndriving long-term engagement through innovation, the expansion of our platform and services, and providing high-\nquality support, which may not necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business\ndecisions that may reduce our short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our\ngoals to improve the DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term.\nThese decisions may not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the\nlong-term benefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. For example,\nemployee growth has occurred both at our San Francisco headquarters and in a number of our offices across the\nUnited States and internationally. This growth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on\nmanagement and our operational and financial infrastructure. Our failure to implement and maintain effective\ninternal control over financial reporting could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements that\ncould result in a restatement of our financial statements, and could cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations, any of which could diminish investor confidence in us and could cause a decline in the price of our\nClass A common stock. We will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure in order to\nmanage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nA majority of our employees have been with us for fewer than twenty-four (24) months. We have made, and intend to\ncontinue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and sales and marketing\ninfrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees, technologies, and\nacquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our operational and financial\ninfrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large number of new employees,\nwhile maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge our ability to develop\nand improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting systems and procedures,\nrecruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel,\n50\nTable of Contents\nand maintain user satisfaction. Additionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations\neffectively, the quality of our platform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely\naffect our reputation and brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform and will only become more\nimportant as competition in our industry further intensifies. Successfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing\nour reputation and brand and increasing the local network effects of our platform will depend on the success of our\nmarketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high-quality services and support, and our ability to\nsuccessfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use the “DoorDash” mark, our logo, and other trademarks\nimportant to our brand, as well as a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe\nthat our paid marketing initiatives have been critical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives\nnew consumer growth and engagement, but future marketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our\nconsumers have a wide variety of options for delivery of goods, including other local commerce platforms and\nservices, and consumer preferences may also change from time to time. To expand our consumer base, we must appeal\nto new consumers who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or other local commerce\nplatforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with existing and new merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be\nadversely affected by complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform or our competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. Negative\nperception of our platform or company may harm our reputation, brand, and local network effects, including as a\nresult of:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform,\nincluding highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including\nDasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nfraud;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, in which constituencies of our network\nbecome infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient level of orders or to pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nusers’ lack of awareness of, or compliance with, our policies;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission, or not clearly articulated;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of consumer, merchant and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\n51\nTable of Contents\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which we expect would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In\naddition, changes we may make to enhance and improve our platform and balance the needs and interests of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may be viewed positively from one group’s perspective but\nnegatively from another group’s perspective, or may not be viewed positively by any group. If we fail to balance\nthe interests of merchants, consumers, and Dashers or make changes that they view negatively, merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers may stop or reduce usage of our platform or use alternative platforms, any of which could adversely\naffect our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are the subject of media coverage from time to time. Unfavorable publicity regarding our business model, pay\nmodel, user support, technology, platform changes, platform quality, delivery issues, privacy or security\npractices, management team or the safety of Dashers, merchants and consumers using our platform could adversely\naffect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the size of our network and the engagement and\nloyalty of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. For example, we have previously received negative media coverage\nrelated to the manner in which Dashers were compensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related\nto food tampering and general food safety and quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers and\nmerchants using our platform, which has adversely affected our reputation and brand. As our platform continues to\nscale and public awareness of our brand increases, any future issues that draw media coverage could have an\namplified negative effect on our reputation and brand. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands or\ninfluencers that we have partnered with may damage our reputation, even if the publicity is not directly related to\nus. Any negative publicity that we may receive could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which\ncould adversely affect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our\nbrand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, processing, and transmission of personal data and other sensitive\nand proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and proprietary\ndata relating to our business, such as our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our employees. An\nincreasing number of organizations, including large online and off-line merchants and businesses, other large\nInternet companies, financial institutions, and government institutions, have disclosed breaches of their\ninformation security systems and other information security incidents, some of which have involved sophisticated\nand highly targeted attacks. In addition, these incidents could originate on our vendors’ platforms, vendors’\nsystems, or with our vendors’ personnel, which could then be leveraged to access our website, platforms, and\nproprietary data, including personal data. We and our vendors have previously experienced these types of breaches\nand other incidents. For example, in September 2019, we reported an incident affecting one of our vendors that\nresulted in the unauthorized acquisition of certain Dashers’ driver licenses as well as data related to certain of\nour consumers. This incident has resulted in regulatory inquiries and is the subject of litigation. To date, this\nincident has not resulted in a material loss of revenue or the incurrence of material expenses. We have undertaken\nsteps to enhance our data security and governance program, which include adding additional protective security\nlayers around the data, improving security protocols that govern access to our systems, and bringing in outside\nexpertise to increase our ability to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of\nthe incident have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or similar incidents. While we\nmaintain cyber insurance\n52\nTable of Contents\nthat may help provide coverage for these types of incidents, we cannot assure you that our insurance will be\nadequate to cover costs and liabilities related to this incident or to any incidents which may occur in the future.\nIn addition, in December 2021, a vulnerability in a popular logging software, Log4j, was publicly announced. If\nleft unpatched, the Log4j vulnerability could be exploited to allow unauthorized actors to execute code remotely on\na system using Log4j. We have taken steps to ensure these vulnerabilities have been patched in our systems, but we\ncannot guarantee that all vulnerabilities have been patched in every system upon which we are dependent or that\nadditional critical vulnerabilities of Log4j or other open-source software upon which we rely will not be\ndiscovered.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage information systems change frequently and\nmay not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable to anticipate or\nprevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate preventive measures, and we and our vendors\nmay face delays in our detection or remediation of, or other responses to, security breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems or facilities\nused in our business through various means, including gaining unauthorized access into our systems or facilities or\nthose of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, attempting to fraudulently induce our\nemployees, merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card\ninformation, or other sensitive information, which may in turn be used to access our information technology (\"IT\"),\nsystems, or attempting to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants, or others into manipulating payment\ninformation, resulting in the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. Moreover, with many of our employees and\ncontractors and many employees and contractors of vendors currently working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe may be exposed to increased risks of security breaches or incidents. Also, due to political uncertainty and\nmilitary actions associated with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, we and our vendors are vulnerable to heightened\nrisks of cybersecurity incidents and security and privacy breaches from or affiliated with nation-state actors,\nincluding attacks that could materially disrupt our systems, operations, supply chain, website, and platform.\nIn addition, users on our platform could have vulnerabilities on their own devices that are entirely unrelated to\nour systems and platform but could mistakenly attribute their own vulnerabilities to us. Further, breaches\nexperienced by other companies may also be leveraged against us. For example, credential stuffing attacks are\nbecoming increasingly common and sophisticated actors can mask their attacks, making them increasingly difficult to\nidentify and prevent. We have previously experienced incidents of fraud on our platform that we believe involve\ncredential stuffing attacks, which we have been unable to detect or prevent. Certain efforts may be state-sponsored\nor supported by significant financial and technological resources, making them even more difficult to detect,\nremediate, and otherwise respond to.\nAlthough we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect the personal data of merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, protect our systems, prevent data loss, and prevent other\nsecurity breaches and security incidents, these security measures have not fully protected our systems in the past\nand cannot guarantee security in the future. The IT and infrastructure used in our business may be vulnerable to\ncyberattacks, viruses, social engineering, bugs, defects, vulnerabilities, denial of service, credential stuffing,\nransomware and other malware and malicious code, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption or\ninterruption of such IT and infrastructure, or security breaches or incidents, and unauthorized parties may be able\nto access data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers, our employees’ personal data, or our other sensitive and proprietary data, accessible through those\nsystems. Although we have policies restricting the access to the personal data we store, there is a risk that these\npolicies may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach of privacy, or any actual or perceived\nsecurity breach or other incidents, could interrupt our operations, result in our platform being unavailable,\nresult in loss or improper access to, unavailability of, acquisition, disclosure, modification or other processing\nof, data, result in fraudulent transfer of funds, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, damage our\nrelationships with third-party partners, or result in claims, regulatory investigations, and proceedings and\nsignificant legal, regulatory, and financial exposure, including ongoing monitoring by regulators, and any such\nincidents or any perception that our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or\nDasher confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nAny actual or perceived breach of privacy or security, or other security incident, impacting any entities with\nwhich we share or disclose data (including, for example, our third-party technology providers and vendors) could\nhave similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security measures is limited. There have been and may\ncontinue to be significant supply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not\nbeen breached or that they do not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an\nincident, breach, or other disruption to, our or our vendors’ systems.\n53\nTable of Contents\nAlso, applicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property, such as our trade\nsecrets and other proprietary data. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law effective in December\n2021 that would require us to provide customer data, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses and delivery\naddresses, to restaurant merchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a customer opts out.\nFurthermore, this could result in certain consumers receiving unsolicited outreach from merchants as a result of\nthis data sharing, which could lead to a negative consumer experience. We have filed a lawsuit challenging this\nlaw, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against us during the pendency of the litigation. If our\nlawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an adverse effect on our intellectual property or\nresult in harm to our reputation or brand. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived security or privacy\nbreaches or other incidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as\na whole and, as a result, reduce confidence in us. We also expect to incur significant costs in an effort to detect\nand prevent privacy and security breaches and other incidents, and we may face increased costs and expend\nsubstantial resources in the event of an actual or perceived privacy or security breach or other incident.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any privacy or security breach or incident,\nregardless of their merit, could be costly and divert management’s attention. We cannot be certain that our\ninsurance coverage will be adequate for liabilities incurred relating to any privacy or security breach or\nincident, that insurance will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that\nany insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims\nagainst us that exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have an\nadverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe markets for on-demand local commerce and our other delivery fulfillment services are still in relatively early\nstages of growth, and if these markets do not continue to grow, grow slower than we expect, or fail to grow as\nlarge as we expect, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe local on-demand delivery market has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is still\nrelatively new, and it is uncertain to what extent market acceptance will continue to grow, if at all. In addition,\nthe market for the other delivery fulfillment services we facilitate, is also relatively nascent, and it is\nuncertain whether demand for grocery delivery services or other services we may facilitate in the future will\ncontinue to grow and achieve wide market acceptance, if at all. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on\nthe willingness of people to widely adopt on-demand local commerce and the other delivery fulfillment services we\nfacilitate. If the public does not perceive these services as beneficial, or chooses not to adopt them as a result\nof concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other reasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform\nor on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead adopts alternative solutions that may arise, then the\nmarket for our platform may not further develop, may develop slower than we expect, or may not achieve the growth\npotential we expect, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are intentionally impersonating consumers or Dashers or the\nactivities of Dashers while making deliveries to our consumers, have occurred, and in the future may occur, which\ncould adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities\ninclude food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, assault, battery,\ntheft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts, sharing of consumer accounts, registering\nDasher accounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and other misconduct. Such\nactivities may result in injuries, property damage, or loss of life for consumers and third parties, or business\ninterruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other significant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card data, referral fraud by both consumers and Dashers, fraud with respect to\nbackground checks, fraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, attempted payments\nby consumers with insufficient funds, fraud committed by consumers in concert with Dashers, and account takeovers\nof Dasher accounts by bad actors. Bad actors use increasingly sophisticated methods to engage in illegal activities\ninvolving personal information, such as unauthorized use of another person’s identity, account information, or\npayment information and unauthorized acquisition or use of credit or debit card details, bank account information,\nand mobile phone numbers. For\n54\nTable of Contents\nexample, bad actors have created Dasher accounts using other people’s stolen personal identifying information to\ncommit fraud on our platform and for other illicit purposes. Among other things, this has caused Form 1099s to be\nincorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as Dashers. We have launched a series of\ninitiatives and products changes to help prevent these practices.\nUnder current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit\ncard data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card transaction. Despite measures we\nhave taken to detect and reduce the occurrence of fraudulent or other malicious activity on our platform, we cannot\nguarantee that any of our measures will be effective or will scale efficiently with our business. Our failure to\nadequately detect or prevent fraudulent transactions could harm our reputation or brand, result in litigation or\nregulatory action, and lead to expenses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nactivities, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivity by these parties from occurring and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through\nlitigation, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. For example, Dashers whose accounts we have deactivated\nfrom our platform may nevertheless find a way to create a new account on our platform and perform deliveries. At\nthe same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate\nactivities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check, are too restrictive and\ninadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good standing from using our platform, or if we are unable\nto implement and communicate these measures fairly and transparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, the\ngrowth and engagement of the number of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be\nadversely affected. In addition, our ability to adopt measures to anticipate, identify, and address illegal,\nimproper, or otherwise inappropriate activity may be particularly limited with our Self-Delivery service, which\nenables merchants on our Marketplace to fulfill orders with their own delivery fleets. These delivery providers are\nretained directly by merchants, and as a result, we do not conduct background checks on such providers or engage in\nany of the other activities that are a part of the typical onboarding process for Dashers on our platform. Further,\nany negative publicity related to the foregoing, whether such incident occurred on our platform or on our\ncompetitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a\nwhole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory\nor litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which includes facilitating deliveries to consumers\nfrom non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less operationally\nefficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner merchants’\nsystems. For example, for orders with most partner merchants, Dashers have an expedited checkout process that does\nnot require a separate payment in store, but for orders with non-partner merchants, Dashers may have to place and\npay for the order separately in store. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each\norder, more time and manual processes needed to place each order, and a higher likelihood of errors. Further, we\nsometimes unintentionally incorrectly price non-partner goods on our platform as a result of inaccuracies that\noccur when capturing menu prices. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated\nwith facilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and\ncause damage to our reputation and brand. While our goal is to convert non-partner merchants into partner\nmerchants, our inability to do so at a sufficiently high rate, or at all, could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, some non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed.\nWhile we honor these requests, removing non-partner merchants impacts our ability to provide a broad selection of\nmerchants. In addition, there is a risk that non-partner merchants bring legal claims against us relating to their\ninclusion on our platform. For example, in 2015, In-N-Out Burger filed a complaint against us claiming unfair\ncompetition, among other claims, and sought a permanent injunction to stop us from delivering their food. There is\nalso a risk that state or local law is enacted to prevent platforms like ours from including non-partners on the\nplatform. For example, the California Legislature passed legislation, California Assembly Bill 2149 (“AB 2149”),\nwhich was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom and became effective on January 1, 2021. AB 2149 prohibits,\namong other things, delivery fulfillment platforms from facilitating deliveries from restaurants in California\nwithout the restaurants’ prior consent. Similar prohibitions have also been enacted in jurisdictions where we\noperate including Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Arkansas, Virginia, Washington, DC, Nevada, Missouri, Oregon,\nRhode Island, New York, Colorado, and New Hampshire and are being contemplated in other jurisdictions. Beyond\nregulatory restrictions, we may also adopt internal policies that limit or prohibit the facilitation of deliveries\nfrom merchants without their prior consent. For example, in November 2020, we adopted\n55\nTable of Contents\ninternal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our\nplatform in the United States and such policies require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner\nrestaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with\nDoorDash. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal and regulatory changes, we may continue to\nrevise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the extent we\nare required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this will adversely affect our ability to\nattract and retain consumers and could directly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsite and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. If we fail\nto expand the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform, or if we fail to continuously enhance\nand improve our existing merchant services, our ability to retain and acquire merchants could be adversely\naffected. If competitors introduce new offerings embodying new technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices emerge, our existing technology, services, website, and mobile applications may become obsolete. Our\nfuture success could depend on our ability to respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and\npractices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to our platform and new services on our platform may involve significant technical risks and\nupfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new technologies ineffectively,\nor we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in introducing new or enhanced\nplatform features and services or if our recently introduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our\nexpectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform may forego the use of our services in\nfavor of those of our competitors.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business and to attract new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers,\nand Dashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and generating a meaningful return on these initiatives may\nbe difficult. Even if we successfully increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset\nthe additional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective,\nwe expect that our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nnot only qualified to support users of our platform but are also well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of international\nusers on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with\ndelivering support in languages other than English. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market\nperception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our ability\nto scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\n56\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the resulting gains in\nefficiency to our platform that we expect, or at all. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business\nand subject to a number of risks, including changes to our Dasher pay model. The cost effectiveness of our platform\nwould also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do not reduce the number of\ndefective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are unable to maintain or\nimprove the cost effectiveness of our platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency and Dasher pay, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending and Dasher behavior patterns that have an impact on our\ngrowth and expenses. We may experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the calendar year, although\nour rapid growth and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has made, and may continue to make, seasonal fluctuations\ndifficult to detect. For example, consumer activity can be impacted by colder or more inclement weather, which may\nincrease consumer demand, and warmer or sunny weather, which may decrease consumer demand. In addition, the number\nof available Dashers may decrease during periods of inclement weather, but consumer demand during these times may\nrequire us to have more Dashers available to fulfill orders. During these times, we typically rely on incentive pay\nto attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs. Further, severe\nweather in certain areas can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, and make it impossible for Dashers\nto make deliveries if roads are closed or difficult to drive on. In addition, we benefit from increased order\nvolume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we experience a decrease in order volume when school is\nnot in session and during summer breaks and other vacation periods, causing a similar decrease in Dasher pay.\nSeasonality will likely cause fluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other\nseasonal trends may develop and the existing seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and\ncontribute to fluctuations in our results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we\nmay not accurately forecast our results of operations. However, we base our spending and investment plans on\nforecasts and estimates, and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than\nexpected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\n57\nTable of Contents\nThe impact of economic conditions, including the resulting effects on consumer spending and merchant performance,\nmay adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur performance is subject to economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the\nfactors having an impact on discretionary consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment,\nconsumer debt, reductions in net worth, inflation, changes to gasoline and vehicle costs, residential real estate\nand mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence, and other macroeconomic\nfactors. Consumer purchases of discretionary items may decline during recessionary periods and other periods in\nwhich disposable income is adversely affected. Economic conditions in certain regions may also be affected by\nnatural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats to public health, such as the COVID-19\npandemic. Further, small businesses that do not have substantial resources, like some of the merchants on our\nplatform, tend to be more adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our\nplatform cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, we\nmay not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely to use our\nplatform. This risk is particularly pronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of\nrestaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have fewer merchants. In addition, because spending for\npurchases from many of the merchants on our platform is generally considered to be discretionary, we expect that\nany decline in consumer spending would have a disproportionate effect on our business relative to those businesses\nthat sell products or services considered to be necessities. If spending at the merchants on our platform declines,\nconsumers may be less likely to use our platform, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations. Additionally, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain\nissues, labor shortages, inflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages at merchants could negatively\nimpact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplace and in our Drive\nbusiness. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact consumer demand\nand drive lower order volume on our Marketplace and in our Drive business.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new local markets in which we have limited or no prior\noperating experience.\nOur capacity for continued growth depends in part on our ability to expand our operations into, and compete\neffectively in, new local markets. It may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict consumer\npreferences and purchasing habits in these new local markets. In addition, each market has unique regulatory\ndynamics. These include laws and regulations that can directly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the\npool of Dashers that are available, and our costs associated with insurance, support, fraud, and onboarding new\nDashers. In addition, each market is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These include our\nability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently attract and\nretain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key business\nmetrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing dynamics in\nthe local markets where we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations and are\nunable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur presence outside the United States and any future international expansion strategy will subject us to\nadditional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\nWe have started expanding our presence internationally. For example, we launched our platform in Canada in 2015, in\nAustralia in 2019, in Japan and Germany in 2021, and we expect to expand our international operations, particularly\nthrough the proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\"). Operating outside of the United States may require\nsignificant management attention to oversee operations over a broad geographic area with varying cultural norms and\ncustoms, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations\nteams. We may incur significant operating expenses and may not be successful in our international expansion for a\nvariety of reasons, including:\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintaining our company culture\nacross all of our offices;\nan inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\n58\nTable of Contents\ncomplying with varying laws and regulatory standards, including with respect to labor and employment, data\nprivacy, data protection, tax, and local regulatory restrictions;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\ncurrency exchange restrictions or costs and exchange rate fluctuations;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or\nviruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility and\ngeopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with\nrespect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions.\n59\nTable of Contents\nIf we or our partners fail to develop and successfully commercialize autonomous or drone delivery technologies or\nfail to develop such technologies before our competitors, or if such technologies fail to perform as expected,\nchange our cost structure materially, are inferior to those of our competitors, or are perceived as less safe than\nthose of our competitors or non-autonomous or non-drone delivery methods, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that autonomous and drone delivery technologies may have the ability to meaningfully impact our\nindustry. We have invested and we expect to continue to invest in research and development related to autonomous\nand drone delivery technologies, either directly or in partnership with companies that develop such technologies.\nWhile we believe that autonomous and drone delivery could present substantial opportunities, the development of\nsuch technologies is expensive and time-consuming and may not be successful. Autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies involve significant risks and liabilities. Failures of our or our partners’ autonomous or drone\ndelivery technologies could generate substantial liability, create negative publicity, or result in regulatory\nscrutiny, all of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, results of operations, and\nprospects. Even if our or our partners’ efforts to develop autonomous and drone delivery technologies are\nsuccessful, such efforts may not be cost-effective and there is no guarantee that such technologies can reduce our\ncurrent costs of facilitating on-demand delivery services. Further, several other companies, including Uber and\nAmazon, are also developing autonomous and drone delivery technologies, either themselves or through\ncollaborations, and we expect that they will use such technology to further compete with us in the local delivery\nfulfillment industry. Certain competitors may commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies at scale\nbefore we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone delivery to market before\nwe do, or their technology is or is perceived to be superior to our or our partners’ technology, they may be able\nto leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. For example, if competitors develop autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies that successfully reduce the cost of facilitating delivery fulfillment services, these competitors\ncould offer their services at lower prices as compared to the price available to consumers on our platform. If a\nsignificant number of consumers choose to use our competitors’ offerings over ours, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurther, we expect that governments will develop regulations that are specifically designed to apply to autonomous\nand drone technologies. These regulations could include requirements that significantly delay or narrowly limit the\ncommercialization of autonomous and drone technologies, limit the amount of autonomous and drone delivery on our\nplatform, or impose significant liabilities on manufacturers or operators of these solutions or developers of these\ntechnologies. Moreover, these regulations may affect our or our partners’ ability to design and manufacture new\nautonomous or drone technologies. For example, commercial drone regulations adopted by the Federal Aviation\nAdministration limit the altitude, available airspace, and weight of a drone and also the certification of remote\npilots that can operate a drone for commercial purposes in the United States. If regulations of this nature\ncontinue to be implemented, we or our partners may not be able to commercialize autonomous and drone delivery\ntechnologies in the manner we expect, or at all. Further, if we or our partners are unable to comply with existing\nor new regulations or laws applicable to autonomous and drone solutions, we could become subject to substantial\nfines or penalties.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate them into our business, our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of potential strategic transactions,\nincluding acquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments that\ncomplement our business. For example, in November 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Wolt, a\nlocal commerce platform based in Finland, which is expected to close in the first half of 2022, and on March 1,\n2022 we completed an acquisition of Bbot, Inc. We have previously acquired and continue to evaluate targets that\noperate in relatively nascent markets, and as a result, there is no assurance that such acquired businesses will be\nsuccessfully integrated into our business or generate substantial revenue.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial\ncondition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and adversely affect our\nability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\nfailure or material delay in closing a transaction;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts, and personnel of an acquired\ncompany;\n60\nTable of Contents\ndifficulties in retaining key employees or business partners of an acquired company;\ndifficulties in retaining merchants, consumers, and delivery service providers, as applicable, of an acquired\ncompany;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition\nopportunities;\nthe need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public\ncompany like ours at companies we may acquire that prior to acquisition may not have robust controls, procedures,\nand policies, in particular, with respect to the effectiveness of internal controls, cyber and information security\npractices, incident response plans, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans, compliance with privacy,\ndata protection, information security, and other regulations, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and\nsanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or\ntechnology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, revenue\nrecognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nrisks that regulatory bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to an acquired\ncompany or business;\nrisks that regulatory bodies do not approve our acquisitions or business combinations or delay such approvals;\ntheft of our trade secrets or confidential information that we share with potential acquisition candidates;\nrisk that an acquired company or investment in new services cannibalizes a portion of our existing business; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, in\nOctober 2021, we closed a $395 million investment in preferred shares of a private company based in Europe which\nprovides an instant grocery delivery service. Strategic investments inherently involve a lesser degree of control\nover business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or\ncompliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on\npartners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have\nbusiness interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or\nother actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who\ncontrol them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against\nus, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our\ninvestments may be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with\nforeign entities now or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign\ndirect investment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity was subject to\nregulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and\nthus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy. In addition, our investments are speculative in\nnature and may decline in value or be entirely lost, and we may not have liquidity opportunities for our\ninvestments in private companies.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of businesses, new technologies, services, and other assets and strategic investments, or if we fail\nto successfully integrate such acquisitions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our\n61\nTable of Contents\nmanagement team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find suitable replacements on a timely\nbasis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary employees,\nparticularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In addition, from time to\ntime, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received significant proceeds from sales of our equity in private transactions and many of our\nemployees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity in the public\nmarkets, which may reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of\ncash and equity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit,\ntrain, and integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us;\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management; and\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet. We\nmay operate in jurisdictions that provide limited Internet connectivity, particularly as we expand internationally.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\n62\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal,\naccounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and\nplace significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports\nregarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other\ninformation, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In\naddition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New\nYork Stock Exchange.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\noverwhelming number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not\nreturn to our platform as often in the future, or at all. This would adversely affect our ability to attract\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that\nwe do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our\ntechnology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business,\nreputation, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n63\nTable of Contents\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely impact our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity, a loss of users or loss of revenue, and\naccess or other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by malicious actors and result in\nexposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach or other security incident. We\nmay need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around\nerrors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any\nsuch errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting and/or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will\nresult in dilution to our stockholders. We also permit certain RSU holders to elect to cover the RSU tax\nwithholding liabilities by providing to us a cash payment amount.\nTo fund the tax withholding and remittance obligations arising in connection with the future vesting and/or\nsettlement of RSUs, we will either (i) withhold shares of our Class A common stock that would otherwise be issued\nwith respect to such RSUs and pay the relevant tax authorities in cash (which may include cash generated from the\nproceeds of the IPO) to satisfy such tax obligations, (ii) have the holders of such RSUs use a broker or brokers to\nsell a portion of such shares into the market on the applicable settlement date, with the proceeds of such sales to\nbe delivered to us for remittance to the relevant taxing authorities, in order to satisfy such tax withholding and\nremittance obligations, or (iii) allow certain holders of such RSUs to pay us an amount in cash, via a broker,\nsufficient to cover the applicable RSU tax withholding obligations. The tax withholding due in connection with such\nRSU vesting and settlement will be based on the then-current value of the underlying shares of our Class A common\nstock, and we would expect to withhold and remit the tax withholding liabilities at the applicable statutory rates\non behalf of the RSU holders to the relevant tax authorities in cash. If we withhold shares of our Class A common\nstock that would otherwise be issued with respect to the vesting and/or settlement of RSUs and pay the relevant tax\nauthorities in cash to satisfy such tax obligations, this may result in significant cash expenditures by us. We\nhave implemented “sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations, pursuant to which shares with a market\nvalue equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and\nsettlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the\ntaxing authorities. Such sales or any cash amount that the holder provides to us to cover the applicable RSU tax\nwithholding obligations, in either case, will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the\ntax withholding obligations for RSUs, but will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number\nof shares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\n64\nTable of Contents\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts and key business and non-\nGAAP metrics such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Adjusted EBITDA Margin, with internal systems and tools\nthat are not independently verified by any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics\npublished by third parties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our\ninternal systems and tools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may\nchange over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly\ndisclose. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or\ncontain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are\nbased on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there\nare inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy\nof our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there\nare consumers who have multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our Terms of Service and we implement\nmeasures to detect and prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the\nnumber of consumers on our platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with\nrespect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could\naffect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if\ninvestors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with\nrespect to these figures, we expect that our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations\nwould be adversely affected.\nOperating as a public company requires us to incur substantial costs and requires substantial management attention.\nIn addition, key members of our management team have limited experience managing a public company.\nAs a public company, we incur substantial legal, accounting, and other expenses that we did not incur as a private\ncompany. For example, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the applicable requirements\nof the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the rules and regulations\nof the SEC, and the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. For example, the Exchange Act requires, among\nother things, we file annual, quarterly, and current reports with respect to our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. We are also required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. Compliance with these rules and regulations has increased and will continue to\nincrease our legal and financial compliance costs, and increase demand on our systems. In addition, as a public\ncompany, we may be subject to stockholder activism, which can lead to additional substantial costs, distract\nmanagement, and impact the manner in which we operate our business in ways we cannot currently anticipate. As a\nresult of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company, our business and financial condition\nwill become more visible, which may result in threatened or actual litigation, including by competitors.\nMany members of our management team have limited experience managing a publicly traded company, interacting with\npublic company investors, and complying with the increasingly complex laws pertaining to public companies. Our\nmanagement team may not successfully or efficiently manage our transition to being a public company subject to\nsignificant regulatory oversight and reporting obligations under the federal securities laws and the continuous\nscrutiny of securities analysts and investors. These new obligations and constituencies will require significant\nattention from our senior management and could divert their attention away from the day-to-day management of our\nbusiness, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions\nand insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive\nmodeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective and speculative. Additionally, actuarial\nprojections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently\nrepresented in the historical data or which are not yet quantifiable. While an independent actuary firm\nperiodically reviews our reserves for appropriateness, a number of\n65\nTable of Contents\nexternal factors can affect the actual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length\nof time the claim remains open, fluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial\ndevelopments and unexpected events such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such\nfactors can impact the reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to\nestimate the reserves for claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and\nhistorical periods. For any of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may\ndeviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our consolidated financial\nstatements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase\nsuch reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in\nwhich the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers are reclassified as employees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification\nof Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an\nindependent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact sensitive. Laws and\nregulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to changes and\ndivergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us. We\nmaintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are independent contractors. However, Dashers may be reclassified\nas employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on service provider classification and\ntheir potential impact on the local commerce industry. A reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service\nproviders as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations,\nincluding as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to failure to, withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to the California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers or other delivery service providers as\nemployees would require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability\nto add and retain Dashers to our platform and grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in\nDynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for\nexample, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. This action is seeking both\nrestitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify Dashers as\nindependent contractors. The San Francisco District Attorney also sought a preliminary injunction that would have\nbarred us from continuing to classify Dashers in California as independent contractors during the pendency of this\ncase. The request for the preliminary injunction was withdrawn in December 2020. We believe we have meritorious\ndefenses, despite the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In\naddition, in 2017, we settled one classification matter in California on a class basis\n66\nTable of Contents\nincluding claims raised under PAGA and in 2022 we settled a similar classification matter covering Massachusetts\nand California Dashers including claims raised under PAGA.\nSome jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to the test set forth in Dynamex to determine\nworker classification. Further, the California Legislature passed AB 5 and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin\nNewsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding\ncontractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other\ncompanies, supported a campaign for the 2020 California ballot initiative Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and\npreserve flexibility for Dashers, which passed in November 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County\nSuperior Court in California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The\nCalifornia Attorney General and other groups and individuals have filed appealed to the California Court of Appeal.\nAs a result, to the extent Proposition 22 remains in effect pending further court proceedings, as such, certain\nprovisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in\nCalifornia and our costs related to Dashers have increased in California. To offset a portion of these increased\ncosts, we do in certain circumstances charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes\nover time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs\ncould also lead to a lower Net Revenue Margin, which we previously referred to in past SEC filings as Take Rate,\ndefined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that\nare now applicable to us include, but are not limited to, (i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain\nother amounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings floor equal to (A) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s\nengaged time and (B) for Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for\ninflation after 2021) and (ii) for Dashers averaging at least fifteen (15) hours per week of engaged time during a\ncalendar quarter who subscribe to a qualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of\nvarying dollar amounts depending on a Dasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 is likely to have an\nadverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate may be considering\nadopting legislation that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we\nare engaged in ongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers and other stakeholders regarding the future of the\ntype of work that Dashers perform. To the extent other states adopt such legislation, we would expect our costs\nrelated to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such\njurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our\nresults of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and\nlegislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in\nCalifornia Superior Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County\nSuperior Court’s order noted above (which is being appealed), and similar challenges may also be filed.\nFurthermore, if Dashers are determined to be employees in other states or under federal law, this could result in\neven higher increases to our costs related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and commissions\neven more and may result in further lower order volumes. To the extent Dashers are determined to be employees under\nother state or federal law, we would be required to significantly alter our existing business model and operations,\nwhich would have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, investigations, and various proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses\nfor legal claims, and harm to our business based on the nature of our business.\nWe face potential liability, expenses for legal claims, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our\nbusiness generally, and with the food delivery services we facilitate in particular, including potential claims\nrelated to food offerings, delivery, and quality.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, and other legal,\nregulatory, and other administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage,\nworker classification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer\ncomplaints, intellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to consumers and Dashers, compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and other matters, and we may become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits,\ngovernment investigations, and legal or regulatory proceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by Dashers that utilize our platform. We have incurred expenses to settle personal injury claims, which we\nsometimes choose to settle for reasons including expediency, protection of our reputation, and to prevent the\nuncertainty of litigating, and we expect that such expenses will continue to increase as our business grows and we\nface increasing public scrutiny. In addition, we could be subject to legal claims relating to the sale of alcoholic\nbeverages or alcohol consumption. Regardless of the\n67\nTable of Contents\noutcome of any legal proceeding, any injuries to, or deaths of, any consumers, Dashers, or third parties could\nresult in negative publicity and harm to our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses (such as E. Coli, avian flu, bovine spongiform\nencephalopathy, hepatitis A, trichinosis, or salmonella) and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to potential legal\nclaims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could do so in the\nfuture as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that\ngenerate a significant percentage of our overall Marketplace GOV, it could seriously harm our business. The\npotential for acts of terrorism on the United States or international food supply also exists and, if such an event\noccurs, it could harm our business and results of operations. Further, food that is ordered through our platform\ncould be subject to a recall, but we may have limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a food recall. In\naddition, reports of food-borne illnesses, food recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food\npreparation, handling, or delivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, could,\nas a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales tax,\nservice fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including the background\ncheck process, and the nature and frequency of our communications to Dashers via email, text, or telephone. In\naddition, we also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class actions, by consumers relating\nto, among other things, our Dasher pay model, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to sales\ntax, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the local food delivery fulfillment services we facilitate,\ndiscrepancies between the menus on our website and consumer mobile application and the menus at the restaurant from\nwhich the food is delivered, including discrepancies in menu items and the prices of such items and taxes on such\nitems, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or telephone.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our\nwebsite and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and\nnegligence, among others. We also face potential liability and expense for claims arising from a data security\nincident, including claims regarding the adequacy and timeliness of our response to such an incident and our\nnotification to affected consumers and Dashers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, or other legal or\nregulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us, whether meritorious\nor not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation, require significant\nmanagement attention, and divert significant resources. Determining reserves for our pending litigation is a\ncomplex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation. It is possible\nthat a resolution of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and\npenalties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. These\nproceedings could also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or\nother orders requiring a change in our business practices. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual\nand other legal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial\npartners and current and former directors and officers.\nIn addition, we include arbitration and class action waiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. These provisions are intended to streamline the litigation\nprocess for all parties involved, as they can in some cases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in\nstate or federal court. However, arbitration can be costly and burdensome, and the use of arbitration and class\naction waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our reputation and brand, as these provisions have been\nthe subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize these risks to our reputation and brand, we may\nlimit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or be required to do so in a legal or regulatory\nproceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure. Additionally, we permit\ncertain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which could also cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between state and federal law, there is a risk that some or\nall of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be revised\nto exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or in\npart, or specific claims are required to be\n68\nTable of Contents\nexempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate disputes and the time involved in resolving such\ndisputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or inaccuracies could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain because it is not clear how new and existing statutes might apply to our\nbusiness or to local commerce platforms generally.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which has resulted in discussions\nabout tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenue, including through indirect taxes. Such taxes\ncould adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, and goods and services taxes in the\nUnited States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate, such as Canada and Australia, and we may face various\nindirect tax audits in various U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and remit\nindirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our calculation,\nreporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently\ndo so or to remit additional taxes and interest, and could impose associated penalties and fees. A successful\nassertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do not\ncurrently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which we currently collect taxes, could result\nin substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and interest, could discourage\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and remitting them to the\nappropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such taxes. Additionally,\nif merchants try to pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to consumers, order volume may decline.\nAlthough we have reserved for potential payments of possible past tax liabilities in our consolidated financial\nstatements, if these liabilities exceed such reserves, our financial condition would be harmed.\nUnder state tax law, we may be deemed responsible for collecting and remitting sales taxes directly to certain\nstates. Our responsibility for these taxes may be applicable to past sales and could be applicable to the cost of\ngoods or fees charged on our platform. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales, use,\nor other taxes or remitting such taxes directly to states could result in substantial tax liabilities for past\nsales and additional administrative expenses. These taxes could also increase the cost for consumers using our\nplatform. Any of the foregoing would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, one or more states, localities, or other taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose additional\nreporting, record-keeping, or indirect tax collection obligations on businesses like ours. For example, taxing\nauthorities in the United States and other countries have identified e-commerce platforms as a means to calculate,\ncollect, and remit indirect taxes for transactions taking place over the Internet, and are considering related\nlegislation. After the U.S. Supreme Court decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., certain states have enacted\nlaws that would require tax reporting, collection, or tax remittance on items sold online. Requiring tax reporting\nor collection could decrease merchant, consumer, or Dasher activity, which would harm our business. This new\nlegislation could require us or Dashers to incur substantial costs in order to comply, including costs associated\nwith tax calculation, collection, and remittance and audit requirements, which could make our offerings less\nattractive and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAlso, the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in financial liability and other consequences to us if we were unable to remedy\nsuch failures in a timely manner.\n69\nTable of Contents\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our consolidated financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of\noperations in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax\noutcome is determined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could\nbe adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates,\ncertain non-deductible expenses, and the valuation of deferred tax assets. Increases in our effective tax rate\nwould reduce profitability or increase losses.\nAs we expand the scale of our international business activities, any changes in the United States or foreign\ntaxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nFurther, income earned by us and our subsidiaries may be subject to taxation in more than one jurisdiction, such as\nthe jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of us or the applicable subsidiary as well as the jurisdiction\nfrom which such income is derived. This may result in double taxation if relief is not available under applicable\ndomestic or non-U.S. law or an applicable tax treaty. Any double taxation may impact the financial results of our\noperations.\nWe have been subject to examination, and may be subject to examination in the future, by federal, state, local, and\nforeign tax authorities on income, employment, sales, and other tax matters. While we regularly assess the\nlikelihood of adverse outcomes from such examinations and the adequacy of our provision for taxes, there can be no\nassurance that such provision is sufficient and that a determination by a tax authority would not have an adverse\neffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Certain risks relating to employment taxes\nand sales taxes are described in more detail under “ — If Dashers in the United States are reclassified as\nemployees under federal or state law, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected .” and “ — Taxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or\nremitted, or in the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, or similar taxes or\nwithholding taxes, and may successfully impose additional obligations on us, and any such assessments, obligations,\nor inaccuracies could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. ”\nIn addition, regulatory or legislative developments may also arise from the proposed U.S. tax reform under the\nBiden Administration, which has proposed several changes to the corporate income tax regime, which, if adopted,\ncould result in increased taxation of our domestic and international business operations. There is uncertainty\nregarding what changes, if any, will be enacted and the effect on our business and financial results.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had accumulated $4.1 billion and $3.3 billion of federal and state net operating loss\ncarryforwards (\"NOLs\"), respectively, available to reduce future taxable income, some of which will begin to expire\nin 2036 for federal and 2024 for state tax purposes. It is possible that we will not generate taxable income in\ntime to use NOLs before their expiration, or at all. Under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” the corporation’s ability to\nuse its pre-change NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D tax credits, to offset its post-change income may\nbe limited. In general, an “ownership change” will occur if there is a cumulative change in our ownership by “5\npercent stockholders” that exceeds fifty (50) percentage points over a rolling three-year period. Similar rules may\napply under state tax laws. Our ability to use NOLs and other tax attributes, including R&D credit carryforwards,\nto reduce future taxable income and liabilities may be subject to annual limitations as a result of prior ownership\nchanges and ownership changes that may occur in the future. Prior to the utilization of NOLs in the future, we will\ndetermine whether there are any limitations under Section 382 of the Code.\nThere is also a risk that due to changes in applicable law or regulatory changes (such as suspensions on the use of\nNOLs and other tax attributes by certain jurisdictions, including in order to raise additional revenue to help\ncounter the fiscal impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, possibly with retroactive effect) or other unforeseen\nreasons, our existing NOLs and other tax attributes could expire or otherwise be unavailable to offset future\nincome tax liabilities. For these reasons, we may not be able to realize a tax benefit from the use of our NOLs and\nother tax attributes.\n70\nTable of Contents\nOur business is subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, and pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing,\nand failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay, insurance, and pricing and commissions. Laws, regulations, and standards\ngoverning issues such as worker classification or our relationship with Dashers on our platform more generally (for\nexample, those concerning Dasher pay, insurance requirements, and other aspects of our relationship with Dashers),\nlabor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products,\nonline credit card payments, gratuities, pricing and commissions, text messaging, membership services, intellectual\nproperty, data retention, privacy, data security, consumer protection, background checks, website and mobile\napplication accessibility, and tax are often complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in\nmany cases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are\napplicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations\nbetween state and federal law, between individual states, and even at the city and municipality level. As a result,\ntheir application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or\ninterpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, state, and local administrative\nagencies. We have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that\nour platform is available broadly in the United States and foreign jurisdictions including Canada and Australia.\nAdditionally, laws relating to the potential liability of providers of online services for activities of their\nusers and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims, including actions based on invasion\nof privacy and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, and other theories based on\nthe nature and content of the materials searched, the ads posted, or the content provided by users. In addition,\nregulatory authorities in the United States at the federal and state level are considering a number of legislative\nand regulatory proposals concerning privacy and other matters that may be applicable to our business. It is also\nlikely that as our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, as with\nour November 2021 launch in Germany, we would become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions.\nIt is difficult to predict how existing laws would be applied to our business and the new laws to which it may\nbecome subject.\nRecent financial, political, and other events may increase the level of regulatory scrutiny on larger companies,\ntechnology companies in general, and companies engaged in dealings with independent contractors. Regulatory and\nadministrative bodies may enact new laws or promulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they\nmay view matters or interpret laws and regulations differently than they have in the past or in a manner adverse to\nour business, including by changing employment-related laws or by regulating or capping the commissions businesses\nlike ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in connection with the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, over fifty (50) jurisdictions across the United States, including many jurisdictions in\nCalifornia, have implemented temporary price controls on local commerce platforms. In addition, some jurisdictions\nhave enacted permanent price controls, including San Francisco, California, New York, New York, Philadelphia,\nPennsylvania, and Minneapolis, Minnesota (although the latter two jurisdictions’ price restrictions do not apply\nwhen certain conditions are met). We filed litigation challenging the San Francisco and New York price controls as\nunconstitutional and in excess of each respective jurisdiction’s police power. There are legislative proposals in\nadditional jurisdictions to make price controls on local commerce platforms permanent, and we expect other such\nproposals to be made in the future. These price controls have had in the past, and are likely to have in the\nfuture, an adverse effect on our results of operations. These price controls have also caused, and may in the\nfuture cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers, though we are aware of multiple jurisdictions which\nhave adopted explicit limits or prohibitions against doing so in connection with price controls, which could\nfurther increase our costs. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge the way in which we categorize or\ncollect such increased consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as\nconfusing and/or misleading to consumers. Although temporary price controls in some jurisdictions in which we\noperate have expired, with the continued duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect existing price controls to\npersist in the near term and for additional jurisdictions where we operate to implement similar price controls. If\nany of these events occur, or if price controls are retained after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be further adversely affected. In addition, regulatory\nscrutiny or action may create different or conflicting obligations on us from one jurisdiction to another, which\ncreates additional challenges to managing our business.\nOur success, or perceived success, and increased visibility may also drive some businesses that perceive our\nbusiness model negatively to raise their concerns to local policymakers and regulators. These businesses and their\ntrade association groups or other organizations may take actions and employ significant resources to shape the\nlegal and\n71\nTable of Contents\nregulatory regimes in jurisdictions where we may have, or seek to have, a market presence in an effort to change\nsuch legal and regulatory regimes in ways intended to adversely affect or impede our business and the ability of\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers to use our platform. If we are not able to comply with these laws or regulations\nor if we become liable under these laws or regulations, including any future laws or obligations that we may not be\nable to anticipate at this time, we could be adversely affected, and we may be forced to implement new measures to\nreduce our exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue\ncertain services or platform features, which would adversely affect our business. Any failure to comply with\napplicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and regulatory proceedings, fines,\nor other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, and other enforcement\nactions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative\nproposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred\nto prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws\nand regulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other\nanticorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad. These laws generally prohibit us and our employees from improperly influencing government\nofficials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain business, direct business to any person, or gain any\nimproper advantage. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws also may hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. These laws also require that we keep accurate books and records and maintain internal controls and\ncompliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have policies and procedures to address\ncompliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents will not take actions in violation of\nour policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held responsible, and our exposure for violating\nthese laws increases as our international presence expands and as we increase sales and operations in foreign\njurisdictions. Any violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money\nlaundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of\nsignificant legal fees, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment\nfrom U.S. government contracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or\noverall adverse consequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as federal and state regulations and laws\nspecifically governing the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and\nfuture laws and regulations, or changes thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce,\nor other online services, and increase the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business\npractices, or raise compliance costs or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue\nto evolve, may cover taxation, tariffs, user privacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content,\ncopyrights, distribution, social media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts\nand other communications, consumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and\nquality of services. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and\nother taxes, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to\nexpand internationally, it is possible that foreign government entities may seek to censor content available on our\nmobile applications or website or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and website. Any\nfailure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our\nreputation and brand, a loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n72\nTable of Contents\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the users on our platform, as well as\nother personal data relating to individuals such as our employees. Numerous local, municipal, state, federal, and\ninternational laws and regulations address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and\nprotection of certain types of data, including the California Online Privacy Protection Act, the Personal\nInformation Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and\nMarketing Act, Canada’s Anti-Spam Law, Australia’s Privacy Act, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (the “GDPR”), the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (the “TCPA”). Section 5 of the Federal Trade\nCommission Act, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”). These laws, rules, and regulations evolve\nfrequently and their scope may continually change, through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, and\nchanges in enforcement, and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another.\nIn the United States, the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, among other things, requires disclosures\nto California consumers, imposes obligations on businesses that process California consumers' personal information,\nand affords such consumers new rights, including the ability to opt out of certain sales of personal information.\nThe CCPA provides for fines of up to $7,500 per violation as well as a private right of action for certain data\nbreaches that result in the loss of personal information, which could increase the likelihood of, and risks\nassociated with, data breach litigation.\nThe CCPA continues to evolve and could require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and expose\nus to further regulatory or operational burdens. Also, the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”) was approved\nby California voters and significantly modifies the CCPA, resulting in further uncertainty and likely requiring us\nto incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply. The CPRA has created obligations relating to\npersonal information as of January 1, 2022, Other states have also enacted or proposed similar privacy laws. For\nexample in March 2021, Virginia enacted a Consumer Data Protection Act that will go into effect January 1, 2023,\nand Colorado enacted a Colorado Privacy Act that will go into effect July 1, 2023. In March 2022, Utah enacted a\nUtah Consumer Privacy Act that will go into effect December 31, 2023. All of these laws differ from the CPRA.\nSimilar laws are being considered by other state legislatures. This legislation and other proposed laws may add\nadditional complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions and potential legal risk, require additional\ninvestment of resources in compliance programs, impact strategies and the availability of data and could result in\nincreased compliance costs or changes in business practices and policies. In addition, all 50 states have laws\nincluding obligations to provide notification of security breaches involving personal data to affected individuals,\nstate officers and others.\nMoreover, we will become subject to additional countries’ privacy laws as we expand our international operations.\nFor example, with our November 2021 launch in Germany, we became subject to the GDPR, which imposes strict\nrequirements relating to the processing of personal data. European Union (\"EU\") member states have enacted\nlegislation that adds to or interprets the GDPR requirements and potentially extends our obligations and potential\nliability for failing to meet such obligations. Among other requirements, the GDPR regulates transfers of personal\ndata subject to the GDPR to the United States as well as other countries that have not been found to provide\nadequate protection to such personal data. The GDPR also affords greater control for data subjects (for example,\nthe “right to be forgotten”), increased data portability for data subjects, and data breach notification\nrequirements. Noncompliance is subject to significant penalties, which can include fines of up to the greater of\n€20 million or 4% of total worldwide revenue and injunctions against the processing of personal data. Such\npenalties are in addition to any civil litigation claims by customers and data subjects.\nIn addition to laws and regulations, we are subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data\nSecurity Standard, which requires companies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder\ninformation. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or\nconsequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, information security or consumer protection or any loss, unavailability or inadvertent or unauthorized\nuse, modification, disclosure, or other processing of data that we store or handle as part of operating our\nbusiness.\nWe have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in an effort to comply with privacy, data\nprotection, and information security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or\ncontractual obligations. In particular, with laws and regulations such as the CCPA, CPRA and GDPR imposing new and\nrelatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the interpretation and application of\nthese and other laws and regulations, we may face challenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary\nchanges to our policies and practices and may incur significant costs and expenses in an effort to do so.\n73\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, our success depends, in part, on our ability to access, collect and use data about and relating to\nDashers, merchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as “cookies,” is\nfurther restricted, regulated or blocked, the amount or accuracy of Internet user information we collect would\ndecrease, which could harm our business and results of operations. Federal, state, and foreign governmental\nauthorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the practice of online tracking for\nbehavioral advertising and other purposes. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted, have considered, or are\nconsidering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals\nto engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a\ncompany can employ electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. For example, the European\nCommission has proposed a draft regulation, known as the Regulation of Privacy and Electronic Communications (the\n“ePrivacy Regulation”), which would replace the current ePrivacy Directive. If adopted, the earliest date for entry\ninto force is in 2023, with broad potential impacts on the use of Internet-based services and tracking\ntechnologies, such as cookies. We expect to incur additional costs to comply with the requirements of the ePrivacy\nRegulation and national implementation laws once they are enacted . Additionally, on January 13, 2022, the Austrian\ndata protection authority published a decision ruling that the collection of personal data and transfer to the U.S.\nthrough Google Analytics and other analytics and tracking tools used by website operators violates the GDPR. On\nFebruary 10, 2022, the French data protection authority issued a press release that the French data protection\nauthority had issued a similar decision. Other data protection authorities in the EU increasingly are focused on\nthe use of online tracking tools and have indicated that they plan to issue similar rulings. In addition to the EU,\nother regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral\nadvertising ecosystem. For example, the CCPA grants California consumers the right to opt-out of a company’s\nsharing of personal information for advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration.\nMoreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented means to make it easier for Internet\nusers to block tracking technologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could,\nif widely adopted, significantly reduce the effectiveness of such practices and technologies. For example, Apple\nintroduced an iOS update in April 2021 that allowed users to more easily opt-out of tracking activity across\ndevices, which has impacted and may continue to impact business. In February 2022, Google announced it planned to\nadopt similar restrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices. As a result, we may have to\ndevelop alternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior, customize their online experience or efficiently\nmarket to them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and information security, it is possible that our interpretations of the law, practices, or platform\ncould be inconsistent with, or fail or be alleged to fail to meet all requirements of, such laws, regulations, or\nobligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors or merchants on our platform, to comply with applicable\nlaws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or information security, or any\ncompromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal data or other data\nrelating to Dashers, consumers, or other individuals, or the perception that any of the foregoing types of failure\nor compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation, discourage new and existing Dashers and consumers from\nusing our platform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims\nand litigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nEven if not subject to legal challenge, the perception of privacy concerns, whether or not valid, may harm our\nreputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of litigation resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to potential risks, including liabilities\nor claims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the TCPA restricts telemarketing and the use of\nautomated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and may in the future result, in civil\nclaims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text\nmessages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we\nbecome liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability and our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n74\nTable of Contents\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in GAAP.\nAccounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"GAAP\") are subject to interpretation by\nthe FASB, the SEC, and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A\nchange in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations\nand could affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement of a change. For example, in May\n2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Consumers\n(Topic 606)” (“ASC 606”), which superseded nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance, and in February 2016,\nthe FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (“ASC 842”), which increases lease transparency and\ncomparability among organizations. It is difficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles\nor our accounting policies, any of which could negatively affect our reported results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance\ncoverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their\nobligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies to cover various operations-related risks including auto liability,\nemployment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches,\ncrime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business\nliabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or future risks related to our new and evolving\nservices, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. In addition, we may not obtain enough\ninsurance to adequately mitigate such operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services,\nand we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain.\nAdditionally, if any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related\nclaims that we make. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of\ninsurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of\nthese merchant agreements.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould bear the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured\nretentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles\nfor many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase, or\nwe may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim,\npremiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we\nexperience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance\nclaims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided or (v) the number of claims under our\ndeductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third party and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily PayPal. Under our\ncommercial agreement with Stripe and PayPal respectively, each of these parties may terminate our relationship with\nadvanced notice. If Stripe terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on\ncommercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find an alternate payment processor and may not be able to\nsecure similar terms or replace such payment processor in an acceptable timeframe. Further, the software and\nservices provided by Stripe may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be\ncompromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments\nor other payment transactions or make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our\nbusiness for an extended period of time, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, and adversely\naffect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nNearly all payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment services,\nwhich subjects us to certain regulations and to the risk of fraud. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. We are also subject to a number of other laws\nand\n75\nTable of Contents\nregulations relating to the payments we accept from our consumers, including with respect to money laundering,\nmoney transfers, privacy, and information security. If we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable\nregulations, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or\ncriminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other\npayment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely\non data provided by Stripe for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in\nsuch data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nFurther, if we are deemed to be a money transmitter as defined by applicable law, we could become subject to\ncertain laws, rules, and regulations enforced by multiple authorities and governing bodies in the United States and\nnumerous state and local agencies that may define money transmitter differently. For example, certain states may\nhave a more expansive view of who qualifies as a money transmitter. Additionally, outside of the United States, we\ncould be subject to additional laws, rules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial\nservices, and if we expand into new jurisdictions, the foreign regulations governing our business that we are\nsubject to will expand as well. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulation and we\nare not in compliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties in one or more\njurisdictions levied by federal or state or local regulators. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply\nwith applicable rules and regulations could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make changes to our business practices or\ncompliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny.\nAdditionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating\nrules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new\noperating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain\nservices to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or\nregulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment\nprocessor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these\nrules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe currently host our platform and support our operations on a single datacenter provided by Amazon Web Services\n(“AWS”), a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services. We do not have control over the operations of the\nfacilities of AWS that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters,\ncybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. Our platform’s\ncontinuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success. We have experienced, and expect that in the\nfuture we will experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to\na variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and\ncapacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the\nrequirements of users on our platform. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to\nour success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform. It may become\nincreasingly difficult to maintain and improve our performance, especially during peak usage times, as we expand\nand the usage of our platform increases. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our\nreputation and brand and may adversely affect the usage of our platform. Any of the above circumstances or events\nmay harm our reputation and brand, reduce the availability or usage of our platform, lead to a significant short-\nterm loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the\nagreement for convenience by providing us at least thirty (30) days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the\nagreement for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a\n30-day cure period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice. Even\nthough our platform is entirely in the cloud, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud\ninfrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated\nor we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime for a\nshort period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers.\nHowever, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers\nwould cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations over the longer term.\n76\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we do not maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal\nand/or driving records of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those that are\nnot qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be\nadversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the\nrequirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its\nrelationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to\nfind an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable\ntimeframe. In certain jurisdictions, including the United States, we rely on a single third-party background check\nprovider for these jurisdictions. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms\nacceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less\nattractive to potential Dashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further,\nif the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise\nmeet our expectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we\nmay be unable to adequately protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified\nDashers may be inadvertently excluded from our platform. For example, we had a Dasher who had a criminal conviction\nthat should have excluded him from using our platform who was nonetheless cleared by one of our background check\nproviders, and as a result, we allowed him to make deliveries on our platform and he was subsequently alleged to\ncause personal injury to a merchant on our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation\nand brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In\naddition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we\nmay not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our\nplatform. In addition, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers do not meet\nthe requirements under applicable laws and regulations, we could face legal liability or negative publicity.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced non-material issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related\nto notice requirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be\nlimited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail\nto conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of\neligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By\nchoosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or\nregulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative\npublicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n77\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the\ndistribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the\nmapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all\nmapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping\nfunctions may not be reliable. From time to time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of\nour third-party software providers. If, in connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its\nrelationship with us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our\nplatform could be disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software\nthat we and Dashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software\non terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such\nsoftware, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or\ninferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not\ncontrol.\nWe have integrations with Stripe, Salesforce, Twilio, Wavefront, Snowflake, Olo, third-party offerings such as\nGoogle Maps and AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party applications, products, and services are\nconstantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with\nthird-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our\nplatform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or\nexert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nAs our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we face to increase. Should any of our\ncompetitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that\ndegrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our platform, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If we do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such\napplication marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that reduce\nthe effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial\nresults, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. Any\nchanges in such systems and application marketplaces that degrade the functionality of our applications or give\npreferential treatment to our competitors’ applications could adversely affect our platform’s usage on mobile\ndevices. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our\napplications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our\napplications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify\ntheir search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such\nmobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our applications, our\nuser growth could slow. Our applications have experienced fluctuations in the past, and we anticipate similar\nfluctuations in the future. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that certain mobile devices will\ncontinue to support our platform or effectively roll out updates to our applications. Additionally, in order to\ndeliver high-quality applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range\nof mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining\nrelationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’ experience. If merchants, consumers,\nor Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile\ndevices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our user growth\nand user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers and Dashers. For example, Apple has imposed new requirements\nfor consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and has implemented a new application tracking transparency\nframework that\n78\nTable of Contents\nrequires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google announced it planned to adopt\nrestrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes have, and we expect that these\nchanges will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions because they will\nlimit our visibility into the performance of specific advertising channels. If we are unable to mitigate the\neffects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates from\nexisting consumers on our platform, which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new consumer growth could decline and our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected if we fail to appear prominently in\nsearch results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search\nengines like Google, Yahoo!, and Bing. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is\ndue in large part to how and where our website ranks in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a\nnumber of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search\nengine may change its ranking algorithms, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our website may\nnot be prominent enough to drive traffic to our website, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Our website has experienced\nfluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any\nreduction in the number of consumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on information from\nthird-party sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such\nsources or the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and\ninformation may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including general expectations\nconcerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size,\nare based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of\nassumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we\nhave not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or\nthe methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or\nmethodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover\nmaterial inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, our reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\n79\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate. Also, applicable laws or regulations could force us to disclose our intellectual property, such as our\ntrade secrets and other proprietary information. For example, the City Council of New York passed a law which went\ninto effect in December 2021 that would require us to provide customer data, such as names, phone numbers, emails\nand delivery addresses, to restaurants merchants for orders on our platform in New York City, unless a customer\nopts out. We have filed a lawsuit challenging this law, and New York City has agreed not to enforce the law against\nus during the pendency of the litigation. If our lawsuit is not successful, complying with this law could have an\nadverse effect on our intellectual property or result in harm to our reputation or brand.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions. Competitors have and may continue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our\nability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade\nname or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks.\nLitigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not\ntimely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property.\nOur efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n80\nTable of Contents\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com.\nIf we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable\nregistration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could\ncause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in\nquestion. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of\nreasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using\ndomain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that\ninfringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks.\nProtecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses,\nbe required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software\nlicense. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and\nultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. Alternatively, to avoid the release of the\naffected portions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial\ntime, and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our\nsoftware until we can adequately address the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nFrom time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that\nincorporate open source software into their solutions. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties\nclaiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to\nfully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or\nother liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on\nterms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our\nplatform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source\ncode form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\n81\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure, or acquire\ncomplementary businesses and technologies. We believe our working capital will be sufficient to meet our\nanticipated operating cash needs for at least the next twelve (12) months and beyond. From time to time, we may\nseek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives or investments and our\nongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or\nconvertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we\nissue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We\nevaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other\nthings, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance and the condition of the capital\nmarkets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us,\nif at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require\nit, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired,\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility includes a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock,\nmake investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving\ncredit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance\nour future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for\nus to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies\nwhich are not subject to such restrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to\nrefinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our\nbusiness, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing,\nit may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of March 31, 2022, no\namounts were drawn from the revolving credit facility.\n82\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has twenty (20) votes per share, and our\nClass C common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all\nof the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of March 31, 2022, Tony Xu, our co-founder,\nChief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer\nEngineering, and a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a\nmember of our board of directors collectively held 65% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in\naggregate, which voting power may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity\nawards (including those equity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to the IPO and subject to equity exchange\nright agreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any\nshares of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or\nthe vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of\nClass B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had\nbeen exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of March 31, 2022, our Co-Founders\nwould collectively hold 75% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-Founders have also entered\ninto the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and\nvote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and\npermitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will\nbe able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including\nthe election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,\nand the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major\ncorporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you\ndisagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,\npreventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to\nreceive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market\nprice of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause\nconflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in Mr. Xu undertaking,\nor causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or our Co-Founders but would not be\ndesirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one (1) share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed\nby our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the first\ndate on which the number of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible\ninstruments, held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B\ncommon stock held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our IPO, which\nwe sometimes refer to herein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold\"; (ii) twelve (12) months after the death or permanent\nand total disability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted\nas directed by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors(or if there is no such person,\nthen our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than sixty-one\n(61) days and no more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our\namended and restated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no\nless than sixty-one (61) days and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer\nproviding services to us as an officer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board\nof directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr.\nXu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We\nrefer to the date on which such final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the\nterms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date\".\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually\n83\nTable of Contents\nresult in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power, Mr. Xu would no longer\nhave the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted for\na vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock have no voting rights (except as required by\nlaw), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution, which would prolong the voting\ncontrol of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to Mr. Xu would also delay the\nfinal conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class C common stock issued to\nMr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met. As a result, the\nissuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our voting power and\nhis ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our\nstockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our Co-Founders and, in that event,\nthey would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their holdings without\ndiminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will not be subject to\napproval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York\nStock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail\nourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2021, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of\nthe voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a\n“controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange\nregarding corporate governance, including:\nthe requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\nthe requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent\ndirectors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance\nevaluation of the committee; and\nthe requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written\ncharter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee,\nand the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal\nadvisors, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled\ncompany” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these\nexemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the\nNew York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the\nprotections for other stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our\nClass A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers\nhave announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices.\nIn July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater\nthan 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it\nwill no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices\ninclude the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P\nComposite 1500. Also in 2017, MSCI, a leading stock index provider, opened public consultations on their treatment\nof no-vote and multi-class structures and temporarily barred new multi-class listings from certain of its indices\nand in October 2018, MSCI announced its decision to include equity securities “with unequal voting structures” in\nits indices and to launch a new index that specifically includes voting rights in its eligibility criteria. Under\nsuch announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain\nindices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds,\n84\nTable of Contents\nand other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock.\nThese policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the valuations of\npublicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as\ncompared to similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive\nstrategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude\ninvestment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a\nresult, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors, such as\nour announcement of the pending acquisition of Wolt;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\n85\nTable of Contents\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we previously filed a registration statement to register\nshares reserved for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction\nof applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of\noutstanding RSU awards will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\n86\nTable of Contents\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint\nasserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our\namended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such\nclaims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us,\nour business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely,\nthe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative\nrecommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price\nof our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of\nthese analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the\nfinancial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of\nour Class A common stock to decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any\ndividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.\n87\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Our Proposed Acquisition of Wolt\nThe proposed acquisition of Wolt (the \"Transaction\") will not be completed unless the conditions are satisfied or\nwaived. If the Transaction is not completed, our and Wolt’s future business and financial results could be\nnegatively affected.\nOn November 9, 2021, we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire Wolt. Our and Wolt’s obligations to\nconsummate the Transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions. These conditions\ninclude, among other customary conditions, receipt of certain specified regulatory approvals, the absence of\ncertain laws or orders prohibiting or making illegal the Transaction, effectiveness of the registration statement\non Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844) registering the shares of our Class A common stock issuable to the Wolt\nshareholders and holders of outstanding and unexercised vested options to purchase shares of Wolt class A common\nstock (\"Wolt Vested Optionholders\", jointly referred to as \"Seller\") as consideration in the Transaction, approval\nof a prospectus under Finnish law by the Finnish authorities, if required pursuant to applicable laws, execution of\nan escrow agreement by the parties and an escrow agent related to the escrow of certain shares to secure the\nSellers’ indemnification obligations, no event occurring that had or would reasonably be expected to result in a\nDoorDash Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the DoorDash Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844)) or a Wolt Material\nAdverse Effect (as defined in the DoorDash Form S-4 (File No. 333-261844)), compliance by the parties with their\ncovenants in the Share Purchase Agreement, dated November 9, 2021 (as the same may be amended from time to time,\nthe \"Share Purchase Agreement\") in all material respects, the accuracy of representations and warranties made by us\nor Wolt, and certain conditions related to key employees and the lockup agreements entered into by certain Wolt\nstockholders (the “Lockup Agreements\").\nIn addition, if the Transaction is not completed by the termination date specified in the Share Purchase Agreement,\nor certain other events have occurred that prevent the closing conditions from being satisfied, either we or Wolt\nmay choose to terminate the Share Purchase Agreement. We or Wolt may also elect to terminate the Share Purchase\nAgreement in certain other circumstances, and the parties can mutually decide to terminate the Share Purchase\nAgreement at any time prior to the closing of the Transaction. There is no assurance that the Transaction will be\nconsummated.\nIf the Transaction is delayed, terminated or otherwise not completed, DoorDash and Wolt would not realize any of\nthe expected benefits of the Transaction and may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our or\nWolt’s business, results of operations and stock price, including, among others:\nunder certain circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee of €210 million;\nDoorDash and Wolt will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to the Transaction, including, as\napplicable, professional fees and expenses, fees and costs relating to regulatory filings and notices, and other\ntransaction-related costs, fees and expenses. These costs are payable by DoorDash and Wolt whether or not the\nTransaction is complete. If the Transaction is not completed, DoorDash and Wolt will have incurred substantial\nexpenses for which no ultimate benefit will have been received by DoorDash or Wolt;\nmatters related to the Transaction (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and\nresources by our and Wolt’s management teams and numerous others throughout our and Wolt’s organizations, which\ncould otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities;\nwe may acquire a majority but less than all of the outstanding shares in the Transaction, which may result in\nobligations to the minority shareholders of Wolt or additional expenses and obligations in connection with, and\nfollowing, the Transaction;\nDoorDash and Wolt may be subject to legal proceedings related to the Transaction or the failure to complete the\nTransaction, which could be time consuming and expensive, could divert DoorDash's and Wolt’s managements’ attention\naway from their regular business and, if any lawsuit is adversely resolved against DoorDash or Wolt, could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on their financial condition;\na delay in completing the Transaction, or failure to complete the Transaction, negative perceptions about the\nTransaction, or other factors beyond DoorDash’s and Wolt’s control, may result in negative publicity and a negative\nperception of DoorDash and/or Wolt in the investment community, and could negatively impact on our stock price; and\nany disruptions to our or Wolt’s businesses resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Transaction,\nincluding any adverse changes in DoorDash’s or Wolt’s relationships with their respective customers, suppliers,\npartners or employees, may continue to intensify in the event the Transaction is not consummated.\n88\nTable of Contents\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt may subject us to certain liabilities associated with Wolt or\nliabilities that may arise in connection with the completion of the transaction.\nThe Transaction and the integration of Wolt with us may pose special risks, including write-offs or restructuring\ncharges, unanticipated costs, and the loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that the integration will be\naccomplished effectively or in a timely manner. In addition, the Transaction and the integration of Wolt will\nsubject us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the completion of the Transaction,\nsome of which may be unknown. Although we and our advisers have conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt\nand we have certain rights of indemnification, including an escrow of shares to secure certain obligations Wolt's\nsecurityholders under the Share Purchase Agreement, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities\nof Wolt or that the amounts in escrow will be sufficient. Further, the escrow consists of shares and therefore,\neven if we are able to recover from the escrow, we will need to use our cash and resources to pay for the\nliabilities and damages. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the transaction\nnot currently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact\nour business, financial condition and results of operations, including our profitability. Further, Wolt’s business\nis different in certain ways from ours, and our results of operations may as a result be affected by factors that\ndiffer from those currently affecting our results of operations.\nOur and Wolt’s business relationships may be subject to disruption due to uncertainty associated with the\nTransaction, which could have an adverse effect on our and Wolt’s results of operations, cash flows and financial\nposition.\nParties with which we and Wolt do business may experience uncertainty associated with the Transaction, including\nwith respect to current or future business relationships with us, Wolt or the combined company following the\ncompletion of the transaction. Our and Wolt’s relationships may be subject to disruption as merchants, Dashers and\ncouriers, and other persons with whom we and/or Wolt have a business relationship may have concerns about a larger,\nmore international organization, or otherwise, and may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to\nseek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Wolt, as applicable, or consider entering\ninto business relationships with parties other than us or Wolt. These disruptions could have an adverse effect on\nthe results of operations, cash flows and financial position of us, Wolt or the combined company following the\ncompletion of the transaction, including an adverse effect on our ability to realize the expected benefits of the\ntransaction. The risk, and adverse effect, of any disruption could be exacerbated by a delay in the completion of\nor failure to complete the transaction.\nUncertainties associated with the Transaction may cause a loss of management personnel and other key employees, and\nDoorDash and the combined company may have difficulty attracting and motivating management personnel and other key\nemployees, which could adversely affect the future businesses and operations of DoorDash and the combined company.\nDoorDash and Wolt are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of their respective management personnel\nand other key employees to execute their business plans. The combined company’s success after the completion of the\nTransaction will depend in part upon the ability of DoorDash and Wolt to attract, motivate and retain key\nmanagement personnel and other key employees. Prior to completion of the Transaction, current and prospective\nemployees of DoorDash and Wolt may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following\nthe completion of the Transaction, which may have an adverse effect on the ability of each of DoorDash and Wolt to\nattract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees. In addition, no assurance can be given\nthat DoorDash will be able to attract, motivate or retain management personnel and other key employees of DoorDash\nand Wolt to the same extent that DoorDash and Wolt have previously been able to attract or retain their own\nemployees. If key employees terminate their employment, DoorDash’s business activities may be adversely affected\nand management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating DoorDash and Wolt to hiring suitable\nreplacements, all of which may cause DoorDash’s business to suffer.\nWolt is subject to numerous legal and regulatory regimes and the combined business could be harmed by changes to,\nor the interpretation or the application of, the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which it\noperates.\nWolt is also subject to a number of legal and compliance risks, and these risks may adversely affect the combined\ncompany after completion of the Transaction. Wolt operates in twenty-three (23) countries in Europe and Asia,\nincluding, among others, Japan, Finland, Denmark, Hungary, Germany and Israel. The international scope of Wolt’s\nbusiness will require us to comply with a wide range of EU-level, national and local laws and regulations, which\nmay in certain cases diverge from or even conflict with each other.\n89\nTable of Contents\nWolt’s business principally consists of providing an online local commerce platform and enabling people to get the\nsame Wolt delivery experience from virtually any type of merchant (which in the case of Wolt includes, among\nothers, restaurants, grocery stores, retail shops and boutiques), including operating its own Wolt Market grocery\nstores. With the geographic expansion of DoorDash’s business and that of its subsidiaries, including Wolt after the\nconsummation of the Transaction, into new markets, DoorDash will become subject to additional and changing legal,\nregulatory, tax, licensing, and compliance requirements and industry standards with respect to local on-demand\ndelivery providers.\nIn countries where DoorDash and Wolt operate, legislators and regulatory authorities may introduce new\ninterpretations of existing laws and regulations or introduce new legislation or regulations concerning the\nbusiness of DoorDash and/or Wolt, e.g., the independent contractor model for couriers. Changes in government\nregulation of or successful challenges to the independent contractor model used by Wolt in certain markets may\nrequire Wolt to change its existing business models and operations. Any additional regulatory scrutiny or changes\nin legal requirements may impose significant compliance costs and make it uneconomical for the combined company to\ncontinue to operate in all of the current markets or to expand in accordance with our strategy, particularly if\nregulations or their interpretations vary greatly or conflict between different operating countries. This may\nnegatively impact Wolt’s or our revenue and profitability by preventing our or Wolt’s business from reaching\nsufficient scale in particular markets or having to change its business model or incur additional costs, which\nwould adversely impact the combined company after the completion of the transaction. Our inability, or perceived\ninability, to comply with existing or new compliance obligations, could lead to regulatory scrutiny, which could\nresult in administrative or enforcement action, such as fines, penalties, and/or enforceable undertakings and\nadversely affect the combined company after the completion of the transaction.\nThe Transaction and the expansion of the combined company may lead to an increase in competitive pressure from both\nexisting competitors and new entrants in the already highly competitive on-demand local commerce industry.\nAs a result of the Transaction, DoorDash, through the operations of Wolt, will operate in a greater geographical\narea than it does currently. A number of competitors both in Europe and Asia offer local commerce services similar\nto those offered by DoorDash and Wolt. Existing competitors and new entrants in this space in Europe and Asia may\nengage in aggressive consumer acquisition campaigns, develop superior offerings or consolidate with other entities\nand achieve benefits of scale. Such competitive pressures in an already highly competitive market may materially\nerode Wolt’s existing market share and negatively impact Wolt’s revenue, and may hinder Wolt’s expansion into new\nmarkets, which could adversely impact the combined company after the completion of the transaction.\nFollowing the completion of the Transaction, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will\nbe increased.\nWe are currently subject to some foreign currency exchange risk because we conduct business operations in several\nforeign countries through our foreign subsidiaries, which conduct business in their respective local currencies.\nWolt conducts a significant portion of its operations outside of the United States through its subsidiaries or\naffiliates, which also operate in their respective local currencies, the most significant of which are currently\nthe Euro, the Japanese Yen and the Israeli Shekel. Therefore, following the completion of the Transaction, our\ninternational operations will account for a more significant portion of our overall operations than they do\npresently and our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates will increase. Because our financial\nstatements will continue to be presented in U.S. dollars subsequent to the completion of the transaction, the local\ncurrencies will be translated into U.S. dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated\nfinancial statements, thereby increasing the foreign exchange translation risk.\nWe may be targeted by securities class action and derivative lawsuits that could result in substantial costs and\nmay delay or prevent the Transaction from being completed.\nSecurities class action lawsuits and derivative lawsuits are often brought against public companies that have\nentered into share purchase agreements. Even if the lawsuits are without merit, defending against these claims can\nresult in substantial costs and divert management time and resources. An adverse judgment could result in monetary\ndamages, which could have a negative impact on our liquidity and financial condition. Additionally, if a plaintiff\nis successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting completion of the Transaction, then that injunction may delay\nor prevent the Transaction from being completed, or from being completed within the expected timeframe, which may\nadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation. Currently, neither we nor Wolt is\naware of any securities class action lawsuits or derivative lawsuits having been filed in connection with the\nTransaction.\n90\nTable of Contents\nThe Transaction may be completed even though a material adverse effect may result from the announcement of the\nTransaction, industry-wide changes or other causes.\nIn general, either party can refuse to complete the Transaction if there is a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect or a\nWolt Material Adverse Effect (each as defined in the Share Purchase Agreement) affecting the other party prior to\nthe closing. However, some types of changes that would result in a material adverse effect of either party are\nexcluded from the definitions of a DoorDash Material Adverse Effect or a Wolt Material Adverse Effect, and do not\npermit either party to refuse to complete the Transaction. If such adverse changes occur but we and Wolt still\ncomplete the Transaction, the market price of our Class A common stock may suffer.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may decline as a result of the Transaction, if, among other things, we\nare unable to achieve the expected growth in earnings, or if the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost\nsavings, innovation and operational efficiencies, from the Transaction are not realized, or if the transaction\ncosts related to the Transaction are greater than expected. The market price may also decline if we do not achieve\nthe perceived benefits of the Transaction as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by investors or financial or\nindustry analysts or if the effect of the Transaction on our financial position, results of operations or cash\nflows is not consistent with the expectations of investors or financial or industry analysts. The issuance of\nshares of our Class A common stock in the Transaction could on its own have the effect of depressing the market\nprice for our Class A common stock. A portion of the shares of Class A common stock to be issued in the Transaction\n(including shares to be issued upon exercise of vested options) will be available for immediate sale in the United\nStates on the open market. Many Wolt shareholders and holders of vested options may decide to sell the shares of\nour Class A common stock they receive as a result of the Transaction (including shares received upon exercise of\nvested options), including sales to cover their tax obligations arising as part of the transaction. Other Wolt\nshareholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be\nrequired to sell the shares of our Class A common stock they receive as a result of the Transaction. Accordingly,\nwe expect that the volume of sales of shares of our Class A common stock will increase shortly after the closing of\nthe Transaction and this increased volume may have the effect of depressing our stock price or causing volatility\nin our stock price. Moreover, general fluctuations in stock markets could have a material adverse effect on the\nmarket for, or liquidity of, the our Class A common stock, regardless of the actual operating performance of the\ncombined company.\nCompletion of the Transaction may trigger change in control, assignment or other provisions in certain agreements\nto which Wolt or its subsidiaries are a party, which may have an adverse impact on the combined company’s business\nand results of operations.\nThe completion of the Transaction may trigger change in control, assignment and other provisions in certain\nagreements to which Wolt or its subsidiaries are a party. If DoorDash and Wolt are unable to negotiate waivers of,\nor consents under, those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the\nagreements, potentially terminating the agreements, seeking monetary damages or other remedies. Even if DoorDash\nand Wolt are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to\nrenegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to DoorDash. Any of the foregoing or similar developments may\nhave an adverse impact on the businesses, financial condition and results of operations of DoorDash following the\ncompletion of the transaction, or the ability to successfully integrate their respective businesses and/or execute\ntheir respective strategies.\n91\nTable of Contents",

We also used a portion of the net proceeds to repay our 2020\nconvertible notes. Additionally, we used a portion of the net proceeds we received from our IPO to satisfy a\nportion of our tax withholding and remittance obligations related to the vesting and/or settlement of certain RSUs\nthat we have granted.
