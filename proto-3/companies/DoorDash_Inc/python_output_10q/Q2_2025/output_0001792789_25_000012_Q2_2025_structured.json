Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries and entities consolidated under the variable interest entity model, and have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and\nthe requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim reporting. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that\nare, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. They should be\nread in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results for a full year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make\ncertain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\nrelated disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances\nfor credit losses, gift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and\nwebsite development costs, intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and\nother financial instruments including valuation of investments without readily determinable fair values, valuation\nof acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, impairment\nof long-lived assets, insurance reserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could\ndiffer from these estimates.\n11\nTable of Contents\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies from its Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, except for the accounting policy noted below.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with ASC 815, \"Derivatives and Hedging \" ,\nwhich establishes accounting and reporting for derivative instruments, including economic hedges. Accordingly, any\ngains or losses related to the derivative instruments used as economic hedges are recognized in earnings. Cash\nflows are recorded in the same section as the cash flows of the related hedged item.Refer to Note 14 - \"Derivative\"\nfor further information.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update 2024-03,\n\"Income Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income - Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40):\nDisaggregation of Income Statement Expenses\" (\"ASU 2024-03\"), which requires disclosure, on an annual and interim\nbasis, of specified information about certain costs and expenses in the notes to financial statements. ASU 2024-03\nwill be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2026, and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of\nthe adoption of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\n3. Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomposed of the Company's Marketplaces and Commerce Platform.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of the Company's\nmembership products, the address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended June 30,                   Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024        2025                            2024        2025\nUnited States       $                        2,318    $  2,829    $                      4,540    $  5,485\nInternational(1)                               312         455                             603         831\nTotal revenue       $                        2,630    $  3,284    $                      5,143    $  6,316\n(1) No individual country outside the United States represented 10% or more of total consolidated revenue for the\nperiods presented.\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets, is primarily composed of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from\nconsumers and merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized\nover time. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the six months ended June 30, 2025 was as\nfollows (in millions):\nSix Months Ended June 30, 2025\nBeginning balance                          $                             396\nAddition to contract liabilities                                       1,695\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                               -1,670\nEnding balance                             $                             421\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore,\n12\nTable of Contents\nthe amount recognized as revenue related to the reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than\nthe amount presented in the table above. Net revenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not\ntracked by the Company as it is impracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 228million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, of which $ 187million was recognized as revenue during the six months ended June 30, 2025.\nThe ending balance of unearned prepayments is expected to be recognized as revenue in 12 months or less.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors.

Acquisitions\nSevenRooms Acquisition\nOn June 13, 2025, the Company completed the acquisition of 100percent of the outstanding equity interests of\nSevenRooms Inc. (“SevenRooms”), which was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The acquisition\nwill enhance the Company's platform by equipping merchants with tools to manage reservations and tables, better\nconnect with consumers through customer relationship management, and improve their marketing. The Company’s\nacquisition-related costs for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 were $ 13million. All costs were\nrecorded as general and administrative expenses on the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations\nduring the\n13\nTable of Contents\nperiod in which they were incurred. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred for SevenRooms\nwas $ 1,152million, which consisted of the following (in millions):\nFair Value\nCash                           $         902\nDeferred cash consideration              250\nTotal consideration            $       1,152\nAs of June 30 2025, the Company had settled $ 162million in deferred cash consideration, with $ 88million remaining\nto be settled in future periods. For certain SevenRooms employees, a portion of their total consideration was held\nback subject to revesting. A total of $ 38million of these employees’ holdback was included as part of the deferred\ncash consideration and the remaining $ 56million represents compensation for post-combination services to be\nrecognized over the service period.\nThe total purchase consideration of the SevenRooms acquisition was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets\nacquired, and liabilities assumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of the acquisition. The\nCompany recorded $ 845million of goodwill which represents the excess of the purchase price over the net assets\nacquired. Goodwill is primarily attributed to the assembled workforce of SevenRooms and anticipated synergies\narising from potential future growth and an enhanced platform to help merchants serve their customers across all\nchannels. The goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of SevenRooms is not deductible for tax\npurposes. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s best estimates,\njudgments and assumptions, and are considered preliminary pending finalization of the valuation analyses pertaining\nto assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which primarily relate to acquired intangible assets. The Company\nexpects to finalize the allocation of the purchase price as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from\nthe acquisition date when the measurement period ends.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the\nacquisition date (in millions):\nJune 13, 2025\nCurrent assets                 $             30\nIntangible assets                           362\nGoodwill                                    845\nOther non-current assets                      2\nCurrent liabilities                         -62\nDeferred tax liability, net                 -25\nTotal                          $          1,152\nThe following table sets forth the components of intangible assets acquired (in millions) and their estimated\nuseful lives as of the date of acquisition (in years):\nEstimated Useful\nLife       June 13, 2025\nExisting technology                                6    $            137\nStrategic customer relationships                  14                 165\nOther customer relationships                       7                  54\nTrade name                                         4                   6\nTotal acquired intangible assets                        $            362\nExisting technology represents the online and mobile SevenRooms platform for reservations, table management, and\nguest engagement. The customer relationships represent the fair value of the underlying relationships with its\ncustomers, including strategic customers such as global hotel chains and casino resorts, and small and mid-size\nbusinesses. The estimated fair values of the developed technology and trade name were determined using the relief-\nfrom royalty method of the income approach. The estimated fair values of the customer relationships were determined\nusing the multi-period excess earnings method of the income approach. The Company expects to amortize the fair\nvalue of these intangible assets on a straight-line basis over their respective estimated useful lives.\n14\nTable of Contents\nFrom the date of acquisition through June 30, 2025, revenue and net loss attributable to SevenRooms, included in\nthe Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations was not material.

(“Symbiosys”), a retail media platform company, to expand\noffsite advertising capabilities. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting.\nThe acquisition date fair value of the purchase consideration was $ 121million, which consisted of the following\n(in millions):\nFair Value\nCash                                             $          89\nDeferred cash consideration                                 29\nFair value of previously held equity interest                3\nTotal purchase consideration                     $         121\nAs of June 30 2025, the Company had settled $ 5million in deferred cash consideration, with $ 24million remaining\nto be settled in future periods. For certain Symbiosys employees, a portion of their total consideration was\nrestricted subject to vesting over various service periods. A total of $ 14million of these employees’\nconsideration was included as part of the deferred cash consideration and the remaining $ 53million represents\ncompensation for post-combination services to be recognized over their respective service periods.\nThe total purchase consideration was allocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities\nassumed, based upon their respective fair values as of the date of acquisition. The excess of the purchase\nconsideration over the net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is primarily attributable to the\nanticipated synergies from the planned expansion into additional digital channels to extend the breadth of the\nCompany’s marketing channels. The goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of Symbiosys is not\ndeductible for tax purposes. The fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on management’s\nbest estimates, judgments and assumptions, and are considered preliminary pending finalization of the valuation\nanalyses pertaining to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, which primarily relate to acquired intangible\nassets. The measurement period will end no later than one-year from the acquisition date.\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition\ndate (in millions):\nMay 28, 2025\nCurrent assets         $             7\nIntangible assets                   19\nGoodwill                           102\nCurrent liabilities                 -5\nOther liabilities                   -2\nTotal                  $           121\nThe intangible assets acquired consisted of existing technology of $ 17million and customer relationships of $\n2million, which had estimated useful lives of 4and 3years as of the date of the acquisition, respectively.\nThe acquisition was not material to the Company for the periods presented and therefore, pro forma information has\nnot been presented.\nOther Acquisition\nDuring the three months ended March 31, 2025, the Company acquired a company, which was accounted for under the\nacquisition method of accounting. The total purchase consideration was approximately $ 28million, which was\nallocated to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair\nvalues as of the acquisition date. Intangible assets acquired were primarily composed of customer relationships and\nvendor relationships.\n15\nTable of Contents\nAdditionally, the Company recorded $ 21million of goodwill, which represented the excess of the purchase price over\nthe net assets acquired.\n5.

Refer to Note 8 -\n\"Convertible Notes, Net\" for the carrying amount and fair value of the 2030 Notes.\nAssets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nThe Company’s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the measurement alternative are recorded at fair\nvalue on a non-recurring basis. When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes in a same or\nsimilar security from the same issuer occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable\ntransaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs. Non-marketable equity securities are\nrecorded in other assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the three and six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, the Company did not record any material upward or\ndownward adjustments or impairments on its non-marketable equity securities.\nEstimating the fair value of the Company’s investments in non-marketable equity securities requires the use of\nestimates and judgments. Changes in estimates and judgments could result in different estimates of fair value and\nfuture adjustments.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying value of the Company's non-marketable equity securities as of December\n31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, including impairments and cumulative upward and downward adjustments made to the\ninitial cost basis of the securities, which were recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations during the period in which they were incurred (in millions):\nDecember 31,       June 30,\n2024           2025\nInitial cost basis                    $           450    $       451\nUpward adjustments                                 11             11\nDownward adjustments (including                  -419           -421\nimpairment)\nTotal carrying value at the end of    $            42    $        41\nreporting period\n18\nTable of Contents\n7.

Convertible Notes, Net\n2030 Notes\nIn May 2025, the Company issued $ 2.75billion aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior Notes due 2030\n(the “2030 Notes”). The total proceeds from the issuance of the 2030 Notes, net of debt issuance costs, were\napproximately $ 2.72billion.\nThe 2030 Notes are senior, unsecured obligations of the Company and will mature on May 15, 2030, unless earlier\nrepurchased, redeemed, or converted, and are governed by the terms of an indenture (the \"Indenture\"), dated as of\nMay 30, 2025, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. The 2030 Notes do\nnot bear regular cash interest. Special interest and additional interest, if any, may accrue on the 2030 Notes at a\ncombined rate per annum not exceeding 0.50% upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the failure to file\ncertain reports with the SEC or to remove certain restrictive legends from the 2030 Notes.\nHolders of the 2030 Notes may convert all or any portion of their 2030 Notes at their option prior to November 15,\n2029, under the following circumstances:\na. during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) commencing after the calendar quarter ending\non September 30, 2025, if the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeds 130%\nof the conversion price for each of at least 20trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the 30consecutive\ntrading days ending on, and including, the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter;\nb. during the 5consecutive business days after any 10consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per\n$1,000 principal amount of the 2030 Notes for each trading day of such 10-day period was less than 98% of the\nproduct of the last reported sale price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock and the conversion rate on\neach such trading day; or\nc. upon the occurrence of specified corporate events or distributions on the Company’s Class A common stock, in\neach case, as set forth in the Indenture.\nHolders of the 2030 Notes may also convert their 2030 Notes (i) if the Company calls such 2030 Notes for\nredemption; and (ii) at any time on or after November 15, 2029 until the close of business on the second scheduled\ntrading day immediately before the maturity date.\nUpon conversion of any 2030 Notes, the conversion value will be paid in cash up to at least the principal amount of\nthe 2030 Notes being converted. Any amount of the conversion value in excess of the principal portion of such 2030\nNotes may be settled in cash or shares of the Company’s Class A common stock, or a combination thereof, at the\nCompany’s option. The 2030 Notes are convertible at an initial conversion rate of 3.425 shares of the Company's\nClass A common stock per $1,000 principal amount of the 2030 Notes, which is equivalent to an initial conversion\nprice of approximately $ 291.97per share of the Company's Class A common stock. The conversion rate may be subject\nto certain anti-dilution adjustments and/or a make-whole adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events set\nforth in the Indenture. As of June 30, 2025, there have been no changes to the initial conversion price of the 2030\nNotes since the issuance date.\n21\nTable of Contents\nBased on the closing price of the Company’s Class A common stock of $ 246.51on the last trading day of the quarter,\nthe if-converted value of the 2030 Notes did not exceed the principal value of the 2030 Notes as of June 30, 2025.\nThe Company may not redeem the notes prior to May 20, 2028. The 2030 Notes will be redeemable, in whole or in part\n(subject to certain limitations set forth in the Indenture), for cash, at the Company’s option, on or after May 20,\n2028 and on or before the 20th scheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date, but only if (i) the 2030\nNotes are “Freely Tradable” (as defined in the Indenture), and all accrued and unpaid additional interest, if any,\nhas been paid as of the date the Company sends the related redemption notice and (ii) the last reported sale price\nper share of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price on each of at least 20trading\ndays (whether or not consecutive) including the last trading day, during the 30consecutive trading days ending on,\nand including, the trading day immediately before the date the Company sends such redemption notice. The redemption\nprice will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid\nspecial interest and additional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the redemption date. In addition, calling any\n2030 Note for redemption will constitute a \"Make-Whole Fundamental Change\" (as defined in the Indenture) with\nrespect to such 2030 Note, in which case the conversion rate applicable to the conversion of such 2030 Note will be\nincreased in certain circumstances if it is converted after it is called for redemption.\nIf the Company undergoes a “Fundamental Change” (as defined in the Indenture), then holders of the 2030 Notes may\nrequire the Company to repurchase for cash all or any portion of their 2030 Notes at a repurchase price equal to\n100% of the principal amount of the 2030 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special interest and\nadditional interest, if any, to, but excluding, the fundamental change repurchase date.\nThe Indenture contains customary events of default and limited covenants. No sinking fund is required to be\nprovided for the 2030 Notes.\nAs of June 30, 2025, none of the conditions described in the paragraphs above relating to convertibility or\nmandatory redemption were met. Therefore, the 2030 Notes are classified as long-term debt.\nThe net carrying value, net of the 2030 Notes consisted of the following as of June 30, 2025 (in millions):\nJune 30,\n2025\nPrincipal                                   $     2,750\nLess:                                                    -29\ndebt issuance costs, net of amortization\nCarrying value, net                         $     2,721\nThe effective interest rate of the 2030 Notes is 0.22% per annum. The fair value of the 2030 Notes was $ 3.0billion\nas of June 30, 2025 and was determined based on the quote price in markets that are not active, which is considered\na Level 2 valuation input.\n2030 Note Hedges and Warrant Transactions\nIn May 2025, in connection with the offering of the 2030 Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated\nconvertible note hedge transactions whereby the Company has the option to purchase an initial total of\napproximately 9.4million shares of its Class A common stock at an initial strike price of approximately $ 291.97per\nshare (the “Note Hedges”). The total cost of the Note Hedges was approximately $ 680million.\nIn addition, the Company sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase an initial\ntotal of approximately 9.4million shares of the Company’s Class A common stock at an initial strike price of $\n512.225per share (the “Warrants”). The Company received approximately $ 341million in cash proceeds from the sale\nof the Warrants.\nBoth the number of shares underlying the Note Hedges and the Warrants and the strike prices of the instruments are\nsubject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The Note Hedges are expected generally to reduce potential dilution\nto the Company's Class A common stock upon the conversion of any 2030 Notes and/or offset any cash payments the\nCompany is required to make in excess of the principal amount of any converted 2030 Notes, as the case may be, to\nthe extent the market price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeds the then-applicable strike\nprice of the Note Hedges. The Warrants may separately have a dilutive effect with respect to the Company’s Class A\ncommon stock to the extent the market price per share of the Company’s Class A common stock exceeds the then-\napplicable strike price of the Warrants, unless the Company elects, subject to certain conditions, to settle the\nWarrants in cash.\n22\nTable of Contents\nThe Note Hedges and the Warrants are equity-classified instruments as a result of being indexed to the Company’s\nClass A common stock and meeting equity classification criteria, and the instruments will not be remeasured in\nsubsequent periods as long as they continue to meet these accounting criteria. The net cost of approximately $\n339million for the purchase of the Note Hedges and sale of the Warrants was recorded as a reduction to additional\npaid-in capital in the Company’s condensed consolidated balance sheets.\n9. Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company is a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business. Although\nthe results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes that the\nfinal outcome of ongoing matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and\ninquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices,\nthe classification and compensation of Dashers, the DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with consumer protection\nlaws, privacy, cybersecurity, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and other\nmatters. For example, the Company is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of\nCalifornia (the “CA EDD”) for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued an assessment for certain\namounts that it found to be owed by the Company on behalf of Dashers due to their being classified as independent\ncontractors. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously appeal such adverse\nassessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is uncertain and, accordingly, the Company has recorded\nan accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets as of June 30, 2025. The results of investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries and related\ngovernmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit,\ndemand, or inquiry having a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to\nemployees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other\nallegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the\nCompany from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company's technology. The terms of\nthese indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement.\nIn addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers of the Company, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct\nof the individual.\nThe maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements. Noliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2024 and June 30,\n2025.\n23\nTable of Contents\nInsurance Collateral\nThe Company is required to maintain $ 692million in collateral in connection with certain insurance policies, which\ncan be held in a combination of cash, surety bonds, and letters of credit.

Loans under the revolving credit\nfacility bear interest at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted\nterm Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR\n(based on an interest period of one, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also\nobligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees,\nan upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee of 0.10%. The Company's obligations under the revolving credit\nfacility are guaranteed by certain of its domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the\ncredit agreement. The credit agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants\nthat restrict the Company's ability and its subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary\nindebtedness, grant liens, declare cash dividends or make certain other distributions, repurchase stock, merge or\nconsolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken\nas a whole, make investments and loans, and engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Company must also\nmaintain compliance with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined in accordance with the\nterms of the credit agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit\nagreement. As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, norevolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\nIn addition to the letters of credit maintained in connection with the insurance collateral requirement, the\nCompany also maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, the Company had $ 141million and $ 78million of issued letters of credit\noutstanding, respectively, of which $ 112million and $ 42million, respectively, were issued from the revolving\ncredit and guaranty agreement.\nDeliveroo Transaction\nOn May 6, 2025, the Company issued an announcement (the “Rule 2.7 Announcement”) pursuant to Rule 2.7 of the UK\nCity Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the \"Code\"), disclosing that the board of directors of the Company and the\nboard of directors of Deliveroo plc, a company incorporated in England and Wales (“Deliveroo”), had reached\nagreement on the terms of a recommended final cash offer by the Company for the entire issued and to be issued\nshare capital of Deliveroo (the \"Deliveroo Transaction\"). Deliveroo has built one of the leading local commerce\nplatforms across its key geographies, primarily in Europe and the Middle East, all complementary to the Company’s\ncurrent footprint. The proposed purchase price is 180 pence per Deliveroo share in cash, which equates to an equity\nvalue of approximately £ 2.8billion. On June 16, 2025, Deliveroo shareholders approved the Deliveroo Transaction.\nThe transaction is expected to close during the fourth quarter of 2025, subject to certain regulatory approvals and\nother customary closing conditions.\nEscrow Agreement\nIn connection with the Deliveroo Transaction and prior to the Rule 2.7 Announcement, the Company, JPMorgan Chase\nBank, N.A., as escrow agent (the “Escrow Agent”), and J.P. Morgan Securities plc entered into an Escrow Agreement\n(the “Escrow Agreement”). Pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Company deposited in escrow an amount in cash with\nthe Escrow Agent in order to partially fund the cash consideration payable by the Company in connection with the\nDeliveroo Transaction and to satisfy certain requirements pursuant to the Code to evidence certainty of funding for\nthe Deliveroo Transaction (such requirements, the \"Cash Confirmation Requirements\"), which may be converted from\nUnited States Dollars into Pounds Sterling (“GBP”) pursuant to the Deal-Contingent Forward (as defined below)\nentered into by the Company. Cash held in escrow under the Escrow Agreement is recorded as restricted cash on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 2.5billion as of June 30, 2025, inclusive of the Additional\nCash Deposit (as defined below).\nBridge Term Loan Credit and Guaranty Agreement\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn connection with the Deliveroo Transaction, the Company entered into a Bridge Term Loan Credit and Guaranty\nAgreement (the “Bridge Credit Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. on May 6, 2025 to provide the Company\ncertain borrowings in an aggregate amount of up to $ 2.85billion, consisting of (i) $ 1.50billion of tranche A\ncommitments (the \"Tranche A Commitments\") and (ii) $ 1.35billion of tranche B commitments (the \"Tranche B\nCommitments\"). To the extent any borrowings were made under the Bridge Credit Agreement, such loans would mature\n364days after the closing date of the Deliveroo Transaction and would bear interest, at the Company’s option, at a\nper annum rate equal to (i) the base rate or (ii) an adjusted SOFR, in each case, plus a specified spread\ndetermined based on the Company’s senior, unsecured debt ratings. The Company was also obligated under the Bridge\nCredit Agreement to pay customary administration fees, syndication fees, commitment fees, ticking fees, and\nduration fees for a credit facility of this size and type. As of June 30, 2025, no loans were outstanding under the\nBridge Credit Agreement.\nPursuant to the terms of the Bridge Credit Agreement and effective as of June 10, 2025, the Tranche A Commitments\nwere automatically reduced in full and terminated. Concurrently with the termination of the Tranche A Commitments,\nthe Company deposited an additional $ 1.5billion of cash in escrow under the Escrow Agreement in order to maintain\nsatisfaction of the Cash Confirmation Requirements (the \"Additional Cash Deposit\").\nSubsequent to June 30, 2025, the Company voluntarily reduced in full and terminated the Tranche B Commitments and\nthe Bridge Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms. See Note 15 - \"Subsequent Events\" for\nfurther information.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company records sales and indirect tax liabilities as they become probable and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed\nconsolidated balance sheets. The Company is under audit by various state, local, and foreign tax authorities with\nregard to sales and indirect tax matters. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may\ndiffer from the amounts accrued.\n10. Common Stock\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2025, the Company announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of\nshares of its Class A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $ 5.0billion, which is inclusive of the\nremaining share repurchase authority of $ 876million under the share repurchase program that was previously\nannounced by the Company in February 2024. During the six months ended June 30, 2025, the Company did not\nrepurchase any shares of its Class A common stock under the share repurchase program.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company granted restricted stock to certain continuing employees in connection with the acquisition of Wolt\nEnterprises Oy (\"Wolt\") on May 31, 2022. Vesting of this stock is dependent on the respective employee’s continued\nemployment at the Company during the requisite service period, which is generally up to four yearsfrom the issuance\ndate. The fair value of the restricted stock issued to employees that is subject to post-acquisition employment is\nrecorded as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe activities for the restricted stock issued to employees was as follows (in thousands, except per share data):\nWeighted-\nNumber of       Average\nUnvested restricted stock as of December       Shares       Grant Date\n31, 2024                                           92       Fair Value Per Share\nGranted                                             —    $  —\nVested                                              —    $  —\nForfeited                                           —    $  —\nUnvested restricted stock as of June 30,           92\n2025\n25\nTable of Contents\nStock Award Activities\nA summary of stock option activity under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, 2020 Equity Incentive Plan, and 2022\nInducement Equity Incentive Plan was as follows (in millions, except share amounts which are reflected in\nthousands, and per share data):\nWeighted-\nOptions Outstanding                          Average\nShares             Weighted-    Remaining\nsubject to               Average    Contractual             Aggregate\nOptions              Exercise    Term                    Intrinsic\nOutstanding       Price Per Share    (in years)                  Value\nBalance as of December 31,                     4,516    $             5.72                 3.18    $        732\n2024\nGranted                                            —    $                —\nExercised                                     -1,191    $             4.17                         $        220\nCancelled and forfeited                            —    $                —\nBalance as of June 30, 2025                    3,325    $             6.27                 2.82    $        799\nExercisable as of June 30,                     3,204    $             6.35                 2.87    $        770\n2025\nVested and expected to vest\nas of June                                     3,325    $             6.27                 2.82    $        799\n30, 2025\nThe aggregate intrinsic value disclosed in the above table is based on the difference between the exercise price of\nthe stock option and the closing stock price of the Company's Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Market as of\nthe respective period-end dates.

The CEO Performance Award vests upon the\nsatisfaction of a service condition and achievement of certain stock price goals. During the six months ended June\n30, 2025, the first tranche of the CEO Performance Award, representing 518,950shares, vested upon achievement of\nthe first stock price target of $ 187.60, measured over a consecutive 180-day period. Settlement of these vested\nshares is expected to be on the next company vesting date. As of June 30, 2025, there was noremaining unrecognized\nstock-based compensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award.\nAs of June 30, 2025, there was $ 2.2billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to unvested\nrestricted stock and RSUs. The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average period\nof 2.37years.\n11. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate,\nadjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate\nof the annual effective tax rate and, if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a\ncumulative adjustment to tax expense or benefit in the period. The primary difference between the effective tax\nrate and the federal statutory tax rate is due to the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets in\ncertain jurisdictions.\nThe Company recorded $ 1million of provision for income taxes and $ 13million of benefit from income taxes for the\nthree months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, respectively. The Company recorded $ 8million of provision for income\ntaxes and $ 7million of benefit from incomes taxes for the six months ended June 30, 2024 and 2025, respectively.\nThe provision for income taxes for 2024 was primarily attributable to pre-tax book income in the U.S. resulting in\nfederal and state income taxes. The benefit from income taxes for 2025 was primarily attributable to a one-time tax\nbenefit from the release of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance in connection with the acquisitions that\noccurred during the year, offset by federal and state income taxes resulting from pre-tax book income in the U.S.\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance\nif it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. The\nCompany evaluates and weighs all available evidence, both positive and negative, including its historic operating\nresults, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, as well as projected future taxable income. Changes\nin earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause the Company to adjust the\nvaluation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could materially impact the income tax expense in the period the\nCompany determines that these factors have changed. As of June 30, 2025, the Company maintains a full valuation\nallowance on its net deferred tax assets except for certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company is subject to income tax audits in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. The Company recorded liabilities\nrelated to uncertain tax positions and believes that the Company has provided adequate reserves for income tax\nuncertainties in all open tax years. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax years in\nwhich the\n27\nTable of Contents\nattribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign tax authorities to\nthe extent utilized in a future period.\n12. Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to DoorDash, Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders using the two-\nclass method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the\nliquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than\nvoting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net\nincome and losses. The computation of diluted net income per share of Class A common stock for the three and six\nmonths ended June 30, 2025 does not assume the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock because\nincluding such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders during the periods presented. RSUs that have vested but not yet settled are\nincluded in the denominator in calculating basic and diluted net income (loss) per share ( in millions, except\nshare amounts which are reflected in thousands, and per share data):\nThree                                                  Six\nMonths                                               Months\nEnded                                                Ended\nJune                                                 June\n30,                                                  30,\n2024                      2025                       2024                       2025\nClass        Class        Class        Class       Class A        Class       Class A        Class\nA            B            A            B                          B                          B\nBasic\nnet\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nNume…\nNet\ninco…\n(los…\nincl…         -148          -10          267           17          -171          -12           448           28\nrede…\nnon-…\ninte…\nLess:\nNet\nloss\nattr…           -1            —           -1            —            -3            —            -2            —\nto\nrede…\nnon-…\ninte…\nNet\ninco…\n(los…\nattr…\nto            -147          -10          268           17          -168          -12           450           28\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nDeno…\nWeig…\nnumb…\nof\nshar…\nouts…\nused\nto\ncomp…\nbasic\nnet         383,3…       27,166       400,1…       25,005       380,778       27,204       398,041       25,237\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nBasic\nnet\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare    $   -0.38    $   -0.38    $    0.67    $    0.67    $    -0.44    $   -0.44    $     1.13    $    1.13\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nThree                                                  Six\nMonths                                               Months\nEnded                                                Ended\nJune                                                 June\n30,                                                  30,\n2024                      2025                       2024                       2025\nClass        Class        Class        Class       Class A        Class       Class A        Class\nA            B            A            B                          B                          B\nDilu…\nnet\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nNume…\nNet\ninco…\n(los…\nattr…\nto            -147          -10          268           17          -168          -12           450           28\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nDeno…\nWeig…\nnumb…\nof\nshar…\nouts…\nused\nto\ncomp…\nbasic\nnet         383,3…       27,166       400,1…       25,005       380,778       27,204       398,041       25,237\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nWeig…\neffe…\nof               —            —       13,264            —             —            —        13,702            —\npote…\ndilu…\nsecu…\nWeig…\nnumb…\nof\nshar…\nouts…\nused\nto\ncomp…\ndilu…\nnet         383,3…       27,166       413,3…       25,005       380,778       27,204       411,743       25,237\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nDilu…\nnet\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare    $   -0.38    $   -0.38    $    0.65    $    0.65    $    -0.44    $   -0.44    $     1.09    $    1.09\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\n28\nTable of Contents\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet income (loss) per share because including such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect, or the issuance of\nsuch shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied at the end of the\nrespective periods (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended June 30,              Six Months Ended June 30,\n2024      2025                         2024      2025\nStock options to purchase                                6,430         —                        6,430         —\ncommon stock\nUnvested restricted stock and\nrestricted                                              35,585    10,102                       35,585    10,345\nstock units\nEscrow shares                                               72        72                           72        72\nConvertible notes                                            —     3,312                            —     1,665\nWarrants related to the\nissuance of                                                  —     3,312                            —     1,665\nconvertible notes\nTotal                                                   42,087    16,798                       42,087    13,747\n13.

Derivative\nIn connection with the proposed acquisition of Deliveroo, the Company entered into a deal-contingent foreign\nexchange forward transaction with Bank of America, N.A. (the \"Deal-Contingent Forward\") on May 6, 2025 to manage\nthe risk of variability in foreign exchange rates related to the GBP-denominated purchase price. The Deal-\nContingent Forward has a notional amount of approximately £ 2.8billion and is deliverable, with a variable forward\nrate, and settlement is contingent upon the successful closing of the transaction. Although the Deal-Contingent\nForward is an effective economic hedge, it does not qualify for hedge accounting.\nThe fair value of the Deal-Contingent Forward at June 30, 2025 was $ 69million, recorded in Prepaid expenses and\nother current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and an unrealized gain of $ 69million was\nrecognized\n29\nTable of Contents\nduring the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, reported in other income (expense), net in the condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nThe Deal-Contingent Forward is classified as a Level 3 instrument within the fair value hierarchy. See Note 6 -\n\"Fair Value Measurements\" for further information on the fair value measurement.\n15. Subsequent Events\nOn July 15, 2025, the Company voluntarily reduced in full and terminated the Tranche B Commitments under the Bridge\nCredit Agreement. After giving effect to such reduction, no commitments remained outstanding under the Bridge\nCredit Agreement and the Bridge Credit Agreement was terminated in accordance with its terms. Concurrently with the\ntermination of the Tranche B Commitments, the Company deposited an additional $ 1.32billion of cash in escrow under\nthe Escrow Agreement in order to maintain satisfaction of the Cash Confirmation Requirements.\n30\nTable of Contents",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are\nbased on current plans, expectations, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may\ndiffer materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and\nother sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for any period in the future.\nOverview\nDoorDash, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. Our mission is to grow\nand empower local economies. We aim to do this by providing services that reduce friction in local commerce and\nhelp merchants better connect with consumers in their communities.\nOur primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace and the Wolt Marketplace (our \"Marketplaces\"), and our\nCommerce Platform. Our Marketplaces operate in over 30 countries across the globe and provide an integrated suite\nof services that help merchants establish an online presence, connect with consumers in their communities, and\nsolve mission-critical challenges, such as customer acquisition, demand generation, order fulfillment,\nmerchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We also offer advertising as a value-added service through\nour Marketplaces to help merchants and consumer packaged goods companies increase consumer engagement and drive\nincremental revenue.\nOur Marketplaces compete for consumers based primarily on the selection, convenience, quality, affordability, and\nservice we provide. Our Marketplaces also offer our consumer membership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, which aim to\nlower transactional friction by reducing the delivery and service fees we charge, while providing additional\nmembership benefits.\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer our Commerce Platform, which is a suite of services that help merchants\ngrow, run, and operate their businesses on their own channels. DoorDash Drive On-Demand and Wolt Drive (together,\n\"Drive\") are white-label delivery fulfillment services that generate the majority of revenue within our Commerce\nPlatform.

We define Total Orders as all orders completed through our Marketplaces and Commerce Platform over\nthe period of measurement.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Total Orders increased to 761 million, or 20% growth compared to the same quarter of\n2024. The increase in Total Orders was driven primarily by growth in consumers and growth in average consumer\nengagement.\nMarketplace GOV. We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplaces,\nincluding taxes, tips 2 , and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass and\nWolt+. Marketplace GOV does not include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants,\nfor orders fulfilled through our Commerce Platform.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Marketplace GOV increased to $24.2 billion, or 23% growth compared to the same\nquarter of 2024, driven primarily by growth in Total Orders.\nNet Revenue Margin . We define Net Revenue Margin as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Net Revenue Margin increased to 13.5% from 13.3% in the same quarter of 2024,\nprimarily due to improved logistics efficiency, increasing contribution from advertising revenue, and a reduction\nin credits and refunds as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. These factors were partially offset by a shift in volume\nto categories with lower Net Revenue Margins.\nContribution Profit. We define Contribution Profit as our gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus (i)\ndepreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain\npayroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, (iii) allocated overhead included\nin cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off related to restructuring. Gross\nprofit is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii)\ndepreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue.\n2 Dashers receive 100% of tips\n32\nTable of Contents\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit is\na useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct\nexpenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Contribution Profit increased to $1.1 billion, compared to $825 million in the same\nquarter of 2024, driven primarily by growth in revenue, partially offset by increases in cost of revenue and sales\nand marketing expenses.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders,\nadjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and exclude (i) certain\nlegal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment,\n(iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs),\n(iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory write-off related to restructuring, (vii)\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest income, net, (ix) other (income) expense, net, (x)\nstock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage\nin our business.\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $655 million from $430 million in the same quarter of\n2024, driven primarily by growth in Contribution Profit, partially offset by increases in adjusted research and\ndevelopment expense and adjusted general and administrative expense.\nFree Cash Flow. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and\nequipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nIn the second quarter of 2025 , we generated net cash provided by operating activities of $504 million and Free\nCash Flow of $355 million, down from $530 million and $451 million, respectively in the same quarter of 2024. Among\nother factors, Free Cash Flow in the second quarter of 2025 was negatively impacted by timing of working capital,\nwhich we expect to act as a benefit to Free Cash Flow in the second half of 2025.\n33\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our historical condensed consolidated statements of operations data:\nThree Months Ended June

Foreign jurisdictions\nhave different statutory tax rates than those in the U.S. Additionally, certain of our foreign earnings may also be\ntaxable in the U.S.\nAccordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes\nin our stock price, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit\ndevelopments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and\nlosses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations\nrelated to tax, including changes to the global tax framework,\n38\nTable of Contents\ncompetition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or\nlosses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible\nexpenses varies depending on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of any particular item\nis greater when the amount of our pre-tax income or loss is smaller.\nWe have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets in the U.S. and Finland. We expect to maintain these\nvaluation allowances until it becomes more-likely-than-not that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be\nrealized by way of expected future taxable income in the U.S. and Finland.\n(in millions,           Three Months                                 Six Months Ended\nexcept                Ended June 30,                                         June 30,\npercentages)                    2024       2025    % Change                      2024       2025    % Change\nProvision for\n(benefit from)    $                1    $   -13              *    $                 8    $    -7              *\nincome\ntaxes\n*Percentage not meaningful\nThe benefit from income taxes for the second quarter of 2025 was primarily attributable to a one-time tax benefit\nfrom the release of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance in connection with the acquisitions that occurred\nduring the quarter, offset by federal and state income taxes resulting from pre-tax book income in the U.S. The\nprovision for income taxes for the same quarter of 2024 was primarily attributable to pre-tax book income in the\nU.S. resulting in federal and state income taxes.\nThe benefit from income taxes for the first six months of 2025 was primarily attributable to a one-time tax benefit\nfrom the release of a portion of the U.S. valuation allowance in connection with the acquisitions that occurred\nduring the year, offset by federal and state income taxes resulting from pre-tax book income in the U.S. The\nprovision for income taxes for the first six months of 2024 was primarily attributable to pre-tax book income in\nthe U.S. resulting in federal and state income taxes.\nGiven our current earnings and anticipated future earnings, we believe that there is a reasonable possibility that\nsufficient positive evidence may become available in a future period to reach a conclusion that the U.S. valuation\nallowance will no longer be needed. Release of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of U.S.\nfederal and state deferred tax assets and a corresponding decrease to income tax expense in the period the release\nis recorded. The exact timing and amount of any potential valuation allowance release are subject to change on the\nbasis of our level of sustained U.S. profitability, as well as the amount of our tax deductible stock-based\ncompensation, which is dependent upon our publicly traded share price, and macroeconomic conditions, among other\nfactors.\nOn July 4, 2025, the U.S. enacted tax reform legislation through the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Included in this\nlegislation are provisions that allow for the immediate expensing of domestic U.S. research and development\nexpenses, immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures, and other changes to the U.S. taxation of profits\nderived from foreign operations. We will continue to evaluate the impact that this new legislation has on the\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\nFor additional information, see Note 11 - \"Income Taxes\" included in Part I, Item 1, \"Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements\" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense,\nadjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit,\nAdjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall\nassessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to\nevaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our\nbusiness and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to\ninvestors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance\nand future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their\nfinancial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors\nin seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these\nnon-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of\nour business over multiple periods and with other companies in our industry.\n39\nTable of Contents\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense,\nadjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit,\nContribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow should be\nconsidered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free\nCash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial\nmeasure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and\ndevelopment expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin,\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with their\nrespective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, allocated overhead, and inventory write-off related to\nrestructuring.

As of December 31, 2024 and June 30, 2025, no\nrevolving loans were outstanding and $112 million and $42 million of letters of credit were issued under our\nrevolving credit facility, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of June 30, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of\n$5.7 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $3.9 billion, short-term marketable securities of\n$1.1 billion, and long-term marketable securities of $725 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $322 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks, as well as institutional money market funds and certificates of deposit. Marketable\nsecurities consisted of certificates of deposit, commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency\nsecurities, U.S. Treasury securities, and mutual funds.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $4.8\nbillion as of June 30, 2025. We have historically funded our operations from cash from operations as well as the\nissuance of equity securities, including in our initial public offering in December 2020. We have also completed\ndebt financings, such as our recent issuance of $2.75 billion aggregate principal amount of 0% Convertible Senior\nNotes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”) in May 2025. We intend to use the net proceeds from the 2030 Notes for general\ncorporate purposes. For additional information regarding the 2030 Notes, see Note 8 - \"Convertible Notes, Net\"\nincluded in Part I, Item 1, \"Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q.\nTo execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and\ngenerate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital\nresources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with the available\nborrowings under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital\nexpenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond.\nIn February 2025, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock in an aggregate amount of up to $5.0 billion, which is inclusive of the remaining share\nrepurchase authority of $876 million under the share repurchase program that we previously announced in February\n2024. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated\ntransactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market\nrepurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We\nhave entered into, and may, from time to time, enter into, Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our Class\nA common stock under this authorization. We may or may not repurchase any portion of the total authorized amount,\nand the timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general\nbusiness and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities. As of June 30, 2025, $5.0 billion\nremained available under the repurchase authorization.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, the expansion\nof sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives, and the occurrence of certain conditions triggering the 2030 Notes' conversion feature, which will be\nrequired to be settled partially or entirely in cash, or the repurchase of some or all of the 2030 Notes. Further,\nwe have entered into pending, and may in the future enter into additional, arrangements to acquire or invest in\nbusinesses, products, services, and technologies. For example, we recently announced a formal offer to acquire\nDeliveroo plc for 180 pence per share in a recommended final all cash transaction (the \"Deliveroo Transaction\") and\nrecently closed our acquisition of SevenRooms Inc. in an all-cash\n44\nTable of Contents\ntransaction. In connection with the Deliveroo Transaction, we entered into (i) a Bridge Term Loan Credit and\nGuaranty Agreement (the “Bridge Credit Agreement”) to, among other things, provide a source of financing to\npartially fund the cash consideration payable by us in the Deliveroo Transaction; and (ii) an Escrow Agreement (the\n“Escrow Agreement”), pursuant to which, we deposited in escrow certain cash amounts to partially fund the cash\nconsideration payable by us in the Deliveroo Transaction. For additional information regarding the Deliveroo\nTransaction, the Bridge Credit Agreement, including the subsequent termination of the Bridge Credit Agreement, and\nthe Escrow Agreement, see Note 9 - \"Commitments and Contingencies\" included in Part I, Item 1, \"Notes to Condensed\nConsolidated Financial Statements\" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In addition, the 2030 Notes will mature\non May 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed or converted. Before November 15, 2029, noteholders will have\nthe right to convert the 2030 Notes only upon the occurrence of certain events. From and after November 15, 2029,\nnoteholders may convert their 2030 Notes at any time at their election until the close of business on the second\nscheduled trading day immediately before the maturity date. We will have the right to elect to settle conversions\neither in cash or in a combination of cash and shares of our Class A common stock, provided that, at least the\nprincipal amount of the 2030 Notes being converted will be paid in cash, which could adversely affect our\nliquidity. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing\nis required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are\nunable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nSix Months Ended June 30,\n(in millions)                                                      2024         2025\nNet cash provided by operating             $                      1,083    $   1,139\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                              -219       -1,101\nNet cash provided by financing                                        2        2,378\nactivities\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                               -18           63\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents,    $                        848    $   2,479\nand restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2025. This consisted of net\nincome including redeemable non-controlling interests of $476 million, adjusted for non-cash stock-based\ncompensation expense of $517 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $311 million, non-cash\nreduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $53 million, non-\ncash office lease impairment expenses of $7 million, and other net non-cash expenses of $61 million, offset by a\n$69 million change in fair value of our deal-contingent forward contract, as well as $217 million net outflows from\nchanges in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by changes in other assets and accounts receivable,\nnet, and payments for operating lease liabilities, partially offset by changes in funds held at payment processors.\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2024. This consisted of a net\nloss including redeemable non-controlling interests of $183 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation\nexpense of $554 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $282 million, non-cash reduction of\noperating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $52 million, non-cash office\nlease impairment expenses of $83 million, and other net non-cash expenses of $41 million, as well as $254 million\nnet inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in accrued liabilities\nand other current liabilities.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $1.1 billion for the first six months of 2025, which consisted of cash paid\nfor acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $1.2 billion, purchases of marketable securities of $725 million,\npurchases of property and equipment of $140 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website development\ncosts of $150 million, partially offset by proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities of $1.1\nbillion.\nCash used in investing activities was $219 million for the first six months of 2024, which primarily consisted of\npurchases of marketable securities of $969 million, purchases of property and equipment of $40 million, and cash\noutflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $105 million, partially offset by proceeds from\nmaturities and sales of marketable securities of $903 million.\n45\nTable of Contents\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by financing activities was $2.4 billion for the first six months of 2025, which primarily consisted\nof proceeds form issuance of convertible notes of $2.7 billion, proceeds from issuance of warrants of $341 million,\npartially offset by purchase of convertible note hedges of $680 million.\nCash provided by financing activities was $2 million for the first six months of 2024, which consisted of proceeds\nfrom exercise of stock options of $3 million and other financing activities of $6 million, partially offset by\nrepurchases of our Class A common stock of $7 million.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Quarterly\nReport on Form 10-Q are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of condensed consolidated financial\nstatements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect\nthe reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements,\nas well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on\nhistorical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances.\nActual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our\nestimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of\noperations, and cash flows could be affected.\nThere have been no material changes to our critical accounting estimates as described in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024.",

          "content": "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax\nreported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of June 30, 2025, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest\nrates would not have materially affected our condensed consolidated financial statements. We currently do not hedge\nthese interest rate exposures.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes\nother than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these\nsecurities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the\nearly stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies, and we\nbelieve that determining the impact of market sensitivities on these investments is not practicable.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $41 million as of June 30, 2025.\nAdjustments or impairments are recorded in other income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\n46\nTable of Contents\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel, and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported\nincome and loss from our international businesses included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nA continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our\ninternational businesses included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income or loss as a result of\ntransaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nForeign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the three and six months ended June 30, 2025. Based on our\nforeign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities as of June 30, 2025, we estimated that a 10% change\nin exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\nThe purchase price of the Deliveroo Transaction is denominated in GBP. To manage the risk of variability in foreign\nexchange rates related to the purchase price, we entered into the Deal-Contingent Forward on May 6, 2025, which is\ndiscussed in Note 14 - \"Derivative\" included in Part I, Item 1, \"Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial\nStatements\" of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. The Deal-Contingent Forward has a notional amount of\napproximately £2.8 billion and is deliverable, with a variable forward rate, consisting of (i) a base rate ranging\nfrom 1.33950 to 1.34084, plus (ii) a premium rate ranging from 0.00705 to 0.01509, depending on the expected dates\nof settlement and closing, respectively. Settlement of the Deal-Contingent Forward is contingent upon the\nsuccessful closing of the Deliveroo Transaction. Although the Deal-Contingent Forward is an effective economic\nhedge, it does not qualify for hedge accounting. The fair value of the Deal-Contingent Forward at June 30, 2025 was\n$69 million, recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the condensed consolidated balance sheets and\nan unrealized gain of $69 million was recognized during the three and six months ended June 30, 2025, reported in\nother income (expense), net in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our non-U.S.\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our non-U.S. subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) which is part of stockholders’ equity.",

Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a\nreasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended June 30, 2025 that\nhave materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\n47\nTable of Contents\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n48\nTable of Contents",

Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third parties (individually or as class\nactions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. When\nwe determine that we have meritorious defenses to any claims asserted, we defend ourselves vigorously; however, we\nalso consider settlement of disputes when, in management’s judgment, it is in the best interests of both DoorDash\nand its shareholders to do so. For some matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of\nthe amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that\ncould potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal\nProceedings, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded or non-monetary damages.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought under California\nLabor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and\nother matters challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. Various other\nDashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our\nplatform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual Dashers,\nwith many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our independent\ncontractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney\nfiled an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified\nCalifornia Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and\nthe California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages\nand a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent\ncontractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is\nnot estimable given the status of the case.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, competition laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws, and\nother laws. In addition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid\nto Dashers and our former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to\ncontinue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence\n49\nTable of Contents\nfrom other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property or\nasserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves\nvigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies\nconcerning our business practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models and\npay practices, compliance with consumer protection laws, privacy, cybersecurity, tax issues, unemployment\ninsurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the\nEmployment Development Department of the State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January\n2023, the CA EDD issued a negative assessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious\ndefenses to the CA EDD’s assessment, and intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. However, the ultimate\nresolution of the audit is uncertain and, accordingly, we have recorded an accrual for this matter within accrued\nexpenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2025. We are\ncurrently the subject of government investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries in other jurisdictions as well,\nand we may in the future settle, or record accruals with respect to, such matters. Further, the results of\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as\nsuch, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, demand, or inquiry having a material impact on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit,\nor inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome,\nthese matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending\nagainst, such matters, and the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or\nother incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have\nmeritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no\npending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\nhowever, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n50\nTable of Contents",

If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and\nprospects could be adversely affected.

These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nconsistently maintain or increase profitability in the future;\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to adequately\nmaintain their service levels or materially increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business\ncould be adversely affected;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, technology\ninfrastructure, or platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful;\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate, it could have an adverse effect that is material to our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations;\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result;\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations;\n51\nTable of Contents\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (our \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, which will\nlimit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval; and\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services, expanded\ninto new categories, changed our pricing methodologies, and entered new geographies. This limited operating history\nand our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may\nencounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\nsuccessfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nwith respect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline and food costs;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\nhire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations;\neffectively adapt to and manage the regulatory environment and new laws related to our business; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have relatively limited\nhistorical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of\noperations may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more\npredictable market. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations\ncould differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nconsistently maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nWhile we achieved net income in the three and six months ended June 30, 2025 and in the year ended December 31,\n2024, we incurred net losses in each preceding year since our founding. We incurred a net loss of $180 million in\nthe six months ended June 30, 2024, and as of June 30, 2025, we had an accumulated deficit of $4.8 billion. We\nexpect our costs will increase over time and we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our\nbusiness. To the extent that we are unable to earn sufficient revenue to offset such costs, we may incur losses in\ncertain future periods. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources\non developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform\nfeatures and services, acquiring and\n52\nTable of Contents\nintegrating technologies and businesses, expanding into new markets and categories, and increasing our sales and\nmarketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in sufficient increased\nrevenue or growth in our business to offset such costs. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep\npace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from achieving, maintaining, or increasing\nprofitability on a consistent basis, which could also negatively impact our cash flow. If we are unable to\nsuccessfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of June 30, 2025, we had $2.2\nbillion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards.\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nOur past revenue growth rate, growth in demand for our offerings, and financial performance may not be indicative\nof our future performance. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or\nannual periods as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business metrics\ngrowth in future periods.\nIn particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the\nshort term and decline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market\nadoption. We may also experience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform,\ninsufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing\ncompetition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, or\nincreasing regulatory costs. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our\nbusiness, including through acquisitions, which may not result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost\nof such investments. If our growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of\nour Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway, Delivery Hero, and\nother local incumbents. We also compete with merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online\nordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services,\nconvenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide merchant delivery services.\nIn addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and\npaper menus that merchants distribute to consumers. As we continue to expand to additional verticals, we may\ncompete or come in closer competition with additional businesses with substantial resources, users, and brand\npower, including large e-commerce companies, large retailers, large grocery store chains and other large delivery\nservice providers.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, market-specific knowledge, established relationships with local merchants and suppliers,\nlarger existing user bases, more successful marketing capabilities, established geographic footprints and\ninfrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. For example, with\ngrocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains that have strong bargaining power, established\nrelationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater financial resources and product development\ncapabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies\nand changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less attractive or obsolete.\nIf certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic market, if merchants choose to\nengage exclusively with our competitors, or if merchants decide to not partner with us at all, we may lack a\nsufficient variety and supply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our\noffering would become less appealing to consumers. Our competitors have in the past, and may in the future, also\nmake acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic relationships among themselves or with others,\nincluding by integrating their services or membership products with the offerings of another company that provides\nexpanded distribution. Our competitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and performance\ncharacteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than ours. Such efforts may lead us to lose\nconsumers or access to new consumers or require us to increase our marketing or promotional expenses or otherwise\nincrease investment in our service in order to maintain our position with existing and new consumers.\n53\nTable of Contents\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and may offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and\nconsumer fees, greater incentives for merchants joining their platforms and independent contractors who provide\ndelivery services, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay\nmodels, any of which may be more attractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures have led us, and\nmay lead us in the future, to change our commission rates and fees or change our incentives, discounts, and\npromotions to remain competitive. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will likely continue to negatively\naffect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the\nmarkets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we\nanticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the\nother competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees,\nor increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Local\non-demand delivery services for food and the other areas in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot guarantee\nthat they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to maintain or increase profitability.\nFurther, merchants could determine that it is in their best interests to develop their own platforms to offer\nonline pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift based on\ncost, quality, and selection and could use more than one local commerce platform; independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings; and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain\nof our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than\nours, which would make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate.\nAs a result of the reasons described above, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing\nmerchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers,\nor are forced to reduce our commission rate or make pricing or other concessions as a result of increased\ncompetition, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to cost-effectively grow our\nplatform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in new\nmarkets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers attracts\nmore merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has grown in\nthe past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our\nnational brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to incur\nsubstantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to\nacquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may\ninvest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved in the\nexpected timeframe or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire\nwill ultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by\nproviding us at least 7 or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any exclusivity.\nIn the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection available on our\nlocal commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our relationships with some of\nour constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other constituencies. For example, the\nincreased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how compelling these offerings are to\nconsumers, depends in part on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership products. Additionally,\nmany of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and\nother reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to\n54\nTable of Contents\nsuch consumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our membership\nproducts, through prompts and notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other offerings.\nHowever, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our platform\nafter they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our consumers\nto regular paying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform, demand for our\nfull-price or paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or\ndecline.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures, and to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the\nability to decline offers or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity\narrangements with Dashers. In addition, we may modify our logistics models from time to time and Dashers may or may\nnot find such modifications useful or favorable. If we do not continue to provide Dashers with accessibility to and\nflexibility on our platform and compelling opportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers, retain\nexisting Dashers, or increase their use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or\nwork stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. Relatedly, if merchants and/or consumers\nchoose to use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the\nperceived utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain\nDashers, we regularly invest in removing friction from the dashing process, offer monetary incentives and\nperquisites, including access to programs that provide cashback rewards on certain purchases, and provide\nopportunities to quickly access Dasher earnings. We also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing\nDashers and potential Dashers; however, these incentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to\nincrease the use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have unintended adverse consequences, including\nnegative press, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our brand and reputation.\nChanges in certain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment laws, or laws that require\nus to make changes to our platform that decrease the accessibility, including removing access to our platform, or\nflexibility provided to Dashers in certain jurisdictions, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which\nmay result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors\noutside of our control may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our platform\nby Dashers. If we fail to attract Dashers, retain existing Dashers on favorable terms, or maintain or increase the\nuse of our platform by existing Dashers, we may not be able to meet the demands of merchants and consumers and our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to adequately\nmaintain their service levels or materially increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these\nmerchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods, meeting our requirements and\nstandards, or price their goods on our platform at unreasonable rates, our reputation and brand could be damaged.\nAn increase in merchant operating costs, whether due to inflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our\nplatform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect\nour revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. Further, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\n55\nTable of Contents\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\nthe impact of acquired technologies and businesses and our ability to successfully integrate such acquired\ntechnologies and businesses;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nthe mix among various aspects of our business, including our Marketplaces and Commerce Platform, our U.S. and\nnon-U.S. operations, our restaurant and non-restaurant categories, and contributions to our overall business by new\nproducts and services, such as our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and our advertising products;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery in any particular region or worldwide;\nthe impact of weather and seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college\ncampuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform, regulations governing the rates that we pay Dashers that\nutilize our platform and other conditions of their work, and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge\nto merchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of outbreaks of contagious disease and the response of governments and private industry;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, technology\ninfrastructure, or platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cybersecurity attacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, other\nnatural disasters,\n56\nTable of Contents\npower losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist\nattacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins,\nsabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become increasingly\ndifficult and expensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of our\nplatform, especially during peak usage times, as our operations grow and the usage of our platform increases. Some\nof our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all\neventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result\nfrom interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions that\ninterrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These events have\nresulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of revenue and may\nharm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to consumers on our\nplatform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event, including for orders\nthat are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may voluntarily provide similar\ncredits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse from us for their losses and such\nclaims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, we may not be\nable to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged\ninterruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform\ncould adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets\nand arrangements that complement our business. We have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to\nevaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent markets and there is no assurance that such acquired\nbusinesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we enter into, will be successfully integrated into our\nbusiness, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits on a timely basis or at all.\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and\nnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and\nadversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\ndifficulties integrating and realizing the anticipated benefits of new business models, lines of business, and\nadjacent technologies from acquisitions into our operations;\ndifficulties integrating the technologies and operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts,\nand personnel of an acquired business;\ndifficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business,\nand difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\ndifficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\nchallenges integrating internal controls, procedures, and policies and accounting, finance, and forecasting\npractices of acquired businesses with our own, especially in the context of international businesses;\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense\nsharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership\ninvestments;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndifficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones,\nlanguages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\ncurrency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with non-U.S. jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\n57\nTable of Contents\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment\nopportunities;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify and/or sufficiently mitigate against the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or\nchallenges of an investment or acquired business, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual\nproperty, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand\nmanagement, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\nthe enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our\nability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions\n(such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the\ncompletion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\nan acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our\nexisting business;\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction,\nwhich may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\nas a result of an acquisition, third parties we work with or the acquired business works with may delay or defer\ncertain business decisions, seek to terminate, change, or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired\nbusiness, or consider working with a competitor instead; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our\nresults of operations, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or\nif the transaction costs are greater than expected.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. Strategic investments\ninherently involve less control by us over the business operations of the investee, thereby potentially increasing\nthe financial, legal, operational, regulatory, or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic\ninvestment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or\nentities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or\ncompetitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders,\nmanagement, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result\nin litigation or regulatory action against us, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to\nsell or transfer, or realize value from our investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and\nregulations. Entry into certain transactions with non-U.S. entities now or in the future may be subject to\ngovernment regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or non-U.S. government\nentities. If a transaction with a non-U.S. entity is subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might\nlimit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term\nbusiness strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments will generate returns for our\nbusiness, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, during the quarter\nended December 31, 2023, we recorded an impairment of $101 million associated with non-marketable equity securities\nthat we acquired in connection with strategic investments.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets,\narrangements, and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such\nacquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful.\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S.\ncountries as part of our growth strategy. We currently operate in over 30 countries across the globe and we\nrecently announced the pending acquisition of Deliveroo, which, if completed, will expand our operations to\nadditional countries. Our operations outside of the United States require significant operating expenses and\nmanagement attention in order to oversee operations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural\nnorms, and customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and\noperations teams. Our international\n58\nTable of Contents\noperations and our plans for investment in non-U.S. jurisdictions subject us to a number of risks and we may not be\nsuccessful in our international operations for a variety of reasons, including:\ndifficulties in recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in non-U.S. countries and maintaining our\ncompany culture across all of our offices;\nincreased difficulty achieving profitability, operating leverage and scale as a result of continued expansion\nacross jurisdictions rather than concentrated growth in fewer jurisdictions;\nan inability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers or an inability to reach agreements with and\nretain third party service providers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local area and culture, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics and difficulty accurately predicting consumer preferences and purchasing habits, which\nmay make our platform less successful;\ndifficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, consumers, and Dashers in non-U.S.\njurisdictions;\ndifficulty complying with varying laws, regulatory standards or other requirements from applicable authorities\nacross jurisdictions, including with respect to labor and employment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export\ncontrol and sanctions, public health, payment processing, transactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\nincreased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue\nrecognition and similar accounting principles;\ndifficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and\ncustoms, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it\nrelates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax laws, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\nunique and varying terms and conditions and cultural norms in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\nvarying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\nforeign currency exchange restrictions or costs;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, which have occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations and differences in available instruments to invest our funds, including the risk profile associated\nwith such investments, and limitations on our ability to repatriate funds.\nChallenges with operating and growing our business internationally increase the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security\nrisks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards,\nincluding with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions, such as\nU.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, the\noperations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Wolt Oy (\"Wolt\"), or Wolt's subsidiaries in jurisdictions that are in\nclose proximity to Russia increase the difficulty in complying with trade and economic sanction regimes related to\nbusiness with Russia.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors, and we may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints, or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, some jurisdictions in which we operate\nhave established minimum earnings standards for certain delivery workers, including Dashers, and other types of\nregulation, and we expect other such measures may be enacted in the future. These minimum earnings standards and\nsimilar regulations have caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers.\nCertain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings.\nSimilarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract and retain new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers at a lower cost than us. There is no assurance that we will not be forced, through\ncompetition, regulation, or otherwise, to reduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we\npay to Dashers that utilize our platform, further reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or increase\nour marketing and other expenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive\npressures. We have launched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, including Dasher\nor consumer loyalty programs, such as our membership products like DashPass and Wolt+, or modify existing pricing\nmethodologies or the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not\nultimately be successful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers and which may result in lower\ncommissions or fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, our consumers’ price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our business model and\npricing methodologies may not be competitive in these locations. As a result, our continued international expansion\nmay require us to change our operations and pricing strategies to adjust to different cultural norms, including\nwith respect to consumer pricing and gratuities.\nOur assessments about optimal pricing strategy may not be accurate and may not enable us to compete in the\ncategories and regions in which we operate effectively. There may also be errors or defects in the technology we\nuse to set our prices, which could result in underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, as the products\nand services on our platform change, we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Any such pricing assumptions,\ntechnological errors or defects in pricing, or changes to our pricing methodology could adversely affect demand for\nour platform, our brand and reputation, and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay models for Dashers.\nOur pay models for Dashers have previously led, and may continue to lead, to negative publicity, lawsuits,\narbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under a former pay model for Dashers in the United\nStates, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little or no tip.\nAlthough this additional pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile, it also\nhad the effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being received by\nDashers. Government authorities have brought claims against us related to a former Dasher pay model and government\nauthorities may bring similar claims in the future against our pay models.\nWe have also launched, and may in the future launch, changes to the rates and fee structures for Dashers that\nutilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers and may result in\nnegative publicity or damage to our reputation. Changes to our pay models have resulted in, and in the future may\nresult in, negative publicity related to perceptions of its complexity, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and\nlack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, any of which may negatively impact our ability to attract\nand retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, we increased the amount we paid to Dashers per order\nwhen we changed our pay model in September 2019, but this also caused less consistency in earnings across\ndeliveries in some cases. In addition, in June 2023, we announced an option for Dashers in most cities to earn a\nguaranteed hourly rate while delivering. We change our Dasher pay models from time to time based on a variety of\nfactors, including as a result of legal and regulatory changes and expansion into new categories and geographies.\nIn particular, new or amended laws and regulations have required, and could in the future require, us to make\nchanges to our Dasher pay models, or make other changes to our platform, that decrease the flexibility provided to\nDashers in certain jurisdictions, which may also impact our ability to cost-effectively attract or retain Dashers.\nOur current Dasher pay models, any changes made in response to new laws and regulations, and any future changes to\nour pay models or our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers, could result in an increase to the\nfees we charge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain consumers, and could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n60\nTable of Contents\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform remain independent contractors, there is a risk\nthat Dashers may be reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law or the laws of other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. As discussed further elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have been involved in\nand continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification in the United States. A\nreclassification of Dashers as employees could require us to revise our pricing methodologies and Dasher pay models\nto account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other internal adjustments to account for any\ntransition of a subset of Dashers to employment positions, which could have an adverse effect that is material to\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. This growth has\nplaced, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial\ninfrastructure.\nWe will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure, including the development of\nappropriate controls, in order to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nSimilarly, our failure to implement and maintain effective cybersecurity systems and measures with respect to our\nplatform as we grow could result in, among other things, breaches, security incidents, theft or fraud, service\ndisruptions, loss of user confidence in our platform, legal claims, regulatory investigations, and damage to our\nreputation or brand, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, services, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our\noperational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large\nnumber of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge\nour ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our\nplatform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand could hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform. Similarly, maintaining and\nenhancing the Wolt reputation and brand will be particularly important for our continued growth in Europe and Asia.\nSuccessfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network\neffects of our platform will depend on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent,\nhigh-quality services and support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use\nthe “DoorDash” and \"Wolt\" marks, our logos, and other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of\nother factors, many of which are outside our control. Our users have a wide variety of options for delivery of\ngoods, including other local commerce platforms and services, and consumer preferences may also change. To expand\nour user base, we must appeal to new users who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or\nother local commerce platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be adversely affected\nby complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize our platform or\nour competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. The effect of negative\npublicity could be exacerbated to the extent dissatisfaction with, or complaints concerning, us are disseminated\nvia social media platforms. Any such expressions of dissatisfaction or complaints, even if ultimately concluded to\nbe unfounded or successfully resolved without direct adverse financial effects, could still harm our brand,\nreputation, and local network effects. Negative perception of our platform or company may result from:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our business model, our platform, services or items provided through\nour platform, including highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines,\nincluding Dasher pay;\n61\nTable of Contents\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\ntraffic accidents caused by, or involving, Dashers or employee couriers or death or serious injury involving a\nDasher or employee courier or any party associated with us;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, in which constituencies of our network become infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient number of offers or otherwise pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or security\nbreaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact the\nreliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform or operations;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, or inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements, including violations of food\ninformation and alcohol delivery age verification regulations;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of merchant, consumer, and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\nperception of any key brands, influencers, or other third parties that we have partnered with or may partner with\nin the future;\nour operations in regions that are or become subject to geopolitical instability, conflict, or economic\nsanctions, and any negative consequences of such operations to us, our merchants, consumers, or Dashers; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nFor example, we have previously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which Dashers were\ncompensated, in particular with respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general food safety\nand quality, and concerns regarding the safety of Dashers, consumers, and merchants using our platform, which has\nadversely affected our reputation and brand from time to time. If we do not successfully develop, protect, and\nenhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network effects of our platform, our business may not grow,\nand we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, subject us\nto claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our reputation, brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, transmission, and other processing of personal data and other\nsensitive and proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and\nproprietary data\n62\nTable of Contents\nrelating to our business, including our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our employees.\nCybersecurity incidents are increasing in severity and sophistication and can originate with external actors or\nwith our employees and contractors, whether acting maliciously or by inadvertently providing access to an external\nparty or having their credentials compromised by an external party. Further, over the past several years, there has\nbeen and continues to be a heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents sponsored by state actors or state-affiliated\nactors. In addition to other vectors, cybersecurity incidents can originate on our vendors’ systems, which can be\nleveraged to access our websites, platforms, and data, including personal data. We and our vendors have previously\nexperienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in August 2022, we reported an incident\naffecting one of our vendors that resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of certain consumers and\nDashers. We have undertaken steps to enhance our cybersecurity and governance program, which include adding\nsecurity layers around data, improving access controls, hiring additional personnel with cybersecurity experience,\nand using outside expertise to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of these\nincidents have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or other incidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage or exfiltrate data from information systems\nchange frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable\nto anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate detective or preventive\nmeasures, and we and our vendors may face delays in our response to or remediation of breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems used in our\nbusiness through various means. In addition, there have been, and may in the future be additional, attempts to\nfraudulently induce our employees, merchants, consumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names,\npasswords, payment card information, or other sensitive information resulting in user account takeovers or the\nfraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. With the prevalence of remote work, we may also be exposed to increased\nrisks of breaches or incidents via these or other methods.\nAlthough we have taken measures to monitor and protect our systems and the data in our possession, these measures\nhave not fully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. Our IT and\ninfrastructure may be vulnerable to viruses, phishing and other forms of social engineering, denial-of-service,\ncredential stuffing, ransomware and other malware, insecure third-party libraries, application or network\nvulnerabilities, reliance on third-party vendors for patches, unauthorized configurations, employee error and\nmalfeasance, and other sources of disruption or unauthorized access, and, as a result, unauthorized parties may be\nable to access our systems and data, including personal data and other sensitive and proprietary data, through our\nsystems. Although we have policies and technical controls restricting the access to and sharing of the data we\nstore, as well as requiring encryption of data where appropriate, these policies and controls may not be effective\nin all cases. Any actual or perceived breach or incident could interrupt our operations, harm our reputation,\nbrand, and competitive position, result in our platform being unavailable, loss or improper access to, or\nunavailability of, data, fraudulent transfer of funds, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and significant\nlegal, regulatory, and financial exposure. Any such actual or perceived breaches or incidents or any perception\nthat our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or Dasher confidence in, or\ndecreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations. Further, any cybersecurity attacks or actual or perceived breaches or other incidents directed at,\nor suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a result, reduce\nconfidence in us.\nAny actual or perceived breach or other security incident impacting any entities with which we share or disclose\ndata (including, for example, our vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security\nmeasures and respond to any incidents impacting them is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant\nsupply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not been breached or that they\ndo not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other\ndisruption to, our or our vendors’ systems.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance that may help provide\ncoverage for these types of incidents and resulting claims, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will\nbe adequate for liabilities incurred relating to any breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be\navailable to us on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any\nfuture claim. The successful assertion of any claim against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or\nchanges in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-\ninsurance requirements, could have an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\n63\nTable of Contents\nIf the on-demand local commerce category does not continue to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe on-demand local commerce category has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is uncertain\nto what extent the market for local commerce platforms will continue to grow. The markets for certain services we\nfacilitate, in particular convenience, grocery, advertising, and certain other categories, are in earlier stages of\ndevelopment than our restaurant category, and it is uncertain whether demand for these services will continue to\ngrow and achieve stable, widespread market acceptance. In addition, through both organic and inorganic growth, we\nhave entered geographies where the development of the on-demand local commerce category is in different stages of\nmarket acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt on-\ndemand local commerce platforms. If merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to on-demand local\ncommerce platforms as we expect, including as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other\nreasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead\nadopt alternative solutions that may arise, then the market for our platform may not further develop or may develop\nslower than we expect, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe are committed to the long-term success of our business, including by expanding our platform and enhancing the\nconsumer experience, which may not maximize short-term financial results and may yield results that conflict with\nthe market’s expectations, which could result in our stock price being adversely affected.\nWe are committed to the long-term success of our business, including by expanding our platform and enhancing the\nconsumer experience, which we believe will ultimately drive long-term shareholder value. However, expanding our\nplatform and continually enhancing the consumer experience requires steady and significant investments, which may\nnot necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business decisions that may negatively\nimpact our short-term financial results when we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve\nthe consumer experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These decisions\nmay not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term\nbenefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third party\nservice providers, whether or not occurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely\naffect our business, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third party\nservice providers, including the activities of former consumers and Dashers or individuals who are impersonating\nconsumers, merchants, Dashers, or other third party service providers, have occurred, and in the future may occur,\nwhich could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations. These activities\ninclude food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, dangerous or unlawful\nvehicular operation, assault, battery, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or bank accounts,\nregistering consumer, merchant, or Dasher accounts with us using stolen personal information or altered\nidentification documents, additional forms of identity theft, and other misconduct. Such activities have resulted\nin, and may in the future result in, physical injury, loss of life, property and financial damage for consumers,\nmerchants, Dashers, and other third parties, business disruption, reputational and brand damage, or other\nsignificant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card, debit card, or bank account information, fraud with respect to background checks,\nfraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, exploitation of system bugs or\nvulnerabilities to circumvent payment requirements, account takeovers of merchant, consumer, or Dasher accounts by\nbad actors, other unauthorized uses of another person's identity, and use of fraudulent identification documents.\nFor example, bad actors have created consumer, merchant, and Dasher accounts using stolen personal identifying\ninformation for illicit purposes. Among other things, this has caused Form 1099s in the United States, and the\nequivalent in other countries with similar reporting obligations, to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not\nperforming services as Dashers. In addition, under current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders\nfacilitated on our platform with fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved\nthe credit card transaction.\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nillegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities of merchants, consumers, Dashers, and other third party\nservice providers, these measures may not adequately address or prevent all such activity from occurring or scale\nefficiently with our business and such conduct could expose us to liability, including through litigation or\nregulatory action, or adversely affect our brand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to\nguard against these illegal, improper, or\n64\nTable of Contents\notherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check where\npermitted by applicable law, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good\nstanding from using our platform, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and\ntransparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, or if our competitors do not adopt similar measures, the\ngrowth of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be adversely affected. Any\nnegative publicity related to incidents involving illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, or the\nmeasures we adopt to mitigate the risk of such incidents, whether such incidents occurred on our platform or on our\ncompetitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a\nwhole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory\nor litigation exposure.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which sometimes includes facilitating deliveries to\nconsumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less\noperationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner\nmerchants’ systems. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order and a higher\nlikelihood of errors. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with\nfacilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nSome non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. There is a\nrisk that non-partner merchants will bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. In\naddition, measures have been enacted in many U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit, among other things, on-demand local\ncommerce platforms like ours from facilitating deliveries from restaurants without the restaurants’ prior consent.\nWe have adopted internal policies pursuant to which we do not add new non-partner restaurants for delivery on our\nplatform in the United States. However, we may continue to add non-partner merchants in categories other than\nrestaurants. We may also continue to revise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and\nother merchants. To the extent we are required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this\nmay adversely affect our ability to provide a broad selection of merchants on our platform, attract and retain\nconsumers and could directly and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, we do\nnot successfully manage our platform strategy, or we are not able to keep pace with technological developments, we\nmay not remain competitive and our business and results of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsites and mobile applications, our technology infrastructure, and the suite of merchant services that we offer\nthrough our platform. To compete effectively, we must also provide a convenient, efficient, and reliable merchant\nand consumer experience on our platform, and we may be unable to effectively address merchant and consumer needs or\nidentify emerging consumer trends.\nIn addition, any new products or services that we develop may not be introduced in a timely or cost-effective\nmanner, may contain errors or defects, or may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate\nsufficient revenue. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers may delay adoption and use of new products and services to\npermit them to make a more thorough evaluation of those products and services and to compare them against\npotentially competitive products in the market. Further, we may make changes to our platform and platform strategy\nthat merchants, consumers, or Dashers do not find useful and we may discontinue certain products, services, or\nfeatures that our merchants, consumers, or Dashers have otherwise enjoyed. To the extent that discontinued\nproducts, services, or features remain subject to a current contract with the applicable third party, we may incur\ncosts with respect to our determination to discontinue those products, services, or features. Failure to\neffectively manage our platform and platform strategy could lead to merchant, consumer, or Dasher dissatisfaction\nand contractual liabilities, which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If existing and new\nmerchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to be\nreliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform, we\nmay not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform, any\nof which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, if competitors introduce new features, offerings, or technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices or consumer trends emerge, our existing technology, services, websites, and mobile applications may\nbecome less popular or obsolete. For example, companies operating in different industries are developing and have\nbegun implementing\n65\nTable of Contents\nautonomous technologies, and we believe that they may use these technologies to compete with us in the delivery or\nlogistics industries. Our competitors may develop and commercialize autonomous and drone delivery technologies at\nscale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or drone delivery to market\nbefore we do, or their technology is, or is perceived to be, superior to our or our partners’ technology, they may\nbe able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. Our future success could depend in large part on our ability to\ninvest in, develop, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices in a cost-\neffective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to, and new services on, our platform, including our underlying technology infrastructure,\nmay involve significant technical risks, the time and attention of our personnel, including management and key\nemployees, and meaningful upfront capital investments that may not generate return on investment. We may use new\ntechnologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If we face material delays in\nintroducing new or enhanced platform features and services or updated technology infrastructure, or if our recently\nintroduced offerings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that\nutilize our platform may forgo the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses,\nincluding DashMart and Wolt Market. To build and expand our self-operated businesses, we have made substantial\ninvestments, including in establishing and managing a reliable supply chain for in-store products, establishing\nsupply-related contractual partnerships, leasing premises, hiring personnel, and rolling out relevant technologies\nand processes. We plan to continue to invest in such businesses in the future. The maintenance and expansion of our\nself-operated businesses requires significant investments, and there is no assurance that we will realize any of\nthe anticipated benefits. In locations where we operate DashMart and Wolt Market, we may not be able to generate a\nsufficient number of orders to cover our fixed costs and make such services viable and we may incur significant\ncosts before we can determine the viability of these DashMart and Wolt Market locations. Our self-operated retail\nlocations also expose us to different regulatory requirements and risks than our Marketplaces and Commerce\nPlatform, in particular with respect to food safety, permit and license requirements, and zoning restrictions, and\ncertain other business risks, including inventory shrinkage and the impact of changing economic policy on the cost\nof goods resold by DashMart and Wolt Market. Our expansion into convenience, grocery, and other retail categories,\nmay also result in the diversion of management’s attention from other business opportunities as well as the\ndiversion of resources from support functions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business, and attracting merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and we may not generate a meaningful return on these\ninitiatives. Even if we increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the\nadditional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not successful or\ncost-effective, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the gains in efficiency\nto our platform that we expect. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business and subject to a number\nof risks, including changes to our Dasher pay models and changes in macroeconomic conditions. The cost-\neffectiveness of our platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do\nnot reduce the number of defective orders and\n66\nTable of Contents\naccordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are unable to maintain or improve the cost-\neffectiveness of our platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency, Dasher pay, and defective orders, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party customer support\nproviders who are qualified to support users of our platform and well versed in our platform. As we continue to\ngrow our business and improve our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support\nservices at scale. Additionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of users not\nbased in the U.S. on our platform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those\nassociated with delivering support in languages other than English and in ways consistent with the customs and\ndominant technologies used in the various geographies in which we operate. Any failure to maintain high-quality\nsupport, or a perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our reputation and adversely\naffect our ability to scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending habits and Dasher behavior patterns, each of which have a\nsignificant impact on our growth and expenses. We experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the\ncalendar year, although our rapid growth in historical periods has made, and may continue to make, seasonal\nfluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity may be impacted by weather. Colder or more\ninclement weather may increase consumer demand, while warmer or sunny weather may decrease consumer demand. In\ncontrast, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of cold or inclement weather when we need\nmore Dashers available to fulfill orders driven by increased consumer demand. In such instances, we typically rely\non incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs.\nFurther, severe weather can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, making it impossible to fulfill\ndeliveries. We also benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we\nexperience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation\nperiods, causing adverse effects to our business during impacted periods. Seasonality will likely cause\nfluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the\nexisting seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and contribute to greater fluctuations in\nour results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our\nresults of operations and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than\nexpected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny factor that impacts consumer spending broadly, including changes to economic conditions in regions where we do\nbusiness, may also impact consumer spending on our platform. Some of these factors include unemployment, inflation,\nconsumer debt, fluctuations in transportation costs, increased food costs, declines in asset prices, mortgage\nmarkets, taxation, energy prices, changes in interest rates and credit availability, and consumer confidence in the\ncurrent and future political and economic environment. Economic conditions in certain regions may also be affected\nor exacerbated by natural disasters and threats to public health. Additionally, volatility in the global financial\nmarkets, or in specific segments of those markets, may contribute to banks and financial institutions with whom we\nhave banking or payment processing relationships entering receivership or becoming insolvent in the future, and we\nmay be unable to access or may lose some or all of our existing cash and cash equivalents to the extent those funds\nare not insured or otherwise protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other insurance programs.\nSuch volatility may also adversely impact any funds held temporarily at our third-party payment processors.\nIn addition, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors, including changing economic policy. Labor shortages and supply chain\nissues at merchants could negatively impact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume\non our Marketplaces and in our Commerce Platform. Inflationary pressures and changing economic policy could drive\nmerchant prices higher, which could\n67\nTable of Contents\nnegatively impact consumer demand and drive lower order volume on our Marketplaces and in our Commerce Platform.\nSmall businesses that do not have substantial resources, like many of the merchants on our platform, tend to be\nmore adversely affected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform, including\nour small business merchants, cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other\nbusiness disruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be\nless likely to use our platform.\nAs our business has grown, we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse global economic and\npolitical conditions, including changing economic policy and the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. These\nhave had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions in their respective regions and\nhave given rise to volatility and instability in a manner that adversely affects our business and merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers on our platform in those regions.\nWe are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our operations in non-U.S. countries. When\nconducting business in non-U.S. countries, including through Wolt and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nbusiness is typically denominated in the local currency of the respective country, which exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposure is currently to the Euro,\nthe Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel, and the Australian dollar. Additionally, because our financial statements\nare presented in U.S. dollars, local functional currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable\nexchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements, thereby increasing our foreign exchange translation risk.\nThe purchase price of the proposed acquisition of Deliveroo is denominated in GBP. To hedge the risk of\nappreciation in GBP, we entered into the Deal-Contingent Forward, which is discussed in Note 14 - \"Derivative\"\nincluded in Part I, Item 1, \"Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements\" of this Quarterly Report on Form\n10-Q. The fair value of the Deal-Contingent Forward at each reporting date will depend on various assumptions as\nwell as changes in the GBP/U.S. dollar exchange rate, which \"may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations\nthat are beyond our control. We expect to record fair value gains or losses, which may be significant, through the\ncondensed consolidated statement of operations until the closing of the Deliveroo Transaction.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity, which\nmay reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and\nequity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train,\nand integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency,\n68\nTable of Contents\nability to meet forecasts, and employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\nan increasing share of our workforce working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and spending less time collaborating\nin offices;\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; and\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\"). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to\nincrease our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-\nconsuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations. We also need to implement, integrate, and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting at companies we acquire, and any failure to do so could impact our ability to meet our\nfinancial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management\n69\nTable of Contents\nevaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic\nreports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over\nfinancial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information,\nwhich would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are\nunable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\nexcessive number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return\nto our platform as often in the future, or at all. This could adversely affect our ability to attract merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not\neffectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and\nnetwork architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in\ncompetitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions into our platform, offerings, services, and features, and\nin support of internal business operations, and these applications may become important in our operations over\ntime. The procurement of third-party AI tools and the development of our own have required and are expected to\ncontinue requiring significant investment, and if, for the reasons described below and other reasons, we are unable\nto realize the benefits of this investment, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or\nmore successfully than us, or otherwise leverage AI in a manner that adversely impacts our business, which could\nimpair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, if the\ncontent, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are or are alleged to be deficient,\ninaccurate, inappropriate, or biased, or if the use of AI results in, or is alleged to have resulted in, the\ninfringement of the intellectual property of third parties or violations of other rights of third parties, we may\nbe subject to legal claims or liability and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be\nadversely affected. The use of AI applications may result in data leakage or unauthorized exposure of data,\nincluding confidential business information, the personal data of end users, or other sensitive information. Such\nleakage or unauthorized exposure of data related to the use of AI applications could result in legal claims or\nliability or otherwise adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. AI also presents emerging ethical\nand regulatory issues and if our use of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm,\ncompetitive harm, or legal liability. The rapid evolution of AI, including the development of government regulation\nof AI and automated decision-making technology more generally, may require significant resources to develop, test,\nand maintain our platform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI and automated decision-making\ntechnology more generally in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations and ethically in order to\nminimize unintended, harmful impact.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and has contained in the past, and may contain in the\nfuture, undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may only be discovered after the code has been\nreleased. Our practice\n70\nTable of Contents\nis to effect frequent releases of software updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that\nwe incorporate into our platform may also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities\ndiscovered in our code or from third-party software after release could result in negative publicity and a loss of\nusers, revenue, and availability of our platform, as well as other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could\nalso be exploited by malicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result\nin a security breach or other security incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development\nresources to analyze, correct, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate\nvulnerabilities. Any failure to timely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects, or vulnerabilities could\nadversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result\nin dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” with respect to RSUs we issue to employees and service providers, pursuant to\nwhich shares with a market value equivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of\nthe RSUs upon vesting and settlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales\nare remitted by us to the taxing authorities. Some holders may instead elect to pay cash directly to us to cover\nsuch withholding obligations, but in a significant majority of cases, shares are sold on behalf of each holder upon\nthe vesting and settlement of the RSUs. While such sales do not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us\nto satisfy the tax withholding obligations for RSUs, such sales cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the\nextent a large number of shares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our\nstock price to fluctuate.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts, key business and non-\nGAAP metrics, such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, and certain other metrics required by\nregulatory and administrative bodies, such as the monthly active recipients of our services in the EU (as required\nby Article 24(2) of the Digital Services Act), with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified\nby any third party and those operational metrics may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third\nparties due to differences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and\ntools have a number of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which\ncould result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. In addition, while\nwe track these metrics during the quarter, system limitations and the auditing process may result in the metrics\nthat we publicly disclose differing materially from the estimated amounts that were tracked during that same\nperiod. If the internal systems and tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or\ncontain algorithmic or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are\nbased on what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there\nare inherent challenges in measuring how our platform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy\nof our operating metrics could be impacted by fraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there\nare consumers who have multiple accounts, even though this is prohibited in our terms of service and we implement\nmeasures to detect and prevent this behavior. Consumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the\nnumber of consumers on our platform. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with\nrespect to the data that we measure may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could\naffect our long-term strategies. If our operating metrics are not accurate representations of our business, if\ninvestors do not perceive our operating metrics to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with\nrespect to these figures, investors may lose confidence in our operating metrics and business and we expect that we\ncould be subject to legal claims, including securities class action lawsuits, and our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany loss adjustment expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions and\ninsurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive modeling\nand actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is\n71\nTable of Contents\ninherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial projections make no provision for the\nextraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently represented in the historical data or\nwhich are not yet quantifiable. A number of external factors can affect the actual losses incurred for any given\nclaim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open, the limits and coverage of auto\ninsurance carried by Dashers or otherwise generally offered with respect to personal auto insurance, fluctuations\nin healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected events such as\nnatural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such factors can impact the reserves for claims\nincurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves for claims incurred\nbut not yet reported and any loss adjustment expenses for current and historical periods. For any of the foregoing\nreasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the aggregate, from the\ninsurance reserves reflected in our financial statements. If we determine that our estimated insurance reserves are\ninadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the determination, which could result in an\nincrease to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined and negatively impact our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, it could have an adverse effect that is material to our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in non-U.S.\njurisdictions, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. Laws\nand regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors vary by jurisdiction and are\nsubject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and\nunpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and consumers that use our platform.\nWhile we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors,\nDashers may be reclassified as employees due to changes in the law or its interpretation. Depending on the\njurisdiction and the extent of our operations in each such jurisdiction, a reclassification of Dashers as employees\ncould have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition, and results of operations,\nincluding as a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to PAGA and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly\nalter our existing business model and operations in order to continue to operate our platform in that jurisdiction,\nwhich would result in significant increased costs and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain\nDashers on our platform, which\n72\nTable of Contents\ncould have an adverse effect that is material to our business, financial condition, and results of operations. A\nreclassification of Dashers as employees could also result in an increase to the fees we charge to consumers and\nthe commissions we charge to merchants, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain consumers and\nmerchant partners, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought,\nfor example, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we\nmisclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees.\nSeveral jurisdictions, including in the United States, have modified, or are considering modifying, their standards\nused to determine worker classification. For example, Proposition 22, which preserves flexibility for California\nDashers, took effect in 2020. Jurisdictions that have passed or may pass laws protecting Dashers’ independent\ncontractor status may impose new obligations that increase our costs. For example, certain provisions of\nProposition 22 regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in\nCalifornia. These provisions have increased our costs related to Dashers in California. To offset a portion of\nthese increased costs, in certain circumstances we charge higher fees and commissions, which have resulted in, and\nin the future could result in, lower order volumes over time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to\nincrease fees and commissions, these increased costs could also lead to a lower Adjusted EBITDA and earnings per\nshare.\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate have adopted or may be considering, or in the future may consider,\nadopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or\nvoluntary agreements with third parties, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections\nand benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation,\nballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or agreements, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in\nsuch jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if it becomes\nnecessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely affect our results\nof operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation\ncould still be challenged and subject to litigation.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. For example, in May 2025, the Supreme Administrative Court in Finland issued a decision that courier\npartners in Finland were employees, but excluded from the Working Hours Act, resulting in Wolt not being\nresponsible for keeping statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. We are, and may continue to be,\nsubject to similar actions in other jurisdictions. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing the\nstandards used to determine worker classification, which may impact the classification of Dashers using our\nplatform. For example, the EU's Platform Work Directive, which entered into force in December 2024, requires EU\nmember states to transpose its requirements to their national laws, including enacting new national laws for\ndetermining worker classification of platform workers, and may involve differing implementation by the various\nmember states. Such EU-wide legislative reforms may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent\ncontractor model within the European Economic Area (the \"EEA\").\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, or for\nother reasons, we may decide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does, for example, in Germany, which\ncould result in certain operational challenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain\njurisdictions or decide not to expand our business in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth\nand expansion opportunities.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result.\nWe face potential liability, legal expenses, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business\ngenerally, and with the delivery services we facilitate in particular. Specifically, we are subject to claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands, and other legal, regulatory, and\nother administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker\nclassification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints,\nintellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and other matters, and we\n73\nTable of Contents\nmay become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and legal or regulatory\nproceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services. We are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other\nlegal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the actions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to threatened and\nactual legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could\ndo so in the future as well. If any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our platform that\ngenerate a significant percentage of our overall business, it could cause considerable harm to our business.\nFurther, food and other products that are ordered through our platform could be subject to a recall, but we may\nhave limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses,\nfood and other product recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or\ndelivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, or any related injuries to, or\ndeaths of, any consumers or Dashers, could, as a result of negative publicity about the restaurant or grocery\nindustry, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to Dasher\nearnings, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including our\nbackground check processes, removal of platform access, and the nature and frequency of our communications to\nDashers via email, text, or telephone. We also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class\nactions, by or relating to consumers regarding, among other things, disclosures we make with respect to sales tax,\nconsumer fees, gratuities, sign up and cancellation of subscription services, the local delivery fulfillment\nservices we facilitate, discrepancies between the items on our websites and consumer applications and the items\nadvertised at the merchants from which such items are delivered, and the nature and frequency of our marketing\ncommunications to consumers via email, text, or telephone. In addition, we face potential liability and expense for\nclaims, including class, collective, and other representative actions, by or relating to merchants regarding, among\nother things, menu pricing, exclusivity arrangements, and the listing of merchants on our platform without an\nagreement. Finally, we face potential liability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish\non our websites and mobile applications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation,\nlibel, and negligence, among others.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands,\nor other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us,\nwhether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation,\nrequire significant management attention, and divert significant resources. It is possible that a resolution of one\nor more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining reserves for our pending\nlitigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation.\nThere is no guarantee that our litigation reserves will be sufficient to offset such liabilities. These proceedings\ncould also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders\nrequiring a change in our business practices. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other\nlegal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and\ncurrent and former directors and officers. Any of these outcomes and obligations could adversely affect our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, we include arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform.\nThese provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some\ncases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in court. However, arbitration can be costly and\nburdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our\nreputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize\nthese risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or\nbe required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which\ncould also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between U.S. state and federal law, there is a risk that some\nor all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or\nin part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such\n74\nTable of Contents\ndisputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially costly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have exposure to taxing authorities successfully asserting that we have not properly collected or remitted, or\nin the future should collect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, similar taxes or withholding\ntaxes, and successfully imposing additional obligations or liabilities on us, and any such assessments,\nobligations, or liabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of\nthe fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of\nthe Internet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain and could exceed the amount of applicable reserves, if any. In addition to\nour own potential liability, if we or merchants pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to\nconsumers, our order volume may decline.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and gross receipt\ntaxes, in the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions where we operate. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and\nremit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our\ncalculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do\nnot currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, including tax on the cost of goods sold, and could\nimpose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect\ntaxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so, to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which\nwe currently collect taxes, or to collect, remit or pay taxes that are otherwise the responsibility of our vendors\nand partners, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as penalties and\ninterest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, even where we are collecting taxes and\nremitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and remit such\ntaxes.\nThe United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in substantial financial liability and other consequences to us if we were\nunable to remedy such failures in a timely manner.\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which could result in legislative\naction to increase indirect taxes, including digital services taxes. Such legislative action could discourage\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our provision for (benefit\nfrom) income taxes is a function of the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations\nor laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. The determination of our worldwide\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management\nand, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the applicable\nlaw and the ultimate tax determination are uncertain. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from)\nincome taxes is reasonable, the ultimate outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements\nand could materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business operations,\nacquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes in our stock price, intercompany\ntransactions, changes in law or administrative interpretations thereof, changes in accounting principles, changes\nto our forecasts of income and\n75\nTable of Contents\nloss, changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates, certain non-\ndeductible expenses, or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nLegislative changes or administrative practices may increase our tax obligations and exposures and could adversely\naffect our business results and operations.\nThe U.S. federal, state, and local governments, as well as a number of other countries and organizations, such as\nthe European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes\nto existing tax laws and regimes that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do\nbusiness. In addition, regulatory and other guidance, including case law, with respect to existing tax laws are\nconstantly evolving. If one or more of these jurisdictions change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge our\ninterpretations of existing or new tax laws or their application, including how or where our profits and losses are\ncurrently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations may be adversely impacted. For example, an increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have\nadopted laws, administrative practices or interpretations that impose new tax measures, including but not limited\nto, revenue-based taxes and additional reporting obligations, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of\ngoods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption, value added, or other\ntaxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third-party\nobligations.\nJurisdictions have also proposed or enacted taxes on gross revenue derived from, for example, sales of online\nadvertising services and the provision of digital intermediary services such as the operation of online\nmarketplaces. Proliferation of these or similar tax measures may continue unless broader international tax reform\nis implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by additional taxes imposed on\nus prospectively or retroactively, or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the failure to comply with any\ncollection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers, and other third parties\nfor tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases, we also may not have sufficient notice to\nenable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or collection obligations by\nthe effective date.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes is subject to limitations.\nWhile federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to\nexpiration, the deductibility of such NOL carryforwards is limited to 80% of our federal taxable income. Our state\nand non-U.S. NOLs have varying expiration dates going forward. Utilization of our NOL carryforwards depends on our\nfuture taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing NOL carryforwards and tax credits in various\njurisdictions could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future taxable\nincome. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), loss\nutilization is limited if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a greater than 50\npercentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of stockholders\nover a three-year period. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience ownership\nchanges in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control. As a\nresult, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal taxable\nincome or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in increased\nfuture tax liability to us.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, Dasher deactivations, insurance, merchant pricing and\ncommissions, consumer fees, subscriptions, and taxes. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as\nworker classification or our relationship with Dashers more generally (for example, those concerning Dasher pay and\ninsurance requirements), labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other\nhighly regulated products, online payments, gratuities, merchant pricing and commissions, text messaging,\nmembership products, intellectual property, data retention, privacy, data protection, data transfers and sharing,\ncybersecurity, consumer protection, consumer fees, antitrust, background checks, website and mobile application\naccessibility, environmental sustainability and related disclosures, and tax and other government-imposed fees are\noften complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of\nspecificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they\n76\nTable of Contents\nare applicable to us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations\nbetween U.S. law and the laws of other countries, between U.S. state and federal law, between individual states,\nand even at the city and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over\ntime through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing\nbodies. For example, the scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of text\nmessages are continuously evolving and developing and, in particular, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act\nrestricts telemarketing and the use of automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and\nmay in the future result, in civil claims against us.\nWe are subject to regulatory review, proceedings, and audits pursuant to national, federal, state, and local laws\nregulating the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products. These regulations and\nlaws may dictate matters such as licensing, permitting, or other governmental review requirements, advertising\nrestrictions, and consumer age verification. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our operations\nresulting from the enforcement of these existing regulations, any changes to existing regulations or changes to the\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, or the adoption of any new legislation or regulations could\nresult in penalties or cause us to have to suspend sales and delivery of highly regulated products in a\njurisdiction for a period of time or result in increased sales or marketing costs, or changes to our business\npractices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nAs our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, we have become\nsubject to a growing array of laws and regulations, which increase the complexity and compliance risk inherent in\nour business. For example, the EU has recently enacted, and is in the process of enacting, various laws and\nregulations that govern digital services and AI, and impose environmental sustainability obligations and disclosure\nrequirements on businesses like ours. The impact of these new regulations on the overall industry, business models,\nand our operations is uncertain. We may be required to enhance our disclosures and undertake certain changes to our\nproducts, services, fees and commissions structure, and operations, including hiring additional highly specialized\npersonnel, as a result of these new requirements, which could subject us to increased administrative costs. While\nthe EU has since begun to streamline legislation in areas such as digital policy, sustainability, and beyond, it is\nstill too early to determine the extent to which these efforts will reduce administrative burdens.\nIn recent years, regulatory scrutiny of larger companies, technology companies, and companies engaged in dealings\nwith independent contractors has increased. As a result, regulatory and administrative bodies may enact new laws or\npromulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and\nregulations differently than they have in the past in a manner adverse to our business, including by changing\nemployment-related laws, mandating specific earnings standards or other requirements for Dashers, requiring\nbusinesses like ours to maintain specific auto insurance coverage, or by regulating or capping the commissions\nbusinesses like ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in December\n2023, a New York City rule mandating certain minimum earnings standards for certain food delivery workers took\neffect. In addition, some jurisdictions in which we operate have price control measures in effect on local commerce\nplatforms. These price control measures, minimum earnings standards, and other regulations can increase the cost\nand complexity of operating, which has caused, and may in the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to\nconsumers. To the extent that price control measures, minimum earnings standards, or other regulations lead to an\nincrease in the fees we charge to consumers, consumer demand for our services could be reduced, which would further\nharm our business and results of operations. In addition, certain jurisdictions may challenge or seek to regulate\nthe way in which we categorize, disclose, or collect consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of\nChicago has challenged such fees as confusing or misleading to consumers.\nIn addition, there is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment regarding antitrust and\ncompetition matters in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We could be subject to claims\nof violations of competition laws in many aspects of our business, including alleged market sharing, price fixing,\nanticompetitive exclusionary conduct, exchange of competitively sensitive information, and with respect to any\nacquisitions we undertake. For example, in February 2025, Uber filed a lawsuit in California state court alleging\nthat certain of our business practices are anticompetitive. In addition, competition authorities in some of the\njurisdictions in which we operate have made queries regarding, or investigated, our pricing-related terms or other\npractices and, in certain jurisdictions, competition authorities and courts have issued decisions concerning our\npricing-related terms or other practices. Any potential violations of competition laws could result in litigation,\nfines, restrictions on our operations, render applicable provisions or contracts unenforceable, divert management’s\nattention, and lead to claims for damages and reputational harm, each of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and\nregulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a\nresult of lawsuits and legislative\n77\nTable of Contents\nproposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred\nto prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and\nregulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad, including EU anti-money laundering directives and related regulations in connection with our\noperations in Europe. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and\nour employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. These laws may also hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. In addition, we may be subject to liability, including penalties and fines, for any failure to\nsatisfy certain requirements under anti-money laundering laws, such as meeting local “know your customer” and\nongoing due diligence standards. For example, in connection with our operations in Europe, we could be liable for\npenalties of up to 10% of our revenue in a fiscal year in the event that our anti-money laundering compliance\nmeasures are found to be insufficient. All of these laws may also require that we keep accurate books and records\nand maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have\npolicies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents\nwill not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held\nresponsible, and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands, including\nas a result of our acquisition of Wolt, and as we increase sales and operations in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Any\nviolation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could\nresult in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees,\nloss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government\ncontracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse\nconsequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various regulations relating to payment processing.\nThe majority of payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment\nservices, which subjects us to certain payment-related regulations. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. In the United States, money transmitters are\nregulated by numerous state and local governments and agencies, many of which may define \"money transmitter\"\ndifferently. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulations and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties levied by national, federal, state,\nor local regulators in one or more jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services. For example, as a result of our\noperations in Europe, we are subject to the revised EU Payment Services Directive (\"PSD II\") and related\nregulations. One of our subsidiaries acts as an intra-group licensed payment service provider and electronic money\ninstitution for its payment services to merchants in the EEA countries and has obtained a payment institution\nlicense and electronic money license from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with PSD II.\nShould our payment institution or electronic money licenses be revoked in the future, or any other enforcement\nmeasures be taken by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority, such as imposing penalties or forcing us to cease\noffering certain payment facilities, our operations in Europe would be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we\nexpand into new jurisdictions and expand or pursue new business opportunities, the payment-related regulations that\nwe are subject to will expand as well, including, for example, with respect to the provision of payments and\nfinancial services we offer in Israel. In addition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules\nand regulations related to payment processing could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of\nsignificant assets, or other enforcement actions. We could also be required to make significant changes to our\nbusiness practices or compliance programs as a result of regulatory scrutiny, which could interrupt our ability to\noperate in certain jurisdictions and otherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n78\nTable of Contents\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\nInternet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or\nchanges thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and\nincrease the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance\ncosts or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation,\ntariffs, user privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution,\nsocial media marketing, advertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications,\nconsumer protection, broadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is\nnot always clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel,\nand personal privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally,\nit is possible that non-U.S. government entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or\nwebsites or may even attempt to block access to our mobile applications and websites. Any failure, or perceived\nfailure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand,\na loss in business, and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, process, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that use our platform, as well as other personal data relating to our employees and other personnel. We are\nsubject to a growing body of local, municipal, state, federal, national, and international laws and regulations in\nthe jurisdictions where we operate that address privacy and the collection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and\nprotection of certain types of data, which may require the notification of certain security breaches involving\npersonal data. These laws and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope may continually change through new\nlegislation, amendments to existing legislation, or changes in enforcement, and such changes may be inconsistent\nfrom one jurisdiction to another. For example, many U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy legislation\nsimilar to the California Consumer Privacy Act and a growing number of U.S. states have enacted legislation\naddressing other privacy matters, such as cybersecurity and consumer health data and biometrics. With our\noperations in the EU, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, as well as national data protection\nand privacy schemes in other countries in which we operate. Any changes in these laws or regulations or their\ninterpretation or enforcement could add further complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and legal\nrisk; require additional investment of resources in compliance and data management programs; and result in changes\nor increased compliance costs in business practices and policies. For example, new and evolving requirements around\nconsumer health data may restrict our ability to provide personalized content on our platform. These laws also\nimpose strict and sometimes inconsistent requirements relating to the processing of personal data as well as\nsignificant penalties, such as fines, injunctions against the processing of personal data, and civil litigation\nclaims, for noncompliance. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant expenses in our efforts\nto comply with current and evolving privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols imposed by\nlaw, regulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations.\nWe are also subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures designed to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be\ncontractually required to process and secure data in certain manners and to indemnify and hold harmless third\nparties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations\nrelating to privacy, data protection, cybersecurity, or consumer protection.\nAdditionally, our success depends in part on our ability to access, collect, use, and otherwise process data\nrelating to Dashers, merchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as\n“cookies,” is further restricted, regulated, or blocked by new laws, regulations, litigation, or other practices,\nthe amount or accuracy of Internet user information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions have enacted or are considering\nenacting legislation or regulations that significantly restrict the practice of online tracking. Other regulators\nare increasingly scrutinizing the use of online tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the\nonline behavioral advertising ecosystem. Moreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers, such as\nApple and Google, plan to or have implemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block tracking\ntechnologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted,\nsignificantly reduce the effectiveness of such practices and technologies. As a result, we may\n79\nTable of Contents\nhave to develop alternative systems to determine our customers’ behavior, customize their online experience, or\nefficiently market to them.\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law and regulations or our practices\nand platform could be inconsistent with, be alleged to fail, or fail to meet all requirements of, such laws,\nregulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors, merchants, or Dashers on our platform, to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations or any other actual or asserted obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, or cybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or\nrelease of personal data or other data relating to merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other individuals, or the\nperception of privacy concerns or that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could\ndamage our reputation and brand, discourage new and existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers from using our\nplatform, or result in fines, investigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and\nlitigation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance\nproviders are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-\nrelated risks, including auto liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, security and data breaches,\ncrime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business\nliabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire\ninsurance. We may also choose to self-insure for certain types of claims or for certain claims below or above\ncertain dollar amounts. Even if we do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks, we may not obtain enough\ninsurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or\ndeductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable\nto pay any operations-related claims that we make. In addition, if any of our insurance providers terminate their\nrelationship with us or refuse to renew their relationships with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be\nrequired to find alternate insurance providers and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable\nreplacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure\ncertain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of\nthe terms of these merchant agreements and could be subject to additional liabilities as a result.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-\ninsured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. In addition, if we were to experience an\nunusually large amount of operations-related claims that we self-insure, our financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Even if operations-related claims do not result in liability, we may incur\nsignificant costs in investigating and defending against them.\nInsurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a\nresult, our insurance and claims expenses could increase substantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles\nor self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims\nsignificantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience claims in excess of our\ncoverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a\nsignificant claim or claims for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles\nor self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on third-party payment processors to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third parties and other related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily Stripe and\nPayPal. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our\nrelationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to\nrenew their agreements with us\n80\nTable of Contents\non commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment processors and may not be able to\nsecure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and services\nprovided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or\nvulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our\nability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information, or make timely\npayments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of time, make our\nplatform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and adversely affect\nour ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nWe also provide Dashers in the U.S. with access to certain banking services that facilitate, among other things,\nimmediate access to their earnings. Through this offering we act as a service provider to a bank and are\ncontractually bound to adhere to certain banking or financial regulations that could subject us to regulatory\nreview, proceedings, or audits pursuant to federal or state laws, as well as the risk of contractual breach and\nindemnification.\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, banking, anti-money\nlaundering, and similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors or the\nservices that we offer to Dashers, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and\nproceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept\nonline payments or other payment card transactions or provide certain services to Dashers, which could make our\nplatform less convenient and attractive to consumers and Dashers. We also rely on data provided by our payment\nservice provider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in\nsuch data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected. Additionally, these relationships require us to comply with payment card network operating\nrules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks, and certain other banking or financial\nregulations. These networks and other applicable authorities could adopt new rules or regulations or interpret or\nre-interpret existing rules or regulations in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some\nusers or Dashers, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or\nregulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, lose our ability to accept credit and debit\ncard payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, or lose our ability to offer access to\ncertain services that benefit Dashers, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals,\nchargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing\nrisks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers, and if such providers fail to\nprovide accurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on accredited third-party background check providers to assist with\nverifying the authenticity of Dashers and to provide the criminal and/or driving history of potential Dashers and,\nin some cases, existing Dashers, to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to\napplicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such providers\ndo not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable law or regulations.\nIf any of our third-party background check providers fails to perform as expected, terminates its relationship with\nus or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find alternate\nproviders, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. In\ncertain jurisdictions, including Canada and the United States, we currently rely on a single third-party background\ncheck provider. In other jurisdictions, we rely on a very limited number of background check providers. If the need\narises, and we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not\nbe able to timely onboard potential Dashers and, as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential\nDashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background\nchecks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our\nexpectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform and, as a result, we may be\nunable to adequately help protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers. Conversely,\ninaccurate background checks may inadvertently exclude qualified Dashers from our platform. As a result of\ninaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to\nincreased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-\nparty background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may\ncontinue to have access to, and complete deliveries through, our platform.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws,\n81\nTable of Contents\nrules, and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected, and we could face regulatory or legal action, including class, collective, or other representative\nactions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including investigations, lawsuits, inquiries, and demand\nletters, related to our background check review process and the notice requirements around background checks. In\naddition, background check qualification processes may be limited in certain jurisdictions based on national and\nlocal laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose\ninformation that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where there are no industry-specific regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks, in\naccordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we choose background checks that are less thorough in scope\nthan we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or regulation, or if we fail to run additional background\nchecks after Dashers are onboarded, we may face negative publicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other security incidents, or our actual or\nperceived failure to take action on negative results of a background or other check that we may initiate with\nrespect to a Dasher, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased\nregulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nOur platform, services, and operations depend on a wide variety of third-party software and services and any\ninterruption in services provided by these third parties could adversely affect our business and results of\noperations.\nWe have integrations with or otherwise utilize or rely on PayPal, Stripe, Olo, Google Maps, Amazon Web Services\n(\"AWS\"), and a variety of other third-party vendors. Our business would be disrupted, and we may have to seek\nalternative service providers, if any of the third-party software or services we utilize, or functional equivalents\nthereof, were unavailable due to, among other reasons, extended outages or interruptions or because they are no\nlonger available on commercially reasonable terms or prices. Third-party software, applications, products,\nplatforms, and services, and the terms on which they are offered, are constantly evolving, and we may not be able\nto maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings. Updates to third-party\nsoftware that integrates with our offerings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as it previously\nhad or at all. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the\ninteroperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our\nability to operate and distribute our platform. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of our\nplatform or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our platform.\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by AWS, a third-party provider\nof cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We have experienced, and expect that in the\nfuture we will continue to experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability due to a\nvariety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors or misconduct, natural disasters,\ncybersecurity events, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In the event that our agreement with\nAWS is terminated, not available on the same terms, or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we\nmay experience significant costs or downtime, which could adversely affect our business. Although it would be\ndifficult for a number of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud\ninfrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms if it became necessary.\nIn certain markets, we regularly engage fleet companies to fulfill deliveries on our platform. Fleet companies are\nthird parties that provide delivery services using their own workforce or, in some cases, their own subcontractors.\nOur operations in some markets may be heavily dependent on the services of fleet companies. To the extent that we\ndo become reliant on fleet companies in certain markets, it may be difficult to find a suitable replacement for the\nfulfillment services that such fleet companies provide in a timely manner or at all. In addition, if fleet\ncompanies operate below appropriate quality standards or have compliance or other regulatory issues, our business,\nreputation and results of operations could be adversely affected in those markets. Although we contractually\nrequire our fleet partners to comply with applicable law in their operations, we do not control these companies and\nany non-compliance with applicable law has resulted in, and may in the future result in, increased legal and\nregulatory exposure and increased resourcing needs. In the event that our relationship with any of our key\npartners, including fleet companies, deteriorates, whether as a result of business disputes, regulatory issues, or\ndegrading quality of services, we may experience difficulties maintaining our operations in impacted markets, which\ncould adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n82\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within\nsuch application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that\nreduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could\ndecline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If\nsuch mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications\navailable to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications,\ngive preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose\nterms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us,\nor if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than\nthe placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms\nwill continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these\ndevices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed\nto work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful\nin developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’\nexperience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or\nusing our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating\nsystems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, in 2021, Apple imposed\nrequirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and implemented an application tracking\ntransparency framework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. These changes have, and we\nexpect that these changes will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions.\nIf we are unable to mitigate the effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new\nusers as well as order rates from existing consumers on our platform.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear\nprominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through Internet search results on search engines\nlike Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to how and\nwhere our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its\nranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not\nbe prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of\nconsumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual\n83\nTable of Contents\nproperty, or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of\nour confidential information or technology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to\nprotect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software,\ntechnology, and functionality, obtain and use information that we consider proprietary, or use branding that is\nconfusingly similar to our own. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or successfully endeavor, to\nobtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through various methods, including\nthrough cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be inadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may\ncontinue to adopt and use service names and domain names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build\nbrand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or\ntrademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks or domain\nnames. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and\nadministrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual\nproperty rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not\ntimely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property.\nOur efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in\nsubstantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under open source licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source\nlicenses to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software license.\nThis could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately\ncould result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected portions of our source\ncode, we could be required to purchase additional licenses and expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer\nsome or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software until we can adequately\naddress the concerns.\n84\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or non-U.S. courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nThere have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of\nwhat we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the\nterms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be\nrequired to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on terms that are not\neconomically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-\nengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our\nproprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nOur indebtedness and liabilities could limit the cash flow available for our operations, expose us to risks that\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to\nsatisfy our obligations under our debt agreements.\nWe have a revolving credit facility that we may draw on to finance our working capital and other general corporate\npurposes, and have $2.75 billion in aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our 2030 Notes. We\nmay also incur additional indebtedness to meet future financing needs. Our indebtedness could have significant\nnegative consequences for our security holders and our business, results of operations and financial condition by,\namong other things:\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\nrequiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness,\nwhich will reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes;\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business;\ndiluting the interests of our existing stockholders as a result of issuing shares of our Class A common stock\nupon conversion of the 2030 Notes; and\nplacing us at a possible competitive disadvantage with competitors that are less leveraged than us or have better\naccess to capital.\nOur business may not generate sufficient funds, and we may otherwise be unable to maintain sufficient cash\nreserves, to pay amounts due under our indebtedness, and our cash needs may increase in the future. In addition,\nour existing indebtedness contains, and any future indebtedness that we may incur may contain, financial and other\nrestrictive covenants that limit our ability to operate our business, raise capital or make payments under our\nother indebtedness. If we fail to comply with these covenants or to make payments under our indebtedness when due,\nthen we would be in default under that indebtedness, which could, in turn, result in that and our other\nindebtedness becoming immediately payable in full.\nWe may be unable to raise the funds necessary to repurchase the 2030 Notes for cash following a fundamental change,\nor to pay any cash amounts due upon conversion, and our other indebtedness limits our ability to repurchase the\n2030 Notes or pay cash upon their conversion.\nHolders of our 2030 Notes may, subject to a limited exception set forth in the related Indenture, require us to\nrepurchase their 2030 Notes following a fundamental change at a cash repurchase price generally equal to the\nprincipal amount of the 2030 Notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if\nany, to, but excluding the fundamental change repurchase date. Upon maturity of the 2030 Notes, we must pay their\nprincipal amount and accrued and unpaid special and additional interest, if any, in cash, unless they have been\npreviously repurchased, redeemed or converted. In addition, all conversions of 2030 Notes will be settled partially\nor entirely in cash. We may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are\nrequired to repurchase the 2030 Notes or pay the cash\n85\nTable of Contents\namounts due upon their maturity or conversion. In addition, applicable law, regulatory authorities and the\nagreements governing our other indebtedness may restrict our ability to repurchase the 2030 Notes or pay the cash\namounts due upon conversion. Our failure to repurchase 2030 Notes or to pay the cash amounts due upon conversion\nwhen required will constitute a default under the Indenture. A default under the Indenture or the fundamental\nchange itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our other indebtedness, and may result in\nthat other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy all\namounts due under the other indebtedness and the 2030 Notes.\nThe accounting method for the 2030 Notes could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results.\nThe accounting method for reflecting the 2030 Notes on our balance sheet, accruing amortized interest expense for\nthe 2030 Notes, and reflecting the underlying shares of our Class A common stock in our reported diluted earnings\nper share may adversely affect our reported earnings and financial condition. Furthermore, if any of the conditions\nto the convertibility of the 2030 Notes is satisfied, then we may be required under applicable accounting standards\nto reclassify the liability carrying value of the 2030 Notes as a current, rather than a long-term, liability. This\nreclassification could be required even if no noteholders convert their 2030 Notes and could materially reduce our\nreported working capital.\nThe convertible note hedge and warrant transactions may affect the value of the 2030 Notes and our Class A common\nstock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2030 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge\ntransactions with certain financial institutions (the “option counterparties”). We also entered into warrant\ntransactions with such option counterparties pursuant to which we sold warrants for the purchase of our Class A\ncommon stock. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon\nany conversion of the 2030 Notes and/or offset any potential cash payments we are required to make in excess of the\nprincipal amount of the converted 2030 Notes, as the case may be. However, the warrant transactions could\nseparately have a dilutive effect on our Class A common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our\nClass A common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants unless, subject to the terms of the warrant\ntransactions, we elect to cash settle the warrants.\nFrom time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify or unwind their hedge\npositions by entering into or unwinding derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or\nselling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity\nof the 2030 Notes (and (i) are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of 2030 Notes\nor following redemption of the 2030 Notes by us or following any repurchase of the 2030 Notes by us in connection\nwith any fundamental change and (ii) are likely to do so following any repurchase of the 2030 Notes by us other\nthan in connection with any such redemption or fundamental change if we elect to unwind a corresponding portion of\nthe convertible note hedge transactions in connection with such repurchase). This activity could cause or avoid an\nincrease or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock or the 2030 Notes.\nWe cannot predict the direction or magnitude of any potential effect that the transactions described above may have\non the price of the 2030 Notes or the shares of our Class A common stock. In addition, we cannot make any\nrepresentation that the option counterparties or their respective affiliates will engage in these transactions or\nthat these transactions, once commenced, will not be discontinued without notice.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the convertible note hedge transactions, and the convertible\nnote hedge transactions may not operate as planned.\nWe are subject to the risk that any of the option counterparties to the convertible note hedge transactions may\ndefault under the convertible note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties\nunder the convertible note hedge transactions is not secured by any collateral. In the past, economic conditions\nhave resulted in the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of a number of financial institutions,\nincluding the bankruptcy filing by Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and various of its affiliates. If an option\ncounterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings\nwith a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with them. Our exposure will depend on many\nfactors. Generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price and in the\nvolatility of our Class A common stock. In addition, as a result of a default by any counterparty to the\nconvertible note hedge transactions, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and more dilution than we currently\nanticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or\nviability of any counterparty under the convertible note hedge transactions.\n86\nTable of Contents\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nTo support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make\nsignificant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth\nand may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new platform\nfeatures and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating and technology\ninfrastructure, acquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic\nconditions. We believe our working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at\nleast the next 12 months and beyond. We may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures,\nstrategic initiatives, or investments and our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future\nissuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could\nsuffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges\nsuperior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We may evaluate financing opportunities from time to\ntime, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business\nplans, and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not\nbe able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate\nfinancing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our\nbusiness growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole, pay\ndividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments and loans, or engage in transactions with\naffiliates. We are also required to comply with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined\nin accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our\ncurrent and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital\nneeds. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our\nbusiness strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies which are not subject to such\nrestrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility, to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, and to require cash collateral for\nany outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. If not waived, these defaults could\nalso cause our other then-outstanding indebtedness, including the 2030 Notes, to become immediately due and\npayable. If the debt under our revolving credit facility or other outstanding indebtedness were to be accelerated\nor such cash collateral were to be required under our revolving credit facility, we may not have sufficient cash or\nbe able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could\nimmediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we\nwere able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable\nto us. As of June 30, 2025, there were no revolving loans outstanding and $42 million in aggregate face amount of\nletters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of June 30, 2025, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of LaunchPad, and a member\nof our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of our board of\ndirectors collectively held 55% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate, which voting\npower may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards (including those\nequity awards granted to our\n87\nTable of Contents\nCo-Founders prior to our initial public offering and subject to equity exchange right agreements whereby each of\nour Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any shares of Class A common stock\nreceived upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or the vesting and settlement of\nRSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock). If all\nsuch equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had been exercised or vested and\nexchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of June 30, 2025, our Co-Founders would collectively hold 65% of\nthe voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-Founders have also entered into the Voting Agreement,\nwhereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B\ncommon stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at\nhis discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to determine or\nsignificantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board\nof directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any\nmerger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu\nmay have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to\nyour interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in\ncontrol of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital\nstock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFurther, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our\nCo-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions\nthat would be desirable for himself or our Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, which we\nsometimes refer to herein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total\ndisability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as\ndirected by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person,\nthen our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and\nno more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61\ndays and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an\nofficer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result\nof Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our\nstockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which\nsuch final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date.\"\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of\nour total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the\noutcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would\nhave no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting\ndilution, which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common\nstock to Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares\nof Class C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has\nbeen met. As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s\ncontrol of our voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most\nmatters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our\nCo-Founders and, in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve\nliquidity in their holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C\ncommon stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of\nNasdaq.\n88\nTable of Contents\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of Nasdaq, we\nexpect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain\nreduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of June 30, 2025, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of Nasdaq. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of the voting power for\nthe election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may\nelect not to comply with certain listing standards of Nasdaq regarding corporate governance, including requirements\nthat a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, a compensation committee be composed of\nindependent directors, and that there is independent director oversight over the director nomination process.\nSuch corporate governance requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the\n“controlled company” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely\non these exemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing\nstandards of Nasdaq. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq, which could adversely affect the protections for other\nstockholders.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these\nestimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n89\nTable of Contents\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nThe trading volume of the 2030 Notes and the conversion features of the 2030 Notes, if triggered, may impact the\ntrading price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors\nwho view the 2030 Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage\ntrading activity that we expect to develop involving our Class A common stock in connection with the 2030 Notes.\nAdditionally, the market price of our Class A common stock could adversely impact the trading price of the 2030\nNotes.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the 2030 Notes is triggered, holders of the 2030 Notes will be\nentitled to convert their 2030 Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. Any such conversions\nwill be required to be settled partially or entirely in cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. If we\nelect to satisfy a portion of our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our Class A common stock, the\nissuance will cause dilution to our existing shareholders and could cause the market price of our Class A common\nstock to decline.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously registered shares for future issuance\nunder our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the\nshares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be\navailable for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or other securities\nthat are convertible into, or exercisable for, our equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we\ndeem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it\nmore difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to\nrepurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock\nprice.\nIn February 2025, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount of up to $5.0 billion. Under existing or any future share repurchase\nprograms, we may make share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share market purchases, block\ntransactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our\nshare repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares,\nand may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases,\nif any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal\nrequirements, such as Delaware surplus and solvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any\nfailure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and\ninvestor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would\nbe and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance\nlong-\n90\nTable of Contents\nterm stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common stock\nmay decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce\nthe effectiveness of our repurchase programs.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements,\nand we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws\nand the Indenture could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market\nprice of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nCertain provisions in the Indenture could make a third-party attempt to acquire us more difficult or expensive. For\nexample, if a takeover constitutes a fundamental change, then, except as set forth in the Indenture, noteholders\nwill have the right to require us to repurchase their 2030 Notes for cash. In addition, if a takeover constitutes a\nmake-whole fundamental change, then we may be required to temporarily increase the conversion rate. In either case,\nand in other cases, our obligations under the 2030 Notes and the Indenture could increase the cost of acquiring us\nor otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management, including in a\ntransaction that noteholders or holders of our Class A common stock may view as favorable.\n91\nTable of Contents\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and\nrestated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state\nor federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our\nmarket, or if they change their analysis regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading\nvolume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their analysis regarding our Class A common stock adversely, publish more favorable analyses about\nour competitors than us, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our\nsecurities would likely decline.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate declaring or paying\nany dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.\n92\nTable of Contents",
