Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its\nwholly-owned subsidiaries and entities consolidated under the variable interest entity model, and have been\nprepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and\nthe requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim reporting. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThese unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements reflect all normal recurring adjustments that\nare, in the opinion of management, necessary to fairly present the information set forth herein. They should be\nread in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in the Company’s\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results for a full year.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of condensed consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make\ncertain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the\nrelated disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and\nexpenses during the periods presented. Estimates include, but are not limited to, revenue recognition, allowances\nfor credit losses, gift card breakage, estimated useful lives of property and equipment, capitalized software and\nwebsite development costs, intangible assets, valuation of stock-based compensation, valuation of investments and\nother financial instruments including valuation of investments without readily determinable fair values, valuation\nof acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the incremental borrowing rate applied in lease accounting, impairment\nof long-lived assets, insurance reserves, loss contingencies, and income and indirect taxes. Actual results could\ndiffer from these estimates.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIn June 2024, the Company ceased use of and made available for sublease certain corporate office spaces. As a\nresult, the Company determined that the asset groups which primarily consist of the related operating lease right-\nof-use assets and leasehold improvements were impaired, and recognized an impairment charge of $ 83million recorded\nas general and administrative expenses during the nine months ended September 30, 2024. The fair value of the asset\ngroups was estimated using an income-approach based on estimated future cash flows expected to be derived from the\noffice spaces based on current sublease market rent. As of September 30, 2024, the Company was continuing its\nefforts to sublease the spaces.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nThere have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies from its Annual Report on Form\n10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Issued\nIn November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2023-07,\n“Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures” (“ASU 2023-07”), which is intended\nto improve reportable segment disclosure requirements. ASU 2023-07 expands segment disclosures by requiring\ndisclosure of significant segment expenses that are regularly provided to the chief operating decision maker and\nincluded within each reported measure of segment profit or loss, an amount and description of its composition for\nother segment items, and interim disclosures of a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets.

Revenue\nDisaggregated Revenue Information\nAll revenue recognized during the periods presented was related to the Company's core business, which is primarily\ncomposed of the Company's Marketplaces and Commerce Platform.\nRevenue by geographic area is determined based on the address of the merchant, or in the case of the Company's\nmembership products, the address of the consumer. Revenue by geographic area was as follows (in millions):\nThree Months Ended September                      Nine Months Ended September\n30,                                              30,\n2023        2024                                 2023        2024\nUnited States    $                           1,953    $  2,361    $                           5,738    $  6,901\nInternational                                  211         345                                  594         948\nTotal revenue    $                           2,164    $  2,706    $                           6,332    $  7,849\nContract Liabilities\nThe timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to or collections from customers. The\nCompany’s contract liabilities balance, which is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets, is primarily composed of unredeemed gift cards, prepayments received from\nconsumers and merchants, certain consumer credits as well as other transactions for which the revenue is recognized\nover time. A summary of activities related to contract liabilities for the nine months ended September 30, 2024 was\nas follows (in millions):\n12\nTable of Contents\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n2024\nBeginning balance                          $                              308\nAddition to contract liabilities                                        1,975\nReduction of contract liabilities(1)(2)                                -1,961\nEnding balance                             $                              322\n(1) Gift cards and certain consumer credits can be redeemed through the Marketplaces. When they are redeemed,\nrevenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts\nremitted to merchants and Dashers for those transactions. Therefore, the amount recognized as revenue related to\nthe reduction of gift cards and certain consumer credits is less than the amount presented in the table above. Net\nrevenue associated with gift cards and certain consumer credits is not tracked by the Company as it is\nimpracticable to do so.\n(2) Included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities was $ 181million associated with unearned prepayments\nreceived by the Company, of which $ 163million was recognized as revenue during the nine months ended September 30,\n2024. The ending balance of unearned prepayments is expected to be recognized as revenue in 12 months or less.\nDeferred Contract Costs\nDeferred contract costs represent direct and incremental costs incurred to acquire or fulfill the Company’s\ncontracts, consisting of sales commissions and costs related to merchant onboarding, which the Company expects to\nrecover. Deferred contract costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the expected period of benefit, which\nthe Company determined by considering historical attrition rates and other factors. Deferred contract costs are\nrecorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on the condensed consolidated balance\nsheets. Amortization of deferred contract costs related to sales commissions is recognized in sales and marketing\nexpense and amortization of deferred contract costs related to merchant onboarding is recognized in cost of\nrevenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization in the condensed consolidated statements of operations.

When indicators of impairment exist or observable price changes in a same or\nsimilar security from the same issuer occur, the respective non-marketable equity security would be classified\nwithin Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy because the valuation methods include a combination of the observable\ntransaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs.\n15\nTable of Contents\nDuring the nine months ended September 30, 2023, the Company made investments in non-marketable equity securities\nof $ 19million.

Commitments and Contingencies\nLegal Proceedings\nFrom time to time, the Company may be a party to litigation and subject to claims incidental to its business.\nAlthough the results of litigation and claims cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company currently believes\nthat the final outcome of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its business. Regardless of the\noutcome, litigation can have an adverse impact on the Company because of judgment, defense and settlement costs,\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors. At each reporting period, the Company evaluates whether or\nnot a potential loss amount or a potential range of loss is probable and reasonably estimable, requiring\nrecognition of a loss accrual, or whether the potential loss is reasonably possible, requiring potential\ndisclosure. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company is currently the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and\ninquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning the Company’s business practices,\nthe classification and compensation of Dashers, the DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with consumer protection\nlaws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation insurance, and other\nmatters. For example, the Company is currently under audit by the Employment Development Department, State of\nCalifornia (the “CA EDD”) for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued an assessment for certain\namounts that it found to be owed by the Company on behalf of Dashers due to their being classified as independent\ncontractors. The Company believes that Dashers are, and have been, properly classified as independent contractors.\nAccordingly, the Company believes that it has meritorious defenses and intends to vigorously appeal such adverse\nassessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is uncertain and, accordingly, the Company has recorded\nan accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the condensed consolidated\nbalance sheets as of September 30, 2024. The results of investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries and related\ngovernmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit,\ndemand, or inquiry having a material impact on the Company's business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nIn June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of\nSan Francisco, alleging that the Company misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to\nemployees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other\nallegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar the\nCompany from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility\nthat a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\nIndemnification\nThe Company enters into standard indemnification arrangements in the ordinary course of business. Pursuant to these\narrangements, the Company agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and reimburse the indemnified parties for losses\nsuffered or incurred by the indemnified party, in connection with any trade secret, copyright, patent, or other\nintellectual property infringement claim by any third party with respect to the Company's technology. The terms of\nthese indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after the execution of the agreement.\n18\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, the Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and officers that may\nrequire the Company to indemnify its directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their\nstatus or service as directors or officers of the Company, other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct\nof the individual.\nThe maximum potential amount of future payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements is not\ndeterminable because it involves claims that may be made against the Company in the future, but have not yet been\nmade. The Company has not incurred costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification\nagreements. Noliability associated with such indemnifications was recorded as of December 31, 2023 and September\n30, 2024.\nInsurance Collateral\nThe Company is required to maintain $ 692million in collateral in connection with certain insurance policies, which\ncan be held in a combination of cash, surety bonds, and letters of credit. As of September 30, 2024, the Company\nhad $ 692million of collateral outstanding in the form of surety bonds and letters of credit in connection with the\ninsurance collateral requirement.\nRevolving Credit Facility and Letters of Credit\nIn November 2019, the Company entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement, which, as most recently\namended and restated on April 26, 2024, provides for an unsecured revolving credit facility of up to $ 800million,\nwith a letter of credit sublimit of $ 600million, maturing on April 26, 2029. Loans under the revolving credit\nfacility bear interest at the Company’s option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B)\nthe higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted\nSOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of\none, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%. The Company is also obligated to pay other customary fees\nfor a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused\ncommitment fee of 0.10%. The Company's obligations under the revolving credit facility are guaranteed by certain of\nits domestic subsidiaries meeting materiality thresholds set forth in the credit agreement. The credit agreement\ncontains customary affirmative covenants and customary negative covenants that restrict the Company's ability and\nits subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, declare cash\ndividends or make certain other distributions, repurchase stock, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell\nsubstantially all of the assets of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, make investments and loans,\nand engage in certain transactions with affiliates. The Company must also maintain compliance with a maximum senior\nnet leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the Company was in compliance with the covenants under the credit\nagreement. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, norevolving loans were outstanding under the credit\nfacility.\nIn addition to the letters of credit maintained in connection with the insurance collateral requirement, the\nCompany also maintains letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of\nDecember 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, the Company had $ 138million and $ 140million of issued letters of credit\noutstanding, respectively, of which $ 115million and $ 112million, respectively, were issued from the revolving\ncredit and guaranty agreement.\nSales and Indirect Tax Matters\nThe Company is under audit by various state, local, and foreign tax authorities with regard to sales and indirect\ntax matters. The Company records sales and indirect tax reserves as they become probable and the amount can be\nreasonably estimated. These reserves are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the\ncondensed consolidated balance sheets. The timing of the resolution of indirect tax examinations is highly\nuncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the tax authorities may\ndiffer from the amounts accrued.\n8. Common Stock\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn February 2024, the Company authorized the repurchase of its Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount of up\nto $ 1.1billion. During the three months ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 2.1million shares of its\nClass A common stock at a weighted average price of $ 105.09per share for a total amount of $ 222million. During\nthe nine\n19\nTable of Contents\nmonths ended September 30, 2024, the Company repurchased 2.1million shares of its Class A common stock at a\nweighted average price of $ 105.12per share for a total amount of $ 224million. The shares were retired immediately\nupon repurchase.\nRestricted Stock\nThe Company had granted restricted stock to certain continuing employees in connection with the acquisition of Wolt\nEnterprises Oy (\"Wolt\") on May 31, 2022. Vesting of this stock is dependent on the respective employee’s continued\nemployment at the Company during the requisite service period, which is generally up to four yearsfrom the issuance\ndate.

The CEO Performance Award vests upon the satisfaction of a service\ncondition and achievement of certain stock price goals. As of September 30, 2024, unrecognized stock-based\ncompensation expense related to the CEO Performance Award was $ 18million, which is expected to be recognized over\na period of 0.57years.\nAs of September 30, 2024, there was $ 1.8billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to\nunvested restricted stock and RSUs, excluding the unrecognized stock-based compensation expense associated with the\nCEO Performance Award. The Company expects to recognize this expense over the remaining weighted-average period of\n2.12years.\n9. Income Taxes\nThe Company’s tax provision for interim periods is determined using an estimate of its annual effective tax rate,\nadjusted for discrete items, if any, that arise during the period. Each quarter, the Company updates its estimate\nof the annual effective tax rate and, if the estimated annual effective tax rate changes, the Company makes a\ncumulative adjustment to tax expense or benefit in the period. The primary difference between the effective tax\nrate and the federal statutory tax rate is due to the valuation allowance on the Company’s deferred tax assets in\ncertain jurisdictions.\nThe Company recorded $ 6million of provision for income taxes and $ 6million of benefit from income taxes for the\nthree months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The Company recorded $ 14million and $ 2million of\nprovision\n21\nTable of Contents\nfor income taxes for the nine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024, respectively. The provision for income\ntaxes for 2023 was primarily attributable to positive pre-tax book income in the United States resulting in federal\nand state income taxes. The benefit from income taxes for the three months ended September 30, 2024, was primarily\ndriven by 2023 losses generated in non-U.S. jurisdictions for which a tax benefit can be realized.\nThe Company regularly assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets and establishes a valuation allowance\nif it is more-likely-than-not that some, or all, of its deferred tax assets will not be realized in the future. The\nCompany evaluates and weighs all available evidence, both positive and negative, including its historic operating\nresults, future reversals of existing deferred tax liabilities, as well as projected future taxable income. Changes\nin earnings performance and future earnings projections, among other factors, may cause the Company to adjust the\nvaluation allowance on deferred tax assets, which could materially impact the income tax expense in the period the\nCompany determines that these factors have changed. As of September 30, 2024, the Company maintains a full\nvaluation allowance on its deferred tax assets except for certain foreign jurisdictions.\nThe Company is subject to income tax audits in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. The Company recorded\nliabilities related to uncertain tax positions and believes that the Company has provided adequate reserves for\nincome tax uncertainties in all open tax years. To the extent the Company has tax attribute carryforwards, the tax\nyears in which the attribute was generated may still be adjusted upon examination by the federal, state, or foreign\ntax authorities to the extent utilized in a future period.\n10. Net Income (Loss) per Share Attributable to DoorDash, Inc. Common Stockholders\nThe Company computes net income (loss) per share attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders using the two-\nclass method required for multiple classes of common stock and participating securities. The rights, including the\nliquidation and dividend rights, of the Class A common stock and Class B common stock are identical, other than\nvoting rights. Accordingly, the Class A common stock and Class B common stock share equally in the Company’s net\nincome and losses. The computation of diluted net income per share of Class A common stock for the three months\nended September 30, 2024 does not assume the conversion of Class B common stock to Class A common stock because\nincluding such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect.\nThe following table sets forth the calculation of basic and diluted net income (loss) per share attributable to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders during the periods presented ( in millions, except share amounts which are\nreflected in thousands, and per share data):\nThree                                                 Nine\nMonths                                               Months\nEnded                                                Ended\nSepte…                                              Septem…\n30,                                                  30,\n2023                      2024                       2023                       2024\nClass        Class        Class        Class       Class A        Class       Class A        Class\nA            B            A            B                          B                          B\nBasic\nnet\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nNume…\nNet\ninco…\n(los…\nincl…          -70           -5          151           10          -380          -29           -21           -1\nrede…\nnon-…\ninte…\nLess:\nNet\nloss\nattr…           -2            —           -1            —            -5            —            -4            —\nto\nrede…\nnon-…\ninte…\nNet\ninco…\n(los…\nattr…\nto             -68           -5          152           10          -375          -29           -17           -1\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nDeno…\nWeig…\nnumb…\nof\nshar…\nouts…\nused\nto\ncomp…\nbasic\nnet         365,7…       27,468       386,2…       26,828       363,111       27,683       382,625       27,078\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nBasic\nnet\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare    $   -0.19    $   -0.19    $    0.39    $    0.39    $    -1.03    $   -1.03    $    -0.04    $   -0.04\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\n22\nTable of Contents\nThree                                                 Nine\nMonths                                               Months\nEnded                                                Ended\nSepte…                                              Septem…\n30,                                                  30,\n2023                      2024                       2023                       2024\nClass        Class        Class        Class       Class A        Class       Class A        Class\nA            B            A            B                          B                          B\nDilu…\nnet\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nNume…\nNet\ninco…\n(los…\nattr…\nto             -68           -5          152           10          -375          -29           -17           -1\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nDeno…\nWeig…\nnumb…\nof\nshar…\nouts…\nused\nto\ncomp…\nbasic\nnet         365,7…       27,468       386,2…       26,828       363,111       27,683       382,625       27,078\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nWeig…\neffe…\nof               —            —       14,856            —             —            —             —            —\npote…\ndilu…\nsecu…\nWeig…\nnumb…\nof\nshar…\nouts…\nused\nto\ncomp…\ndilu…\nnet         365,7…       27,468       401,1…       26,828       363,111       27,683       382,625       27,078\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nDilu…\nnet\ninco…\n(los…\nper\nshare    $   -0.19    $   -0.19    $    0.38    $    0.38    $    -1.03    $   -1.03    $    -0.04    $   -0.04\nattr…\nto\nDoor…\nInc.\ncomm…\nstoc…\nThe following outstanding shares of potentially dilutive securities were excluded from the computation of diluted\nnet income (loss) per share because including such shares would have an anti-dilutive effect, or the issuance of\nsuch shares is contingent upon the satisfaction of certain conditions which were not satisfied at the end of the\nrespective periods (in thousands):\nThree Months Ended September               Nine Months Ended September\n30,                                       30,\n2023      2024                            2023      2024\nStock options to purchase                            10,716         —                          10,716     5,704\ncommon stock\nUnvested restricted stock\nand restricted                                       40,779    11,585                          40,779    32,410\nstock units\nEscrow shares                                         2,010        72                           2,010        72\nTotal                                                53,505    11,657                          53,505    38,186\n23\nTable of Contents",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in\nconjunction with our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in\nthis Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our audited consolidated financial statements included in our Annual Report\non Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are\nbased on current plans, expectations, and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may\ndiffer materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors,\nincluding, but not limited to, those identified below and those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and\nother sections of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the\nresults that may be expected for any period in the future.\nOverview\nDoorDash, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California.

The Commerce Platform also includes\nother services including Online Ordering, which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering\nexperience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without\ninvesting in in-house engineering or fulfillment capabilities.\nFinancial and Operational Highlights\nWe use the following financial and operational metrics to help us evaluate our business, identify trends affecting\nour business, formulate business plans, and make strategic decisions:\nThree Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions, except percentages)                                         2023            2024\nTotal Orders                                                               543             643\nTotal Orders Y/Y growth                                                     24  %           18  %\nMarketplace GOV                            $                            16,751       $  20,002\nMarketplace GOV Y/Y growth                                                  24  %           19  %\nRevenue                                    $                             2,164       $   2,706\nRevenue Y/Y growth                                                          27  %           25  %\nNet Revenue Margin                                                        12.9  %         13.5  %\nGAAP gross profit                          $                               962       $   1,283\nGAAP gross profit as a % of Marketplace                                    5.7  %          6.4  %\nGOV\nContribution Profit(1)                     $                               640       $     930\nContribution Profit as a % of                                              3.8  %          4.6  %\nMarketplace GOV\nGAAP net income (loss) attributable to     $                               -73       $     162\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders\nGAAP net income (loss) attributable to\nDoorDash, Inc. common stockholders as a                                   -0.4  %          0.8  %\n% of Marketplace GOV\nAdjusted EBITDA(1)                         $                               344       $     533\nAdjusted EBITDA as a % of Marketplace                                      2.1  %          2.7  %\nGOV\nWeighted-average diluted shares                                            393             428\noutstanding\n24\nTable of Contents\n(1) Contribution Profit and Adjusted EBITDA are non-GAAP financial measures. For more information regarding our use\nof these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance\nwith GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed through our Marketplaces and Commerce Platform\nbusinesses over the period of measurement.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Total Orders increased to 643 million , or 18% growth compared to the same quarter of\n2023. The increase in Total Ord ers was d riven primarily by growth in consumers and growth in average consumer\nengagement.\nMarketplace GOV. We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplaces,\nincluding taxes, tips 1 , and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass and\nWolt+. Marketplace GOV does not include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants,\nfor orders fulfilled through Drive and Online Ordering.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Marketplace GOV increased to $20.0 billion, or 19% growth compared to the same\nquarter of 2023, driven primarily by growth in Total Orders.\nNet Revenue Margin . We define Net Revenue Margin as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Net Revenue Margin increased to 13.5% from 12.9% in the same quarter of 2023,\nprimarily due t o increasing contribution from advertising revenue and improvements to logistics quality and\nefficiency.\nContribution Profit. We define Contribution Profit as our gross profit less sales and marketing expense plus (i)\ndepreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain\npayroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, (iii) allocated overhead included\nin cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off related to restructuring. Gross\nprofit is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii)\ndepreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue.\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit is\na useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct\nexpenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Contribution Profit increased to $930 million , compared to $640 million in the same\nquarter of 2023 , driven primarily by growth in revenu e, partially offset by increases in cost of revenue.\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) attributable to DoorDash, Inc. common stockholders,\nadjusted to include net income (loss) attributable to redeemable non-controlling interests and exclude (i) certain\nlegal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment,\n(iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs),\n(iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory write-off related to restructuring, (vii)\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest income, net, (ix) other expense, net, (x) stock-based\ncompensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage\nin our business.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $533 million from $344 million in the same quarter of\n2023, driven primarily by growth in Contribution Profit.\nFree Cash Flow. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and\nequipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\nIn the third quarter of 2024, we generated net cash provided by operating activities of $531 million and Free Cash\nFlow of $444 million , up from $398 million and $324 million , respectively in the same quarter of 2023 . The\nincrease in Free Cash Flow was driven primarily by an increase in net cash provided by operating activities.\n1 Dashers receive 100% of tips\n25\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe

majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplaces and the related\ncommissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are\nbased on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our\nMarketplaces to sell the partner merchants’ products.

Foreign\njurisdictions have different statutory tax rates than those in the United States. Additionally, certain of our\nforeign earnings may also be taxable in the United States.\nAccordingly, our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including\nvariability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, changes\nin our stock price, intercompany transactions, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, tax audit\ndevelopments, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains and\nlosses, changes in statutes, regulations, case law, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations\nrelated to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in\nvarious jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized.\nAdditionally, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses varies depending on the amount of pre-tax\nincome or loss. For example, the impact of any particular item is greater when the amount of our pre-tax income or\nloss is smaller.\nWe have a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets in the United States and Finland. We expect to\nmaintain these valuation allowances until it becomes more-likely-than-not that the benefit of our deferred tax\nassets will be realized by way of expected future taxable income in the United States and Finland.\nThree Months                                      Nine Months\n(in millions,        Ended September                                  Ended September\nexcept                           30,                                              30,\npercentages)                    2023       2024    % Change                      2023       2024    % Change\nProvision for\n(benefit from)    $                6    $    -6              *    $                14    $     2              *\nincome\ntaxes\n*Percentage not meaningful\nThe benefit from income taxes for the third quarter of 2024 was primarily driven by losses generated in non-U.S.\njurisdictions for which a tax benefit can be realized.

We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to\ninvestors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance\nand future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their\nfinancial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors\nin seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these\nnon-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of\nour business over multiple periods and with other companies in our industry.\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited.\nIn addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain\nlimitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our condensed\nconsolidated statements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense,\nadjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit,\nContribution Margin, Adjusted\n31\nTable of Contents\nGross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not\nas substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and\nmarketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense,\nContribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free\nCash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our\nbusiness, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial\nmeasure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and\ndevelopment expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin,\nAdjusted Gross Profit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with their\nrespective related GAAP financial measures.\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-\nbased compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, allocated overhead, and inventory write-off related to\nrestructuring.

These excluded\ncosts and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, our\nhistorical Dasher pay model, and a settlement entered into in connection with an initiative to serve\nunderrepresented communities, (ii) reserves and settlements or other resolutions for or related to the collection\nof sales, indirect, and other taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) expenses related to\nsupporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification, other labor law matters, and\nprice controls, and (iv) donations as part of our relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We\nbelieve it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of adjusted general and\nadministrative expense because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of\nmanagement’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management\ncurrently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of\nincreasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California\nand similar legislation.\nContribution Profit\nWe use Contribution Profit to evaluate our operating performance and trends.

These excluded costs and expenses consist\nof (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, our historical Dasher pay model, and\na settlement entered into in connection with an initiative to serve underrepresented communities, (ii) reserves and\nsettlements or other resolutions for or related to the collection of sales, indirect, and other taxes that we do\nnot expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including\nthose related to worker classification, other labor law matters, and price controls, and (iv) donations as part of\nour relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing\nmatters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are\nunpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker\nclassification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of\noperations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area,\nincluding as a result of Proposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and\ncapitalized software and website development costs.\n35\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)                                                          2023        2024\nNet cash provided by operating           $                            1,188    $  1,614\nactivities\nPurchases of property and equipment                                     -94         -72\nCapitalized software and website                                       -143        -160\ndevelopment costs\nFree Cash Flow                           $                              951    $  1,382\nNet cash used in investing activities    $                             -223    $   -281\nNet cash used in financing activities    $                             -702    $   -211\nCredit Facility\nOn November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with certain lenders, which, as\nmost recently amended and restated on April 26, 2024, provides for an $800 million unsecured revolving credit\nfacility maturing on April 26, 2029, with a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face\namount of up to $600 million. As of September 30, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants under the\nrevolving credit and guaranty agreement. As amended and restated, the credit agreement contains customary\naffirmative covenants, as well as customary negative covenants that restrict our ability and our subsidiaries’\nability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, declare cash dividends or make certain\nother distributions, repurchase stock, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our\nand our subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole, make investments and loans, and engage in certain transactions with\naffiliates. The Company must also maintain compliance with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly,\ndetermined in accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. As of December 31, 2023 and September 30, 2024, no\nrevolving loans were outstanding and $115 million and $112 million of letters of credit were issued under our\nrevolving credit facility, respectively.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of September 30, 2024, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $5.8 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $3.7 billion, short-term marketable securities of\n$1.3 billion, and long-term marketable securities of $795 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors\nof $335 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and\nconsumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted\nof cash on deposit with banks, as well as institutional money market funds, commercial paper, certificates of\ndeposit and U.S. Treasury securities. Marketable securities consisted of certificates of deposit, commercial paper,\ncorporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, U.S. Treasury securities, and mutual funds.\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $5.4\nbillion as of September 30, 2024. We have historically funded our operations from cash from operations as well as\nthe issuance of equity securities, including in our initial public offering in December 2020. To execute on our\nstrategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and generate negative cash\nflows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources. We believe our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with the available borrowings under our revolving\ncredit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the\nnext 12 months and beyond.\nIn February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $1.1 billion. Repurchases may be made from time to time through\nopen market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal\nrequirements, and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the\nrequirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to\nfacilitate repurchases of our Class A common stock under this authorization. The timing and actual number of shares\nrepurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and\nalternative investment opportunities. As of September 30, 2024, approximately $876 million remained available under\nthe repurchase authorization.\n36\nTable of Contents\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability\nto attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance\nof our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the\nexpansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification\ninitiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, products,\nservices, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\nNine Months Ended September 30,\n(in millions)                                                            2023        2024\nNet cash provided by operating             $                            1,188    $  1,614\nactivities\nNet cash used in investing activities                                    -223        -281\nNet cash used in financing activities                                    -702        -211\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash                                     -16           4\nequivalents, and restricted cash\nNet increase in cash, cash equivalents,    $                              247    $  1,126\nand restricted cash\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for the first nine months of 2024 .

          "content": "Item 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nWe are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest\nrates and foreign exchange risks.\nInterest Rate Fluctuation Risk\nOur investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade\ndebt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently,\nare recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax\nreported as a separate component of stockholders’ equity within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our\ninvestment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity\nrequirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of September 30, 2024, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in\ninterest rates would not have materially affected our condensed consolidated financial statements. We currently do\nnot hedge these interest rate exposures.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes\nother than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these\nsecurities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the\nearly stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies. However,\nwe believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $40 million as of September 30, 2024.\nAdjustments or impairments are recorded in other expense, net on the condensed consolidated statements of\noperations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Risk\nTransaction Exposure\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies,\nprimarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel, and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported\nincome and loss from our international businesses included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\nA continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our\ninternational businesses included in our condensed consolidated statements of operations.\n38\nTable of Contents\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income or loss as a result of\ntransaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that\nare denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded.\nForeign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2024. Based on\nour foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities as of September 30, 2024, we estimated that a\n10% change in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\nTranslation Exposure\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign\nsubsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation. If there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates, the\ntranslation adjustments resulting from the conversion of the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into\nU.S. dollars would result in a gain or loss recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income\n(loss) which is part of stockholders’ equity.",

Based on such evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal\nfinancial officer have concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a\nreasonable assurance level.\nChanges in Internal Control\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended September 30, 2024\nthat have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, do not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.\n39\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Item 1. Legal Proceedings\nWe are currently involved in, and may in the future be involved in, legal proceedings, claims, regulatory\ninquiries, audits, and governmental investigations (collectively, “Legal Proceedings”) in the ordinary course of\nbusiness, including suits by merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other third parties (individually or as class\nactions).\nThe outcomes of our Legal Proceedings are inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. When\nwe determine that we have meritorious defenses to any claims asserted, we defend ourselves vigorously; however, we\nalso consider settlement of disputes when, in management’s judgment, it is in the best interests of both DoorDash\nand its shareholders to do so. For some matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of\nthe amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that\ncould potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal\nProceedings, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded or non-monetary damages.\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material\nadministrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial\nposition or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.\nIndependent contractor classification matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration\nproceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the\nfederal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent\ncontractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that\nwould apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent\ncontractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create\nuncertainty and unpredictability for us.\nWe are currently involved in putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought under California\nLabor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and\nother matters challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. Various other\nDashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our\nplatform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law, seeking monetary,\ninjunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual Dashers,\nwith many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our independent\ncontractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney\nfiled an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified\nCalifornia Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and\nthe California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages\nand a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent\ncontractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is\nnot estimable given the status of the case.\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us\nbecause of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and\nother factors.\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform\ncan continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. New laws and regulations and changes to\nexisting laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and\nrelated technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed California Assembly Bill 5 (\"AB 5\"), which was\nsigned into law in September 2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the standard in the\nCalifornia Supreme Court's 2018 ruling in Dynamex Operations West, Inc. v Superior Court (\"Dynamex\") regarding\ncontractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other\ncompanies, supported a campaign for Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers,\nwhich was approved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, in February 2021,\npetitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda\nCounty Superior Court to compel the State of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as\nunconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding\nthat the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based\nDrivers and Services coalition, and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 filed\n40\nTable of Contents\nappeals in the California First District Court of Appeal. In March 2023, the Court of Appeal overturned the Alameda\nCounty Superior Court's ruling and upheld nearly all of Proposition 22 as state law. In April 2023, petitioners\nconsisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a petition for review in the Supreme Court of\nCalifornia, which was granted in June 2023. In July 2024, the Supreme Court of California upheld the Court of\nAppeal's March 2023 ruling, leaving nearly all of Proposition 22 in place as state law.\nConsumer protection and other actions\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the\nordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities,\nalleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws, and other laws. In\naddition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and\nour former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nIntellectual property matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged\ninfringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive\ncorrespondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such\nproperty or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend\nourselves vigorously in these matters.\nRegulatory and administrative investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative\ninvestigations, audits, demands, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies\nconcerning our business practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models,\ncompliance with consumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’\ncompensation insurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development\nDepartment of the State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD\nissued a negative assessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the CA\nEDD’s assessment, and intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. However, the ultimate resolution of the audit is\nuncertain and, accordingly, we have recorded an accrual for this matter within accrued expenses and other current\nliabilities on the condensed consolidated balance sheets as of September 30, 2024. We are currently the subject of\ngovernment investigations, audits, demands, and inquiries in other jurisdictions as well, and we may in the future\nsettle, or record accruals with respect to, such matters. Further, the results of investigations, audits, demands,\nand inquiries and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk\nof an investigation, audit, demand, or inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or\nunfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse\nimpact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the\ndiversion of management resources, and other factors.\nPersonal injury matters\nWe have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various\nparties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have\nbeen active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or\nother incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have\nmeritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no\npending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our\nopinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations;\nhowever, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such\naccidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense\nand settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n41\nTable of Contents",

          "content": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A\ncommon stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks\nand uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely\naffected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part\nof your investment.\nRisk Factors Summary\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could\ncause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nconsistently maintain or increase profitability in the future;\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected;\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to adequately\nmaintain their service levels or materially increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business\ncould be adversely affected;\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or\nplatform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful;\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws\nof other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected;\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result;\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations;\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting\nAgreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (our \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating\nvoting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\n42\nTable of Contents\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval; and\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nWe have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future\nprospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services, expanded\ninto new categories, changed our pricing methodologies, and entered new geographies. This limited operating history\nand our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may\nencounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:\naccurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\nincrease the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\nsuccessfully compete with current and future competitors;\nsuccessfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\nsuccessfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own;\nanticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate, including with\nrespect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline and food costs;\nmaintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\nadapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\navoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\ndevelop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably\nhandle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\nhire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\neffectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations;\neffectively adapt to and manage the regulatory environment and new laws related to our business; and\neffectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges\nlisted above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have relatively limited\nhistorical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of\noperations may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more\npredictable market. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations\ncould differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to\nconsistently maintain or increase profitability in the future.\nWhile we have achieved net income in the three months ended September 30, 2024, we have incurred net losses in each\nyear since our founding. We anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to consistently\nmaintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $404 million and $18 million in the\nnine months ended September 30, 2023 and 2024 , respectively, and as of September 30, 2024 , we had an accumulated\ndeficit of $5.4 billion. We expect our costs will increase over time and, to the extent that we are unable to earn\nsufficient revenue to offset such costs, we may incur losses in certain future periods, as we expect to invest\nsignificant additional funds towards growing our business. We have expended and expect to continue to expend\nsubstantial financial and other resources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings,\ndeveloping or acquiring new platform features and services, acquiring and integrating technologies and businesses,\nexpanding into new markets and categories, and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be\nmore costly than we expect and may not result in\n43\nTable of Contents\nsufficient increased revenue or growth in our business to offset such costs. Any failure to increase our revenue\nsufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from consistently maintaining or\nincreasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address\nthese risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other\noutstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of September 30, 2024, we had\n$1.8 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards.\nOur business may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\nOur business has grown rapidly during various periods since our founding. Our past revenue growth rate, growth in\ndemand for our offerings, and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future\nperformance. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period\nas any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business metrics growth in future\nperiods.\nIn particular, our revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the\nshort term and decline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market\nadoption. We may also experience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform,\ninsufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing\ncompetition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, or\nincreasing regulatory costs. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our\nbusiness, which may not result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost of such investments. If our\nrevenue growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common\nstock could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences,\nfragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery\nlogistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we\ncompete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway, and Delivery Hero,\nmerchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online ordering systems, merchants that own and operate\ntheir own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, convenience stores and convenience store delivery\nservices, and companies that provide merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food,\nwe may compete with additional businesses with substantial resources, users, and market and brand power, including\nlarge e-commerce companies, large retailers, and large grocery store chains. In addition, we compete with\ntraditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants\ndistribute to consumers. Further, as we continue to expand our presence internationally, we also face competition\nfrom local incumbents in these markets.\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages such as greater name recognition, longer\noperating histories, market-specific knowledge, established relationships with local merchants and suppliers,\nlarger existing user bases, more successful marketing capabilities, established geographic footprints and\ninfrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. For example, with\ngrocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains that have strong bargaining power, established\nrelationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater financial resources and product development\ncapabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies\nand changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less attractive or obsolete.\nIf certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose\nto engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of merchant options or lack\naccess to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing to consumers. Our\ncompetitors have in the past, and may in the future, also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other\nstrategic relationships among themselves or with others, including by integrating their services or membership\nproducts with the offerings of another company that provides expanded distribution. Our competitors could also\nintroduce new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive\nmarketing campaigns than ours. Such efforts may lead us to lose category share or require us to increase our\nmarketing expenses in order to maintain our category share.\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and may offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and\nconsumer fees, greater incentives for merchants joining their platforms and independent contractors who provide\ndelivery services, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay\nmodels, any of\n44\nTable of Contents\nwhich may be more attractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures have led us, and may lead us in\nthe future, to change our commission rates and fees or change our incentives, discounts, and promotions to remain\ncompetitive. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will likely continue to negatively affect, our financial\nperformance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the markets in which we\ncompete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of\nour competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the other competitive\nadvantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees, or increase the\nincentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Local on-demand delivery\nservices for food and the other areas in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will\nstabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to maintain or increase profitability. Further, merchants\ncould determine that it is in their best interests to develop their own platforms to offer online pickup and\ndelivery rather than use our platform.\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift based on\ncost, quality, and selection and could use more than one local commerce platform; independent contractors who\nprovide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings; and\nmerchants could prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more\nthan one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as\nexisting offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain\nof our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than\nours, which would make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate.\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or\nDashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce\nour commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-\neffective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to cost-effectively grow our\nplatform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in new\nmarkets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers attracts\nmore merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has grown in\nthe past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our\nnational brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to incur\nsubstantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to\nacquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may\ninvest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for\nseveral years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will\nultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial\ndistress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may\nnot be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with\nrestaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have\nfewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants\nenter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants,\nor if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until\nterminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by\nproviding us at least 7 or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any exclusivity.\nIn the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection available on our\nlocal commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our relationships with some of\nour constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other constituencies. For example, the\nincreased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how compelling these offerings are to\nconsumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership products. Additionally, many of\nour consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and other\nreduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such consumers, thereby\nencouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our membership products, through prompts\nand notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other offerings. However, these consumers\nmay never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our platform after they take\n45\nTable of Contents\nadvantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our consumers to regular\npaying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform, demand for our full-price\nor paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or decline.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing\nDashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our\nscreening criteria and procedures and to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the\nability to decline offers or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity\nprovisions with Dashers. Accordingly, if we do not continue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform and\ncompelling opportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers or retain existing Dashers or increase\ntheir use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or work stoppages that could\nadversely affect our users and our business. Relatedly, if merchants and/or consumers choose to use competing\nofferings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our\nplatform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain Dashers, we have, among other\nthings, invested in making the use of our Dasher applications, and dashing, as frictionless as possible, created\nnew ways for Dashers to earn and get paid, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, including credits to be\nused to place orders on our platform, provided assistance using the Dasher applications, and offered access to\nprograms that provide cashback rewards on certain purchases, including gasoline. We also frequently test Dasher\nincentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and\nretain Dashers or fail to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have unintended adverse\nconsequences, including negative press, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our\nbrand and reputation in both the United States and other geographies. Changes in certain laws and regulations,\nincluding immigration and labor and employment laws, or laws that require us to make changes to our platform that\ndecrease the flexibility provided to Dashers in certain markets, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers,\nwhich may result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors\noutside of our control, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the\nnumber of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. If we fail to attract Dashers,\nretain existing Dashers on favorable terms, or maintain or increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, we\nmay not be able to meet the demands of merchants and consumers and our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to adequately\nmaintain their service levels or materially increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business\ncould be adversely affected.\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these\nmerchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods, meeting our requirements and\nstandards, or price their goods on our platform at unreasonable rates, our reputation and brand could be damaged.\nAn increase in merchant operating costs, whether due to inflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our\nplatform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect\nour revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. Further, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices\nrelative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and\ncould result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis,\nwhich may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of\noperations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of\nfactors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-\nperiod basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors”\nsection, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\nour ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective\nmanner;\nour ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\nthe effects of increased competition on our business;\nour ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\n46\nTable of Contents\nour ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses;\nchanges in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\nincreases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers;\nthe mix among various aspects of our business, including our Marketplaces and Commerce Platform, our U.S. and\nnon-U.S. operations, our restaurant and non-restaurant categories, and contributions to our overall business by new\nproducts and services, such as our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and our advertising products;\nthe impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand\ndelivery;\nthe impact of weather and seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college\ncampuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\nour ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\nour ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\nthe effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\nour ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\nthe success of our sales and marketing efforts;\nthe effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\nour ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\ncosts associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related\njudgments or settlements;\nchanges in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the\nclassification of Dashers that utilize our platform, regulations governing the rates that we pay Dashers that\nutilize our platform and other conditions of their work, and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge\nto merchants;\ninterruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\nthe effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\nthe effects of outbreaks of contagious disease and the response of governments and private industry;\nthe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\nthe impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\nchanges in the online payment transfer rate; and\nchanges in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our\nexpectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations\nfor a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common\nstock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times.\nOur systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or\nother performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service\nand other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, other natural\ndisasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts,\nterrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to\nbreak-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become\nincreasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of\nour platform, especially during peak usage times, as our\n47\nTable of Contents\noperations grow and the usage of our platform increases. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our\ndisaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not\nbe sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems\nfailures and similar events.\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions that\ninterrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These events have\nresulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of revenue and may\nharm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to consumers on our\nplatform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event, including for orders\nthat are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may voluntarily provide similar\ncredits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse from us for their losses and such\nclaims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, we may not be\nable to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged\ninterruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform\ncould adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business,\nour business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets\nand arrangements that complement our business. We have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to\nevaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent markets and there is no assurance that such acquired\nbusinesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we enter into, will be successfully integrated into our\nbusiness, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits on a timely basis or at all.\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and\nnegatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\nintense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and\nadversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\ntransaction-related lawsuits or claims;\ndifficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\ndifficulties integrating the technologies and operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts,\nand personnel of an acquired business;\ndifficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business,\nand difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\ndifficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\nchallenges integrating internal controls, procedures, and policies and accounting, finance, and forecasting\npractices of acquired businesses with our own, especially in the context of international businesses;\nchallenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense\nsharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership\ninvestments;\nchallenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\ndifficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones,\nlanguages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\ncurrency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with foreign jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\ndiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment\nopportunities;\nfailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\nfailure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an investment or acquired\nbusiness, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices,\nlitigation, information security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand management, revenue recognition\nor other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\n48\nTable of Contents\nthe enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our\nability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\nregulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions\n(such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the\ncompletion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\nan acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our\nexisting business;\nadditional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction,\nwhich may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\nas a result of an acquisition, third parties we or an acquired business works with may delay or defer certain\nbusiness decisions, seek to terminate, change, or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired business,\nor consider working with a competitor instead; and\nadverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our\nresults of operations, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or\nif the transaction costs are greater than expected.\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. Strategic investments\ninherently involve less control over business operations of the investee, thereby potentially increasing the\nfinancial, legal, operational, regulatory, or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic\ninvestment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or\nentities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or\ncompetitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders,\nmanagement, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result\nin litigation or regulatory action against us, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to\nsell or transfer, or realize value from our investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and\nregulations. Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities now or in the future may be subject to\ngovernment regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or foreign government\nentities. If a transaction with a foreign entity is subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might\nlimit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term\nbusiness strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments will generate returns for our\nbusiness, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, during the quarters\nended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2023, we recorded impairments of $312 million and $101 million,\nrespectively, associated with non-marketable equity securities that we acquired in connection with strategic\ninvestments.\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future\nacquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets,\narrangements, and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such\nacquisitions or investments, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks\nand our plans may not be successful.\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S.\nmarkets as part of our growth strategy. We currently operate in over 30 countries across the globe. Our operations\noutside of the United States require significant operating expenses and management attention in order to oversee\noperations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural norms, and customs, in addition to\nplacing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Our international\noperations and our plans for investment in non-U.S. markets subject us to a number of risks and we may not be\nsuccessful in our international operations for a variety of reasons, including:\nan inability to recruit and retain talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintain our company\nculture across all of our offices;\nan inability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\ncompetition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more\neffectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\ndiffering demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\n49\nTable of Contents\ndifficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, consumers, and Dashers in non-U.S.\nmarkets;\ndifficulty complying with varying laws and regulatory standards across jurisdictions, including with respect to\nlabor and employment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export control and sanctions, public health, payment\nprocessing, transactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\nincreased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue\nrecognition and similar accounting principles;\ndifficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and\ncustoms, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it\nrelates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\nadverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax laws, and\nrestrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\nunique and varying terms and conditions and cultural norms in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\nvarying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\nobtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\nvarying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\nforeign currency exchange restrictions or costs;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same\nextent as the United States;\npublic health concerns or emergencies, which have occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in\nwhich we operate or may operate in the future; and\nlimitations and differences in available instruments to invest our funds, including the risk profile associated\nwith such investments, and limitations on our ability to repatriate funds.\nChallenges with operating and growing our business internationally increase the risk that any potential future\nexpansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to\nexpand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject\nour business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security\nrisks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards,\nincluding with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions such as\nU.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, the\noperations of our wholly owned subsidiary, Wolt Enterprises Oy (\"Wolt\"), in markets that are in close proximity to\nRussia increase the difficulty in complying with trade and economic sanction regimes related to business with\nRussia.\nOur pricing methodologies are impacted by a number of factors, and we may not ultimately be successful in\nattracting and retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nDemand for our platform is highly sensitive to a range of factors, including the price of the goods delivered, the\namount of compensation and gratuities required to attract and retain Dashers, incentives paid to Dashers, and the\nfees and commissions we charge merchants and consumers. Many factors, including operating costs, legal and\nregulatory requirements, constraints or changes, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing\nstrategies, could significantly affect our pricing strategies. For example, some jurisdictions in which we operate\nhave introduced price control measures on local commerce platforms and established minimum earnings standards for\ncertain delivery workers, including Dashers, and we expect other such measures may be enacted in the future. These\nprice control measures, minimum earnings standards, and similar regulations have caused, and may in the future\ncause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers. Our risks related to these regulations are described in more\ndetail under the section titled “— Our business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including\nthose related to worker classification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and\nconsumer fees and taxes, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to\nlegal claims, increased costs, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, or results of operations .”\nCertain of our competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or a broader range of offerings.\nSimilarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to attract and retain new merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers\n50\nTable of Contents\nat a lower cost than us. There is no assurance that we will not be forced, through competition, regulation, or\notherwise, to reduce the price of delivery for consumers, increase the incentives we pay to Dashers that utilize\nour platform, further reduce the fees and commissions we charge merchants, or increase our marketing and other\nexpenses to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers in response to competitive pressures. We have\nlaunched, and may in the future launch, new pricing strategies and initiatives, including Dasher or consumer\nloyalty programs, such as our membership products like DashPass and Wolt+, or modify existing pricing methodologies\nor the way in which fees, taxes, or similar items are presented on our platform, any of which may not ultimately be\nsuccessful in attracting and retaining merchants, consumers, or Dashers and which may result in lower commissions\nor fees, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, our\nconsumers’ price sensitivity may vary by geographic location, and as we expand, our business model and pricing\nmethodologies may not be competitive in these locations. As a result, our continued international expansion may\nrequire us to change our operations and pricing strategies to adjust to different cultural norms, including with\nrespect to consumer pricing and gratuities.\nOur assessments about optimal pricing strategy may not be accurate and may not enable us to compete in the\ncategories and regions in which we operate effectively. There may also be errors or defects in the technology we\nuse to set our prices, which could result in underpricing or overpricing our services. In addition, as the products\nand services on our platform change, we may need to revise our pricing methodologies. Any such pricing assumptions,\ntechnological errors or defects in pricing, or changes to our pricing methodology could adversely affect demand for\nour platform, our brand and reputation, and results of operations.\nWe face certain risks associated with our pay models for Dashers.\nOur pay models for Dashers have previously led, and may continue to lead, to negative publicity, lawsuits,\narbitration demands, and government inquiries. For example, under a former pay model for Dashers in the United\nStates, we would increase the amount paid to Dashers on a delivery in cases when a consumer left little or no tip.\nAlthough this additional pay was intended to help Dashers by making every delivery economically worthwhile, it also\nhad the effect of causing some people to be under the misimpression that not all tips were being received by\nDashers. Government authorities have brought claims against us related to our former DoorDash Dasher pay model and\nmay bring similar claims in the future.\nWe have also launched, and may in the future launch, changes to the rates and fee structures for Dashers that\nutilize our platform, which may not ultimately be successful in attracting and retaining Dashers and may result in\nnegative publicity or damage our reputation. Changes to our pay models have resulted in, and in the future may\nresult in, negative publicity related to perceptions of its complexity, inconsistency in earnings for Dashers, and\nlack of flexibility in the ways consumers can leave tips, any of which may negatively impact our ability to attract\nand retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, we increased the amount we paid to DoorDash Dashers per\norder when we changed our pay model in September 2019, but this also caused less consistency in earnings across\ndeliveries in some cases. In addition, in June 2023, we announced an option for Dashers in most cities to earn a\nguaranteed hourly rate while delivering. In the future, based on a variety of factors, including legal and\nregulatory changes and expansion into new categories and geographies, we may change our Dasher pay models again. In\nparticular, new or amended laws and regulations have required, and could in the future require, us to make changes\nto our Dasher pay models, or make other changes to our platform, that decrease the flexibility provided to Dashers\nin certain markets, which may also impact our ability to cost-effectively attract or retain Dashers. Our current\nDasher pay models, any changes made in response to new laws and regulations, and any future changes to our pay\nmodels or our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers, could result in an increase to the fees we\ncharge to consumers, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain consumers, and could adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFurther, while we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform remain independent contractors, there is a risk\nthat Dashers may be reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law or the laws of other jurisdictions in\nwhich we operate. As discussed further elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, we have been involved in\nand continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification in the United States,\nincluding an action brought by the San Francisco District Attorney in June 2020. Certain risks related to\nreclassification of Dashers that use our platform are described in more detail under the section titled “ —If\nDashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected .” A reclassification of Dashers as employees could require us to revise our pricing\nmethodologies and Dasher pay models to account for such a change to Dasher classification, and to make other\ninternal adjustments to account for any transition of a subset of Dashers to employment positions, which would have\nan adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n51\nTable of Contents\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nSince 2013, we have experienced rapid growth in our employee headcount, the number of users on our platform, our\ngeographic reach, and our operations, and we expect to continue to experience growth in the future. We have\nexperienced rapid employee headcount growth at our San Francisco headquarters, in a number of our offices across\nthe United States, internationally, and with employees working remotely globally. We have also expanded our\npresence, both in employee headcount and operationally, in Europe and Asia through our acquisition of Wolt. This\ngrowth has placed, and may continue to place, substantial demands on management and our operational and financial\ninfrastructure.\nWe will need to continue to improve our operational and financial infrastructure, including the development of\nappropriate controls, in order to manage our business effectively and accurately report our results of operations.\nSimilarly, our failure to implement and maintain effective data and information security systems with respect to\nour platform as we grow could result in breaches, security incidents, theft or fraud, service disruptions, loss of\nuser confidence in our platform, legal claims, regulatory investigations, and damage to our reputation or brand,\nany of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have made, and intend to continue to make, substantial investments in our technology, customer service, and\nsales and marketing infrastructure. Our ability to manage our growth effectively and to integrate new employees,\ntechnologies, services, and acquisitions into our existing business will require us to continue to expand our\noperational and financial infrastructure and to continue to effectively integrate, develop, and motivate a large\nnumber of new employees, while maintaining the beneficial aspects of our culture. Continued growth could challenge\nour ability to develop and improve our operational, financial, and management controls, enhance our reporting\nsystems and procedures, recruit, train, and retain highly skilled personnel, and maintain user satisfaction.\nAdditionally, if we do not manage the growth of our business and operations effectively, the quality of our\nplatform and the efficiency of our operations could suffer, which could adversely affect our reputation and brand,\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGrowth of our business will depend on a strong reputation and brand, and any failure to maintain, protect, and\nenhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our\nability to increase their level of engagement.\nWe believe that building a strong reputation and brand and continuing to increase the strength of the local network\neffects among the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that use our platform are critical to our ability to attract\nand retain all three constituencies and increase their engagement with our platform. Similarly, maintaining and\nenhancing the Wolt reputation and brand will be particularly important for our continued growth in Europe and Asia.\nSuccessfully maintaining, protecting, and enhancing our reputation and brand and increasing the local network\neffects of our platform will depend on the success of our marketing efforts, our ability to provide consistent,\nhigh-quality services and support, and our ability to successfully secure, maintain, and defend our rights to use\nthe “DoorDash” and \"Wolt\" marks, our logos, and other trademarks important to our brand, as well as a number of\nother factors, many of which are outside our control. We believe that our paid marketing initiatives have been\ncritical in promoting awareness of our platform, which in turn drives new user growth and engagement, but future\nmarketing efforts may not be successful or cost-effective. Our users have a wide variety of options for delivery of\ngoods, including other local commerce platforms and services, and consumer preferences may also change. To expand\nour user base, we must appeal to new users who may have historically used other methods of delivering goods or\nother local commerce platforms.\nOur reputation, brand, and ability to build trust with merchants, consumers, and Dashers may be adversely affected\nby complaints and negative publicity about us, our platform, merchants, and Dashers that utilize our platform or\nour competitors’ platforms, even if factually incorrect or based on isolated incidents. The effect of negative\npublicity could be exacerbated to the extent dissatisfaction with, or complaints concerning, us are disseminated\nvia social media platforms. Any such expressions of dissatisfaction or complaints, even if ultimately concluded to\nbe unfounded or successfully resolved without direct adverse financial effects, could still harm our brand,\nreputation, and local network effects. Negative perception of our platform or company may result from:\ncomplaints or negative publicity about us, our platform, services or items provided through our platform,\nincluding highly regulated products, Dashers, merchants, consumers, or our policies and guidelines, including\nDasher pay;\nmissing or incorrect items, inaccurate orders, or cancelled orders;\nillegal, negligent, reckless, or otherwise inappropriate behavior by users or third parties;\nfood tampering or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery;\n52\nTable of Contents\ntraffic accidents caused by, or involving, Dashers or employee couriers or death or serious injury involving a\nDasher or employee couriers or any party associated with us;\na pandemic or an outbreak of disease, in which constituencies of our network become infected;\na failure to provide Dashers with a sufficient number of offers or otherwise pay Dashers competitively;\na failure to offer consumers competitive pricing and delivery times;\na failure to provide a range of delivery options sought by consumers;\na failure to provide environmentally friendly delivery and packaging options;\nactual or perceived disruptions to or defects in our platform or similar incidents, such as privacy or data\nsecurity breaches or other security incidents, site outages, payment disruptions, or other incidents that impact\nthe reliability of our services;\nlitigation over, or investigations by regulators into, our platform;\nchanges to our policies that users or others perceive as overly restrictive, unclear, or inconsistent with our\nvalues or mission;\na failure to comply with legal, tax, privacy, and regulatory requirements, including violations of food\ninformation and alcohol delivery age verification regulations;\nchanges to our practices with respect to collection and use of merchant, consumer, and Dasher data;\na failure to enforce our policies in a manner that users perceive as effective, fair, and transparent;\na failure to operate our business in a way that is consistent with our values and mission;\ninadequate or unsatisfactory user support experiences;\nillegal or otherwise inappropriate behavior by our management team or other employees or contractors;\nnegative responses by merchants, consumers, or Dashers to new services on our platform;\na failure to register and prevent misappropriation of our trademarks;\nperception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers and our response to employee,\nmerchant, consumer, and Dasher sentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management;\nour operations in regions that are or become subject to geopolitical instability, conflict, or economic\nsanctions, and any negative consequences of such operations to us, our merchants, consumers, or Dashers; or\nany of the foregoing with respect to our competitors, to the extent such resulting negative perception affects\nthe public’s perception of us or our industry as a whole.\nIf we do not successfully develop, protect, and enhance our reputation and brand and increase the local network\neffects of our platform, our business may not grow, and we may not be able to compete effectively. If existing and\nnew merchants and consumers do not perceive the delivery services provided by Dashers that utilize our platform to\nbe reliable, safe, and affordable, or if we fail to offer new and relevant services and features on our platform,\nwe may not be able to attract or retain merchants, consumers, or Dashers or to increase their use of our platform,\nany of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable media coverage could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnfavorable publicity regarding our business model, Dasher pay models, user support, technology, platform policies,\nplatform changes, platform or other quality issues, delivery issues, privacy or security practices, management\nteam, compliance with laws and regulations, or the health and safety of Dashers, employee couriers, merchants, and\nconsumers using our platform could adversely affect our reputation. Such negative publicity could also harm the\nsize of our network and the engagement and loyalty of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform,\nwhich could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. For example, we have\npreviously received negative media coverage related to the manner in which Dashers were compensated, in particular\nwith respect to gratuities, concerns related to food tampering and general food safety and quality, and concerns\nregarding the safety of Dashers, consumers, and merchants using our platform, which has adversely affected our\nreputation and brand from time to time. In addition, negative publicity related to key brands, influencers, or\nother third parties that we have partnered with or may partner with in the future may damage our reputation, even\nif the publicity is not directly related to us. Any negative\n53\nTable of Contents\npublicity that we may receive could diminish confidence in, and the use of, our platform, which could adversely\naffect our business.\nWe have been subject to cybersecurity incidents in the past and anticipate being the target of future attacks. Any\nactual or perceived cybersecurity incident or security or privacy breach could interrupt our operations, harm our\nbrand, subject us to claims, litigation, regulatory investigations and liability, and adversely affect our\nreputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business involves the collection, storage, transmission, and other processing of personal data and other\nsensitive and proprietary data of our merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Additionally, we maintain sensitive and\nproprietary data relating to our business, including our own proprietary data and personal data relating to our\nemployees. Cybersecurity incidents are increasing in severity and sophistication and can originate with external\nactors or with our employees and contractors, whether acting maliciously or by inadvertently providing access to an\nexternal party or having their credentials compromised by an external party. Further, due to the current\ngeopolitical environment, there is heightened risk of cybersecurity incidents sponsored by state actors or state-\naffiliated actors, which could target businesses. These incidents can originate on our vendors’ systems, which can\nbe leveraged to access our websites, platforms, and data, including personal data. We and our vendors have\npreviously experienced these types of breaches and other incidents. For example, in August 2022, we reported an\nincident affecting one of our vendors that resulted in unauthorized access to personal data of certain consumers\nand Dashers. We have undertaken steps to enhance our data security and governance program, which include adding\nsecurity layers around data, improving access controls, hiring additional personnel with data security experience,\nand using outside expertise to identify and repel threats. We cannot assure you that all potential causes of these\nincidents have been identified and remediated or will not lead to recurrence or other incidents.\nBecause techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or to sabotage or exfiltrate data from information systems\nchange frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our vendors, we and our vendors may be unable\nto anticipate or prevent these attacks, react in a timely manner, or implement adequate detective or preventive\nmeasures, and we and our vendors may face delays in our response to or remediation of breaches and other incidents.\nUnauthorized parties have in the past gained access, and may in the future gain access, to systems used in our\nbusiness through various means. In addition, there may be attempts to fraudulently induce our employees, merchants,\nconsumers, Dashers, vendors, or others into disclosing user names, passwords, payment card information, or other\nsensitive information resulting in account takeovers or the fraudulent transfer of funds to bad actors. With the\nprevalence of remote work, we may also be exposed to increased risks of breaches or incidents via such methods.\nAlthough we have taken measures to monitor and protect our systems and the data in our possession, these measures\nhave not fully protected our systems in the past and cannot guarantee security in the future. Our IT and\ninfrastructure may be vulnerable to viruses, social engineering, denial-of-service, credential stuffing, ransomware\nand other malware, insecure third-party libraries, application or network vulnerabilities, reliance on third-party\nvendors for patches, unauthorized configurations, employee error and malfeasance, and other sources of disruption,\nand, as a result, unauthorized parties may be able to access our systems and data, including personal data and\nother sensitive and proprietary data, through our systems. Although we have policies and technical controls\nrestricting the access to and sharing of the data we store, as well as requiring encryption of data where\nappropriate, these policies and controls may not be effective in all cases. Any actual or perceived breach or\nsimilar incident could interrupt our operations, harm our reputation, brand, and competitive position, result in\nour platform being unavailable, loss or improper access to, or unavailability of, data, fraudulent transfer of\nfunds, regulatory investigations, proceedings, and significant legal, regulatory, and financial exposure. Any such\nincidents or any perception that our security measures are inadequate could lead to loss of merchant, consumer, or\nDasher confidence in, or decreased use of, our platform, any of which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations. Further, any cyberattacks or actual or perceived breaches or other\nincidents directed at, or suffered by, our competitors could reduce confidence in our industry as a whole and, as a\nresult, reduce confidence in us.\nAny actual or perceived breach or other security incident impacting any entities with which we share or disclose\ndata (including, for example, our vendors) could have similar effects. Our ability to monitor our vendors’ security\nmeasures and respond to any incidents impacting them is limited. There have been and may continue to be significant\nsupply chain attacks, and we cannot guarantee that our or our vendors’ systems have not been breached or that they\ndo not contain exploitable defects, bugs, or vulnerabilities that could result in an incident, breach, or other\ndisruption to, our or our vendors’ systems.\nAdditionally, defending against claims or litigation based on any breach or incident, regardless of their merit,\ncould be costly and divert management’s attention. While we maintain cybersecurity insurance that may help provide\ncoverage for\n54\nTable of Contents\nthese types of incidents and resulting claims, we cannot be certain that our insurance coverage will be adequate\nfor liabilities incurred relating to any breach or incident, that insurance will continue to be available to us on\ncommercially reasonable terms or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The\nsuccessful assertion of any claim against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, or changes in our insurance\npolicies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could\nhave an adverse effect on our reputation, brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the on-demand local commerce category does not continue to grow, or grows slower than we expect, our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe on-demand local commerce category has grown rapidly since we launched our platform in 2013, but it is uncertain\nto what extent the market for local commerce platforms will continue to grow. The markets for certain services we\nfacilitate, in particular convenience, grocery, advertising, and certain other categories, are in earlier stages of\ndevelopment than our restaurant category, and it is uncertain whether demand for these services will continue to\ngrow and achieve stable, widespread market acceptance. In addition, through our acquisition of Wolt, we have\nentered many geographies where the development of the on-demand local commerce category is in different stages of\nmarket acceptance. Our success will depend to a substantial extent on the willingness of people to widely adopt on-\ndemand local commerce platforms. If merchants and consumers do not embrace the transition to on-demand local\ncommerce platforms as we expect, including as a result of concerns regarding safety, affordability, or for other\nreasons, whether as a result of incidents on our platform or on our competitors’ platforms or otherwise, or instead\nadopt alternative solutions that may arise, then the market for our platform may not further develop or may develop\nslower than we expect, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe are committed to the long-term success of our business, including by expanding our platform and enhancing the\nDoorDash experience, which may not maximize short-term financial results and may yield results that conflict with\nthe market’s expectations, which could result in our stock price being adversely affected.\nWe are committed to the long-term success of our business, including by expanding our platform and enhancing the\nDoorDash experience, which we believe will ultimately drive long-term shareholder value. However, expanding our\nplatform and continually enhancing the DoorDash experience requires steady and significant investments, which may\nnot necessarily maximize short-term financial results. We frequently make business decisions that may negatively\nimpact our short-term financial results when we believe that the decisions are consistent with our goals to improve\nthe DoorDash experience, which we believe will improve our financial results over the long term. These decisions\nmay not be consistent with the short-term expectations of our stockholders and may not produce the long-term\nbenefits that we expect, in which case our growth, business, financial condition, and results of operations could\nbe adversely affected.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activity of merchants, consumers, or Dashers, whether or not\noccurring while using our platform, could expose us to liability and adversely affect our business, brand,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nIllegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities by merchants, consumers, or Dashers, including the\nactivities of individuals who may have previously engaged with, but are not then receiving or providing services\noffered through, our platform or individuals who are impersonating consumers or Dashers, have occurred, and in the\nfuture may occur, which could adversely affect our brand, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThese activities include food tampering, inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery,\ndangerous or unlawful vehicular operation, assault, battery, theft, unauthorized use of credit and debit cards or\nbank accounts, registering Dasher accounts with us with stolen personal information, consumer identity theft, and\nother misconduct. Such activities may result in physical injury, loss of life, property damage, and financial\ndamage for consumers and third parties, and business interruptions, reputational and brand damage, or other\nsignificant liabilities for us.\nWe have in the past incurred, and may in the future incur, losses from various types of fraud, including use of\nstolen or fraudulent credit card, debit card, or bank account information, fraud with respect to background checks,\nfraud by employees or agents relating to payments or credits on our platform, exploitation of system bugs or\nvulnerabilities to circumvent payment requirements, account takeovers of merchant, consumer, or Dasher accounts by\nbad actors, and other unauthorized uses of another person's identity. For example, bad actors have created Dasher\naccounts using stolen personal identifying information for illicit purposes. Among other things, in the United\nStates, this has caused Form 1099s to be incorrectly sent to individuals who are not performing services as\nDashers. In addition, under current credit card practices, we may be liable for orders facilitated on our platform\nwith fraudulent credit card data, even if the associated financial institution approved the credit card\ntransaction.\n55\nTable of Contents\nWhile we have implemented various measures intended to anticipate, identify, and address the risk of these types of\nillegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, these measures may\nnot adequately address or prevent all such activity from occurring or scale efficiently with our business and such\nconduct could expose us to liability, including through litigation or regulatory action, or adversely affect our\nbrand or reputation. At the same time, if the measures we have taken to guard against these illegal, improper, or\notherwise inappropriate activities, such as our requirement that all Dashers undergo a background check where\npermitted by applicable law, are too restrictive and inadvertently prevent Dashers and consumers otherwise in good\nstanding from using our platform, or if we are unable to implement and communicate these measures fairly and\ntransparently or are perceived to have failed to do so, or if our competitors do not adopt similar measures, the\ngrowth of Dashers and consumers on our platform and their use of our platform could be adversely affected. Any\nnegative publicity related to incidents involving illegal, improper, or otherwise inappropriate activities, or the\nmeasures we adopt to mitigate the risk of such incidents, whether such incidents occurred on our platform or on our\ncompetitors’ platforms, could adversely affect our reputation and brand or public perception of our industry as a\nwhole, which could negatively affect demand for platforms like ours, and potentially lead to increased regulatory\nor litigation exposure.\nOur platform facilitates deliveries to consumers from non-partner merchants, and we face certain risks associated\nwith these deliveries.\nWe aim to have a broad selection of merchants on our platform, which sometimes includes facilitating deliveries to\nconsumers from non-partner merchants. Facilitating deliveries from non-partner merchants is generally less\noperationally efficient than doing so with partner merchants, as our platform is not integrated with non-partner\nmerchants’ systems. As a result, we generally experience higher operational expenses for each order and a higher\nlikelihood of errors. The occurrence of any errors, delays with orders, or other problems associated with\nfacilitating deliveries with non-partner merchants could create a negative perception of our platform and cause\ndamage to our reputation and brand.\nSome non-partner merchants may not want to be included on our platform and may request to be removed. There is a\nrisk that non-partner merchants will bring legal claims against us relating to their inclusion on our platform. In\naddition, measures have been enacted in many U.S. jurisdictions that prohibit, among other things, on-demand local\ncommerce platforms like ours from facilitating deliveries from restaurants without the restaurants’ prior consent.\nWe have adopted internal policies pursuant to which we generally do not add new non-partner restaurants for\ndelivery on our platform in the United States and require the use of disclaimers with existing non-partner\nrestaurants on our platform in the United States to inform consumers that such restaurants are not partnered with\nus. However, we may continue to add non-partner merchants in categories other than restaurants. We may also\ncontinue to revise and update our internal policies related to non-partner restaurants and other merchants. To the\nextent we are required or we choose to remove non-partner merchants for any reason, this may adversely affect our\nability to provide a broad selection of merchants on our platform, attract and retain consumers and could directly\nand adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we do not continue to innovate and further develop our platform, our platform developments do not perform, or we\nare not able to keep pace with technological developments, we may not remain competitive and our business and\nresults of operations could suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to continue to innovate and further develop our platform. To remain\ncompetitive, we must continuously enhance and improve the functionality and features of our platform, including our\nwebsites and mobile applications and the suite of merchant services that we offer through our platform. To compete\neffectively, we must also provide a convenient, efficient, and reliable merchant and consumer experience on our\nplatform, and we may be unable to effectively address merchant and consumer needs or identify emerging consumer\ntrends. If competitors introduce new features, offerings, or technologies, or if new industry standards and\npractices or consumer trends emerge, our existing technology, services, websites, and mobile applications may\nbecome less popular or obsolete. For example, our competitors may develop and commercialize autonomous and drone\ndelivery technologies at scale before we or our partners do. In the event that our competitors bring autonomous or\ndrone delivery to market before we do, or their technology is, or is perceived to be, superior to our or our\npartners’ technology, they may be able to leverage such technology to compete more effectively with us, which would\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our future success could depend on\nour ability to invest in, develop, and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and\npractices in a cost-effective and timely manner.\nWe have scaled our business rapidly and significant new platform features and services have in the past resulted\nin, and in the future may continue to result in, operational challenges affecting our business. Developing and\nlaunching enhancements to, and new services on, our platform may involve significant technical risks, the time and\nattention of our personnel, including management and key employees, and upfront capital investments that may not\ngenerate return on\n56\nTable of Contents\ninvestment. We may use new technologies ineffectively, or we may fail to adapt to emerging industry standards. If\nwe face material delays in introducing new or enhanced platform features and services or if our recently introduced\nofferings do not perform in accordance with our expectations, the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize\nour platform may forgo the use of our services in favor of those of our competitors.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses.\nWe face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail businesses,\nincluding DashMart and Wolt Market. To build and expand our self-operated businesses, we have made substantial\ninvestments, including in establishing and managing a reliable supply chain for in-store products, establishing\nsupply-related contractual partnerships, leasing premises, hiring personnel, and rolling out relevant technologies\nand processes. We plan to continue to invest in such businesses in the future. The maintenance and expansion of our\nself-operated businesses requires significant investments, and there is no assurance that we will realize any of\nthe anticipated benefits. In locations where we operate DashMart and Wolt Market, we may not be able to generate a\nsufficient number of orders to cover our fixed costs and make such services viable and we may incur significant\ncosts before we can determine the viability of these DashMart and Wolt Market locations. Our self-operated retail\nlocations also expose us to different regulatory requirements and risks than our Marketplaces and Commerce\nPlatform, in particular with respect to food safety, permit and license requirements, and zoning restrictions. Our\nexpansion into convenience, grocery, and other retail categories, may also result in the diversion of management’s\nattention from other business opportunities as well as the diversion of resources from support functions, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur marketing efforts to help grow our business may not be effective.\nPromoting awareness of our platform is important to our ability to grow our business, and attracting merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers can be costly. We believe that much of the growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that utilize our platform is attributable to our paid marketing initiatives. Our marketing efforts\ncurrently include referrals, affiliate programs, free or discount trials, partnerships, display advertising,\ntelevision, billboards, radio, video, direct mail, social media, email, podcasts, hiring and classified\nadvertisement websites, mobile “push” communications, search engine optimization, and keyword search campaigns. Our\nmarketing initiatives may become increasingly expensive and we may not generate a meaningful return on these\ninitiatives. Even if we increase revenue as a result of our paid marketing efforts, it may not offset the\nadditional marketing expenses we incur. If our marketing efforts to help grow our business are not effective, our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our local commerce platform, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to provide a cost-effective local commerce platform depends on a number of factors, including Dasher\nefficiency and Dasher pay. Dasher efficiency relies on the technology that powers our platform and while we\ncontinue to make significant investments to improve the efficiency and sophistication of our technology, including\nenhancements to demand prediction, forecasting food preparation times at merchants, and optimizing our routing and\nbatching algorithms, there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful and produce the gains in efficiency\nto our platform that we expect. Dasher pay is a major component of the cost of our business and subject to a number\nof risks, including changes to our Dasher pay models and changes in macroeconomic conditions. The cost-\neffectiveness of our platform would also be adversely affected if our operational and technological improvements do\nnot reduce the number of defective orders and accordingly our cost of revenue and refunds and credits. If we are\nunable to maintain or improve the cost-effectiveness of our platform, including with respect to Dasher efficiency,\nDasher pay, and defective orders, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely\naffected.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support may harm our relationships with merchants, consumers, and Dashers and\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers is dependent in part on our ability to provide\nhigh-quality support. Merchants, consumers, and Dashers depend on our support organization to resolve any issues\nrelating to our platform. We rely on third parties to provide some support services and our ability to provide\neffective support is partially dependent on our ability to attract and retain third-party service providers who are\nqualified to support users of our platform and well versed in our platform. As we continue to grow our business and\nimprove our offerings, we will face challenges related to providing high-quality support services at scale.\nAdditionally, as we continue to grow our international business and the number of non-U.S. based users on our\nplatform, our support organization will face additional challenges, including those associated with delivering\nsupport in languages other than English and in ways consistent with\n57\nTable of Contents\nthe customs and dominant technologies used in the various geographies in which we operate. Any failure to maintain\nhigh-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support, could harm our\nreputation and adversely affect our ability to scale our platform and business, our financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe experience significant seasonal fluctuations in our financial results, which could cause our Class A common\nstock price to fluctuate.\nOur business is highly dependent on consumer spending habits and Dasher behavior patterns, each of which have a\nsignificant impact on our growth and expenses. We experience changes in consumer activity over the course of the\ncalendar year, although our rapid growth in historical periods has made, and may continue to make, seasonal\nfluctuations difficult to detect. For example, consumer activity may be impacted by weather. Colder or more\ninclement weather may increase consumer demand, while warmer or sunny weather may decrease consumer demand. In\ncontrast, the number of available Dashers may decrease during periods of cold or inclement weather when we need\nmore Dashers available to fulfill orders driven by increased consumer demand. In such instances, we typically rely\non incentive pay to attract sufficient Dashers to maintain the quality of our platform, which increases our costs.\nFurther, severe weather can cause businesses, including restaurants, to close, making it impossible to fulfill\ndeliveries. We also benefit from increased order volume in our campus markets when school is in session, and we\nexperience a decrease in order volume when school is not in session and during summer breaks and other vacation\nperiods, causing adverse effects to our business during impacted periods. Seasonality will likely cause\nfluctuations in our financial results on a quarterly basis. In addition, other seasonal trends may develop and the\nexisting seasonal trends that we experience may become more pronounced and contribute to greater fluctuations in\nour results of operations as we continue to scale and our growth slows. As such, we may not accurately forecast our\nresults of operations and we may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our revenue is less than\nexpected, causing our results of operations to fail to meet our expectations or the expectations of investors.\nThe impact of adverse economic conditions and other trends, including the resulting effects on consumer spending\nand merchant operations, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges to economic conditions can impact consumer spending in the regions where we do business, which can prompt\nconsumers to reduce spending on our platform or forgo spending on our platform altogether. Any factor that impacts\nconsumer spending broadly may also impact consumer spending on our platform. Some of these factors include\nunemployment, inflation, consumer debt, fluctuations in household net worth, fluctuations in gasoline, vehicle, and\ntransportation costs, increased food costs, fluctuations in commodity prices, declines in asset prices, residential\nreal estate and mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, changes in interest rates and credit availability,\nchanges in saving rates, and consumer confidence in the current and future political and economic environment.\nEconomic conditions in certain regions may also be affected or exacerbated by natural disasters, such as\nearthquakes, hurricanes, wildfires, and threats to public health. Additionally, volatility in the global financial\nmarkets, or in specific segments of those markets, may contribute to banks and financial institutions with whom we\nhave banking or payment processing relationships entering receivership or becoming insolvent in the future, and we\nmay be unable to access or may lose some or all of our existing cash and cash equivalents to the extent those funds\nare not insured or otherwise protected by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or other insurance programs.\nSuch volatility may also adversely impact any funds held temporarily at our third-party payment processors.\nIn addition, merchants on our platform may be negatively impacted by supply chain issues, labor shortages,\ninflation, or other macroeconomic factors. Labor shortages and supply chain issues at merchants could negatively\nimpact their ability to fulfill orders, which could negatively impact volume on our Marketplaces and in our\nCommerce Platform. Inflationary pressures could drive merchant prices higher, which could negatively impact\nconsumer demand and drive lower order volume on our Marketplaces and in our Commerce Platform. Small businesses\nthat do not have substantial resources, like many of the merchants on our platform, tend to be more adversely\naffected by poor economic conditions than large businesses. If merchants on our platform, including our small\nbusiness merchants, cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business\ndisruption, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, and they may be less likely\nto use our platform.\nAs our business has grown, we have increasingly become subject to risks arising from adverse global economic and\npolitical conditions, including the conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine. Both these conflicts have had, and\nmay continue to have, an adverse impact on macroeconomic conditions in their respective regions and given rise to\nvolatility and instability in a manner that adversely affects our business and merchants, consumers, and courier\npartners on our platform in those regions.\n58\nTable of Contents\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations into new geographic markets and categories in which we have\nlimited or no prior operating experience.\nIn an effort to continue increasing our long-term growth potential, we have in the past, and may in the future,\nexpand our operations into new geographic markets and categories. It may be difficult for us to understand and\naccurately predict consumer preferences and purchasing habits in these new geographic markets and categories. In\naddition, each market and category has unique regulatory dynamics. These include laws and regulations that can\ndirectly or indirectly affect our ability to operate, the pool of Dashers that are available, and other operational\ncosts. In addition, each market and category is subject to distinct competitive and operational dynamics. These\ninclude our ability to offer more attractive services than alternative options and our ability to efficiently\nattract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers, all of which affect our sales, results of operations, and key\nbusiness metrics. As a result, we may experience fluctuations in our results of operations due to the changing\ndynamics in the geographic markets and categories in which we operate. If we invest substantial time and resources\nto expand our operations and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected. Information on risks associated with entry into new markets\ninternationally are described in more detail under the section titled “— Our international operations and any\nfuture international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful. ”\nInformation on risks associated with entry into certain new categories are described in more detail under the\nsection titled “— We face certain risks in connection with our self-operated convenience, grocery, and other retail\nbusinesses .”\nWe are subject to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange risk as a result of our operations in foreign countries. When\nconducting business in foreign countries, including through Wolt and our other subsidiaries and affiliates, such\nbusiness is typically denominated in the local currency of the respective country, which exposes us to the risk of\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary foreign currency exposure is currently to the Euro,\nthe Canadian dollar, the Israeli shekel, and the Australian dollar. Additionally, because our financial statements\nare presented in U.S. dollars, local functional currencies will be converted into U.S. dollars at the applicable\nexchange rates for inclusion in our financial statements, thereby increasing our foreign exchange translation risk.\nWe depend on our highly skilled employees to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain,\nmanage, and motivate our employees, or if our new employees do not perform as we anticipate, we may not be able to\ngrow effectively and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend in part on the continued service of our founders, senior management team, key\ntechnical employees, and other highly skilled employees, including Tony Xu, our co-founder and Chief Executive\nOfficer, and on our ability to continue to identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain talented employees. We may\nnot be able to retain the services of any of our employees or other members of senior management in the future.\nAlso, all of our U.S.-based employees, including our senior management team and Mr. Xu, work for us on an at-will\nbasis, and there is no assurance that any such employee will remain with us. Our competitors may be successful in\nrecruiting and hiring members of our management team or other key employees, and it may be difficult for us to find\nsuitable replacements on a timely basis, on competitive terms, or at all. If we are unable to attract and retain\nthe necessary employees, particularly in critical areas of our business, we may not achieve our strategic goals. In\naddition, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively and to execute its plans and strategies, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe face intense competition for highly skilled employees, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area where we have a\nsubstantial presence and need for highly skilled employees. To attract and retain top talent, we have had to offer,\nand we believe we will need to continue to offer, competitive compensation and benefits packages. Job candidates\nand existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their\nemployment. The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in\nresponse to various factors and may not appreciate. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines for this\nor other reasons, it may adversely affect our ability to attract and retain highly qualified employees. Certain of\nour employees have received, and may in the future receive, significant proceeds from sales of our equity, which\nmay reduce their motivation to continue to work for us. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and\nequity to attract and retain new employees and expend significant time and resources to identify, recruit, train,\nand integrate such employees, and we may never realize returns on these investments. If we are unable to\neffectively manage our hiring needs or successfully integrate new hires, our efficiency, ability to meet forecasts,\nand employee morale, productivity, and engagement could suffer, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\n59\nTable of Contents\nOur company culture has contributed to our success and if we cannot maintain and evolve our culture as we grow, our\nbusiness could be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our company culture, which promotes authenticity, empathy, support for others, and bias for action,\nhas been critical to our success. We face a number of challenges that may affect our ability to sustain our\ncorporate culture, including:\nfailure to identify, attract, reward, and retain people in leadership positions in our organization who share and\nfurther our culture, values, and mission;\nthe increasing size and geographic diversity of our workforce;\nan increasing share of our workforce working remotely, on hybrid schedules, and spending less time collaborating\nin offices;\nthe integration of new personnel and businesses from acquisitions;\ncompetitive pressures to move in directions that may divert us from our mission, vision, and values;\nthe continued challenges of a rapidly evolving industry;\nthe increasing need to develop expertise in new areas of business that affect us; and\nnegative perception of our treatment of employees, merchants, consumers, and Dashers or our response to employee\nsentiment related to political or social causes or actions of management.\nIf we are not able to maintain and evolve our culture, our business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be\nimpaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of\n2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of the Nasdaq\nStock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\"). We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to\nincrease our legal, accounting, and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-\nconsuming, and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting, which includes hiring additional accounting and financial personnel to implement\nsuch processes and controls.\nIn order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control\nover financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources,\nincluding accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. If any of these new or improved controls\nand systems, or the existing systems and third-party software applications that we rely on for financial reporting,\ndo not perform as expected, we may experience further deficiencies in our controls and we may not be able to meet\nour financial reporting obligations. We also need to implement, integrate, and maintain effective internal control\nover financial reporting at companies we acquire, and any failure to do so could impact our ability to meet our\nfinancial reporting obligations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be\ndiscovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in\ntheir implementation or improvement could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting\nobligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement\nand maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of\nperiodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports\nregarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our\nperiodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could also cause\n60\nTable of Contents\ninvestors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative\neffect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these\nrequirements, we may not be able to remain listed on Nasdaq.\nAdditionally, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness\nof our internal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a\nreport that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations and could\ncause a decline in the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that\nour platform is accessible, which would adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve the availability of our platform and\nto enable rapid releases of new features and services. However, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain\nand improve the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times and as our platform becomes more\ncomplex and our user traffic increases. If our platform is unavailable when merchants, consumers, and Dashers\nattempt to access it or it does not load as quickly as they expect or it experiences capacity constraints due to an\nexcessive number of users accessing our platform simultaneously, users may seek other offerings, and may not return\nto our platform as often in the future, or at all. This could adversely affect our ability to attract merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers and decrease the frequency with which they use our platform. To the extent that we do not\neffectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed, or continually develop our technology and\nnetwork architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business, reputation,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe may use artificial intelligence in our business, and challenges with properly managing its use could result in\nreputational harm, competitive harm, and legal liability, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may incorporate artificial intelligence (“AI”) solutions into our platform, offerings, services, and features,\nor in support of internal business operations, and these applications may become important in our operations over\ntime. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate AI into their products more quickly or more\nsuccessfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of\noperations. Additionally, if the content, analyses, or recommendations that AI applications assist in producing are\nor are alleged to be deficient, inaccurate, inappropriate, or biased, or if the use of AI results in, or is alleged\nto have resulted in, the infringement of the intellectual property of third parties, we may be subject to legal\nclaims or liability and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. The\nuse of AI applications may result in data leakage or unauthorized exposure of data, including confidential business\ninformation, the personal data of end users, or other sensitive information. Such leakage or unauthorized exposure\nof data related to our use of AI applications could result in legal claims or liability or otherwise adversely\naffect our reputation and results of operations. AI also presents emerging ethical and regulatory issues and if our\nuse of AI becomes controversial, we may experience brand or reputational harm, competitive harm, or legal\nliability. The rapid evolution of AI, including the development of government regulation of AI and automated\ndecision-making technology more generally, may require significant resources to develop, test, and maintain our\nplatform, offerings, services, and features to help us implement AI and automated decision-making technology more\ngenerally in a manner that complies with applicable laws and regulations and ethically in order to minimize\nunintended, harmful impact.\nDefects, errors, or vulnerabilities in our applications, backend systems, or other technology systems and those of\nthird-party technology providers could harm our reputation and brand and adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nThe software underlying our platform is highly complex and may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some\nof which may only be discovered after the code has been released. Our practice is to effect frequent releases of\nsoftware updates, sometimes multiple times per day. The third-party software that we incorporate into our platform\nmay also be subject to errors or vulnerabilities. Any errors or vulnerabilities discovered in our code or from\nthird-party software after release could result in negative publicity and a loss of users, revenue, and\navailability of our platform, as well as other performance issues. Such vulnerabilities could also be exploited by\nmalicious actors and result in exposure of data of users on our platform, or otherwise result in a security breach\nor other security incident. We may need to expend significant financial and development resources to analyze,\ncorrect, eliminate, or work around errors or defects or to address and eliminate vulnerabilities. Any failure to\ntimely and effectively resolve any such errors, defects, or\n61\nTable of Contents\nvulnerabilities could adversely affect our business, reputation, brand, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” in which shares of our Class A common stock are sold into the market on behalf\nof RSU holders upon vesting or settlement of RSUs to cover tax withholding liabilities and such sales will result\nin dilution to our stockholders.\nWe have implemented “sell-to-cover” to satisfy tax withholding obligations that arise upon the vesting and\nsettlement of RSUs we issue to employees and service providers, pursuant to which shares with a market value\nequivalent to the tax withholding obligation are sold on behalf of the holder of the RSUs upon vesting and\nsettlement to cover the tax withholding liability and the cash proceeds from such sales are remitted by us to the\ntaxing authorities. Some holders may also elect to pay cash directly to us to cover such withholding obligations,\nbut in a significant majority of cases, shares are sold on behalf of each holder upon the vesting and settlement of\nthe RSUs. While such sales will not result in the expenditure of additional cash by us to satisfy the tax\nwithholding obligations for RSUs, it will cause dilution to our stockholders and, to the extent a large number of\nshares are sold in connection with any vesting event, such sales volume may cause our stock price to fluctuate.\nWe track certain operational metrics with internal systems and tools and do not independently verify such metrics.\nCertain of our operational metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and any real or perceived\ninaccuracies in such metrics may adversely affect our business and reputation.\nWe track certain operational metrics, including our merchant, consumer, and Dasher counts, key business and non-\nGAAP metrics, such as Total Orders, Marketplace GOV, Contribution Profit, Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross\nProfit, Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow, and certain other metrics required by\nregulatory and administrative bodies, such as the monthly active recipients of our services in the EU (as required\nby Article 24(2) of the Digital Services Act), with internal systems and tools that are not independently verified\nby any third party and which may differ from estimates or similar metrics published by third parties due to\ndifferences in sources, methodologies, or the assumptions on which we rely. Our internal systems and tools have a\nnumber of limitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we publicly disclose. If the internal systems and tools we\nuse to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithmic or other technical errors,\nthe data we report may not be accurate. While these numbers are based on what we believe to be reasonable estimates\nof our metrics for the applicable period of measurement, there are inherent challenges in measuring how our\nplatform is used across large populations. For example, the accuracy of our operating metrics could be impacted by\nfraudulent users of our platform, and further, we believe that there are consumers who have multiple accounts, even\nthough this is prohibited in our terms of service and we implement measures to detect and prevent this behavior.\nConsumer usage of multiple accounts may cause us to overstate the number of consumers on our platform. In addition,\nlimitations or errors with respect to how we measure data or with respect to the data that we measure may affect\nour understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our long-term strategies. If our operating\nmetrics are not accurate representations of our business, if investors do not perceive our operating metrics to be\naccurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to these figures, investors may lose confidence in\nour operating metrics and business and we expect that we could be subject to legal claims, including securities\nclass action lawsuits, and our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations could be\nadversely affected.\nOur actual losses may exceed our insurance reserves, which could adversely affect our financial condition and\nresults of operations.\nWe establish insurance reserves for claims incurred but not yet paid and claims incurred but not yet reported and\nany related estimable expenses, and we periodically evaluate and, as necessary, adjust our actuarial assumptions\nand insurance reserves as our experience develops or new information is learned. We employ various predictive\nmodeling and actuarial techniques and make numerous assumptions based on limited historical experience and industry\nstatistics to estimate our insurance reserves. Estimating the number and severity of claims, as well as related\njudgment or settlement amounts, is inherently difficult, subjective, and speculative. Additionally, actuarial\nprojections make no provision for the extraordinary future emergence of losses or types of losses not sufficiently\nrepresented in the historical data or which are not yet quantifiable. A number of external factors can affect the\nactual losses incurred for any given claim, including but not limited to the length of time the claim remains open,\nfluctuations in healthcare costs, legislative and regulatory developments, judicial developments and unexpected\nevents such as natural or human-made catastrophic disasters or negative publicity. Such factors can impact the\nreserves for claims incurred but not yet paid as well as the actuarial assumptions used to estimate the reserves\nfor claims incurred but not yet reported and any related estimable expenses for current and historical periods. For\nany of the foregoing reasons, our actual losses for claims and related expenses may deviate, individually or in the\naggregate, from the insurance reserves reflected in our financial statements. If we determine that our estimated\ninsurance reserves are inadequate, we may be required to increase such reserves at the time of the\n62\nTable of Contents\ndetermination, which could result in an increase to our net loss in the period in which the shortfall is determined\nand negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in the Internet and mobile device accessibility of users.\nOur business depends on users’ access to our platform via a mobile device or personal computer and the Internet.\nInternet access and access to a mobile device or personal computer are frequently provided by companies with\nsignificant market power that could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of consumers’ ability\nto access our platform. In addition, the Internet infrastructure that we and users of our platform rely on in any\nparticular geographic area may be unable to support the demands placed upon it and could interfere with the speed\nand availability of our platform. Any such failure in Internet or mobile device or computer accessibility, even for\na short period of time, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of\nother jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be\nadversely affected.\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and\nother legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in\njurisdictions in Europe and Asia, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as\nindependent contractors. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors\nvary by jurisdiction and are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can\ncreate uncertainty and unpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and consumers that use our\nplatform. For example, in January 2024, the U.S. Department of Labor released a final rule regarding the\nclassification of employees and independent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, which\nimplements new interpretative guidance for classification of workers.\nWhile we maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors,\nDashers may be reclassified as employees due to changes in the law or its interpretation. A reclassification of\nDashers as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including\nas a result of:\nmonetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and\nhour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide\nrequired breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including\nrelated to PAGA and government fines;\ninjunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\nclaims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\nclaims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\nclaims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\nother claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees,\nincluding risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\nharm to our reputation and brand.\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly\nalter our existing business model and operations in order to continue to operate our platform, which would result\nin significant increased costs and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain couriers on our\nplatform, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. A reclassification of Dashers as employees could also result in an increase to the fees we charge to\nconsumers and the commissions we charge to merchants, which in turn could affect our ability to attract and retain\nconsumers and merchant partners, and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher\nclassification. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought,\nfor example, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled\npursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of\nDashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District\nAttorney filed a claim against us in the\n63\nTable of Contents\nSuperior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified California Dashers as\nindependent contractors as opposed to employees. For more details on this action, please see the section titled \"\nLegal Proceedings \" above in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q.\nSome jurisdictions in the United States, Europe, and Asia have modified, or are considering modifying, their\nstandards used to determine worker classification. For example, California Assembly Bill 5 (\"AB 5\"), which codified\nthe Dynamex standard of contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs,\nbecame effective on January 1, 2020. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for Proposition\n22 (“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was approved by voters\nin November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. In 2021, a group of plaintiffs challenged the\nconstitutionality of Proposition 22 in state court in California. That case proceeded through the state court\nsystem until July 2024, when the Supreme Court of California ruled unanimously to uphold the core of Proposition\n22.\nCertain provisions of Proposition 22 regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable\nto us and Dashers in California. These provisions have increased our costs related to Dashers in California. To\noffset a portion of these increased costs, in certain circumstances we charge higher fees and commissions, which\ncould result in lower order volumes over time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and\ncommissions, these increased costs could also lead to a lower Net Revenue Margin, defined as revenue expressed as a\npercentage of Marketplace GOV.\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate have adopted or may be considering, or in the future may consider,\nadopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or\nvoluntary agreements with third parties, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections\nand benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation,\nballot initiatives, other legislative processes, or agreements, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in\nsuch jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if it becomes\nnecessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely affect our results\nof operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation\ncould still be challenged and subject to litigation.\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent\ncontractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to\nlocal regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent\ncontractors. For example, on November 1, 2021, the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration (through\nthe Division at the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland) issued a decision which deemed that\nWolt courier partners in Finland are in an employment relationship with Wolt, and that Wolt should be mandated to\nkeep statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. Although we appealed the decision and, in February\n2024, the Administrative Court of Hämeenlinna issued a decision concluding that Wolt courier partners are not in an\nemployment relationship with Wolt, this decision is subject to further appeal and we may be subject to similar\nactions in other jurisdictions. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing the standards used to\ndetermine worker classification, which may impact the classification of Dashers using our platform. For example,\nthe EU's Platform Work Directive, which was agreed to in March 2024, will require EU member states to transpose its\nrequirements to their national laws, including enacting new national laws for determining worker classification of\nplatform workers, and may involve differing implementation by the various member states. Such EU-wide legislative\nreforms may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent contractor model within the European\nEconomic Area (the \"EEA\").\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, or for\nother reasons, we may decide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result\nin certain operational challenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain jurisdictions or decide\nnot to expand our business in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion\nopportunities.\nWe are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability,\nexpenses, and harm to our business as a result.\nWe face potential liability, legal expenses, and harm to our business relating to the nature of our business\ngenerally, and with the delivery services we facilitate in particular. Specifically, we are subject to claims,\nlawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands, and other legal, regulatory, and\nother administrative proceedings, including those involving personal injury, property damage, worker\nclassification, labor and employment, anti-discrimination, commercial disputes, competition, consumer complaints,\nintellectual property disputes, marketing and advertising to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, compliance with\nregulatory requirements, and other matters, and we\n64\nTable of Contents\nmay become subject to additional types of claims, lawsuits, government investigations, and legal or regulatory\nproceedings as our business grows and as we deploy new services.\nWe are also subject to claims, lawsuits, and other legal proceedings seeking to hold us vicariously liable for the\nactions of merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, third parties could assert legal claims against us in\nconnection with personal injuries related to food poisoning, tampering, or other food safety issues or accidents\ncaused by merchants and Dashers that utilize our platform. Regardless of the outcome of any legal proceeding, any\ninjuries to, or deaths of, any consumers, Dashers, employees, or third parties could result in negative publicity\nand harm to our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nReports, whether true or not, of food-borne illnesses and injuries caused by food tampering or inappropriate or\nunsanitary food preparation, handling, or delivery, or other food safety incidents have led to threatened and\nactual legal claims against, and severely injured the reputations of, participants in the food business and could\ndo so in the future as well. Further, if any such report were to affect one or more of the merchants on our\nplatform that generate a significant percentage of our overall business, it could seriously harm our business.\nFurther, food and other products that are ordered through our platform could be subject to a recall, but we may\nhave limited ability, if any, to ensure compliance with a recall. In addition, reports of food-borne illnesses,\nfood and other product recalls, food tampering, or inappropriate or unsanitary food preparation, handling, or\ndelivery, even those occurring solely at merchants that are not on our platform, could, as a result of negative\npublicity about the restaurant or grocery industry, adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results\nof operations.\nWe also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other representative\nactions, by or relating to Dashers regarding, among other things, the classification of Dashers that utilize our\nplatform as well as our Dasher pay models, including claims regarding disclosures we make with respect to Dasher\nearnings, service fees, delivery fees, and gratuities, the process of signing up to become a Dasher, including our\nbackground check processes, removal of platform access, and the nature and frequency of our communications to\nDashers via email, text, or telephone. We also face potential liability and expense for claims, including class\nactions, by or relating to consumers regarding, among other things, disclosures we make with respect to sales tax,\nconsumer fees, and gratuities, the local delivery fulfillment services we facilitate, discrepancies between the\nitems on our websites and consumer applications and the items advertised at the merchants from which such items are\ndelivered, and the nature and frequency of our marketing communications to consumers via email, text, or telephone.\nIn addition, we face potential liability and expense for claims, including class, collective, and other\nrepresentative actions, by or relating to merchants regarding, among other things, menu pricing, exclusivity\narrangements, and the listing of merchants on our platform without an agreement. Finally, we face potential\nliability and expense for claims relating to the information that we publish on our websites and mobile\napplications, including claims for trademark and copyright infringement, defamation, libel, and negligence, among\nothers.\nThe results of any such claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, government investigations, audits, and demands,\nor other legal or regulatory proceedings cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty. Any claims against us,\nwhether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, be harmful to our reputation,\nrequire significant management attention, and divert significant resources. It is possible that a resolution of one\nor more such proceedings could result in substantial damages, settlement costs, fines, and penalties that could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Determining reserves for our pending\nlitigation is a complex and fact-intensive process that requires significant subjective judgment and speculation.\nThere is no guarantee that our litigation reserves will be sufficient to offset such liabilities. These proceedings\ncould also result in harm to our reputation and brand, sanctions, consent decrees, injunctions, or other orders\nrequiring a change in our business practices. Further, under certain circumstances, we have contractual and other\nlegal obligations to indemnify and to incur legal expenses on behalf of our business and commercial partners and\ncurrent and former directors and officers. Any of these consequences could adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nIn the United States and certain other jurisdictions in which we operate, we include arbitration and class action\nwaiver provisions in our terms of service with the merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform.\nThese provisions are intended to streamline the litigation process for all parties involved, as they can in some\ncases be faster and less costly than litigating disputes in court. However, arbitration can be costly and\nburdensome, and the use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions subjects us to certain risks to our\nreputation and brand, as these provisions have been the subject of increasing public scrutiny. In order to minimize\nthese risks to our reputation and brand, we may limit our use of arbitration and class action waiver provisions or\nbe required to do so in a legal or regulatory proceeding, either of which could cause an increase in our litigation\ncosts and exposure. Additionally, we permit certain users of our platform to opt out of such provisions, which\ncould also cause an increase in our litigation costs and exposure.\n65\nTable of Contents\nFurther, with the potential for conflicting rules regarding the scope and enforceability of arbitration and class\naction waivers on a state-by-state basis, as well as between U.S. state and federal law, there is a risk that some\nor all of our arbitration and class action waiver provisions could be subject to challenge or may need to be\nrevised to exempt certain categories of protection. If these provisions were found to be unenforceable, in whole or\nin part, or specific claims are required to be exempted, we could experience an increase in our costs to litigate\ndisputes and the time involved in resolving such disputes, and we could face increased exposure to potentially\ncostly lawsuits, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTaxing authorities may successfully assert that we have not properly collected or remitted, or in the future should\ncollect or remit, sales and use, gross receipts, value added, similar taxes or withholding taxes, and may\nsuccessfully impose additional obligations or liabilities on us, and any such assessments, obligations, or\nliabilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe application of non-income, or indirect, taxes, such as sales and use tax, value-added tax, goods and services\ntax, business tax, and gross receipt tax, to businesses like ours is a complex and evolving issue. Many of the\nfundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the adoption and growth of the\nInternet and e-commerce. Significant judgment is required on an ongoing basis to evaluate applicable tax\nobligations, and as a result, amounts recorded are estimates and are subject to adjustments. In many cases, the\nultimate tax determination is uncertain and could exceed the amount of any applicable reserves, if any. In addition\nto our own potential liability, if we or merchants pass along increased additional taxes and raise prices to\nconsumers, our order volume may decline.\nWe are subject to indirect taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, goods and services, and gross receipt\ntaxes, in the United States and foreign jurisdictions where we operate. In certain jurisdictions, we collect and\nremit indirect taxes. However, tax authorities may raise questions about, or challenge or disagree with, our\ncalculation, reporting, or collection of taxes and may require us to collect taxes in jurisdictions in which we do\nnot currently do so or to remit additional taxes and interest, including tax on the cost of goods sold, and could\nimpose associated penalties and fees. A successful assertion by one or more tax authorities requiring us to collect\ntaxes in jurisdictions in which we do not currently do so or to collect additional taxes in a jurisdiction in which\nwe currently collect taxes, could result in substantial tax liabilities, including taxes on past sales, as well as\npenalties and interest, could discourage merchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could\notherwise harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, even where we are collecting\ntaxes and remitting them to the appropriate authorities, we may fail to accurately calculate, collect, report, and\nremit such taxes.\nThe United States and certain foreign jurisdictions have tax rules generally requiring payors to obtain payee\ntaxpayer information and report payments to unrelated parties to the government. Under certain circumstances, a\nfailure to comply with such obligations may cause us to become liable for monetary penalties or to withhold a\npercentage of the amounts paid to Dashers and merchants and remit such amounts to the taxing authorities. Due to\nthe large number of Dashers and merchants, and the amounts paid to each, process failures with respect to these\nreporting obligations could result in substantial financial liability and other consequences to us if we were\nunable to remedy such failures in a timely manner. Certain risks relating to employment taxes are described in more\ndetail under the section titled \"— If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S.\nfederal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations would be adversely affected. \"\nIn addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenue, which could result in legislative\naction to increase indirect taxes, including digital services taxes. Such legislative action could discourage\nmerchants, consumers, and Dashers from utilizing our offerings, or could otherwise harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts\nrecorded in our financial statements and any such difference may adversely affect our results of operations in\nfuture periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is\ndetermined.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. Our provision for (benefit\nfrom) income taxes is a function of the manner in which we operate our business, and any changes to such operations\nor laws applicable to such operations may affect our effective tax rate. The determination of our worldwide\nprovision for (benefit from) income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by management\nand, in the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate\ntax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our provision for (benefit from) income taxes is\nreasonable, the ultimate outcome may differ from the\n66\nTable of Contents\namounts recorded in our financial statements and could materially affect our financial results in the period or\nperiods for which such determination is made.\nIn addition, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in our business operations,\nacquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, changes in our stock price, intercompany\ntransactions, changes in law or administrative interpretations thereof, changes in accounting principles, changes\nto our forecasts of income and loss, changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates, certain non-deductible expenses, or changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and\nliabilities.\nLegislative changes or administrative practices may increase our tax obligations and exposures and could adversely\naffect our business results and operations.\nThe U.S. federal, state, and local governments, countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and\norganizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes\nto existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in jurisdictions where we do business. If\none or more of these jurisdictions change applicable tax laws or successfully challenge our interpretations of such\nlaws, including how or where our profits and losses are currently recognized, our overall taxes could increase, and\nour business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nAn increasing number of jurisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose\nnew tax measures, including revenue-based taxes and additional reporting obligations, targeting online commerce and\nthe remote selling of goods and services. These include new obligations to withhold or collect sales, consumption,\nvalue added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in\nliability for third-party obligations. Jurisdictions have also proposed or enacted taxes on gross revenue derived\nfrom, for example, sales of online advertising services and the provision of digital intermediary services such as\nthe operation of online marketplaces. Proliferation of these or similar tax measures may continue unless broader\ninternational tax reform is implemented. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by\nadditional taxes imposed on us prospectively or retroactively, or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the\nfailure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, suppliers,\nand other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases, we also may not\nhave sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply with new reporting or\ncollection obligations by the effective date.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nWhile federal net operating loss (\"NOL\") carryforwards generated on or after January 1, 2018 are not subject to\nexpiration, the deductibility of such NOL carryforwards is limited to 80% of our federal taxable income. Our state\nand foreign NOLs have varying expiration dates beginning in 2024. Utilization of our NOL carryforwards depends on\nour future taxable income, and there is a risk that some of our existing NOL carryforwards and tax credits in\nvarious jurisdictions could expire unused (to the extent subject to expiration) and be unavailable to offset future\ntaxable income. In addition, under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the\n“Code”), loss utilization is limited if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” generally defined as a\ngreater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by significant stockholders or groups of\nstockholders over a three-year period. We may have undergone ownership changes in the past, and we may experience\nownership changes in the future because of shifts in our stock ownership, many of which are outside of our control.\nAs a result, our ability to use our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset future U.S. federal\ntaxable income or income tax liabilities may be, or may become, subject to limitations, which could result in\nincreased future tax liability to us.\nOur business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker\nclassification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, merchant pricing and commissions, and consumer fees and taxes,\nmany of which are unsettled and still developing, and any of which could subject us to legal claims, increased\ncosts, operational burdens, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations.\nThe on-demand local commerce industry and our business model are relatively nascent and rapidly evolving. We are or\nmay become subject to a variety of laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, including those related to\nworker classification, Dasher pay and conditions of work, Dasher deactivations, insurance, merchant pricing and\ncommissions, consumer fees, and taxes. Laws, regulations, and standards governing issues such as worker\nclassification or our relationship with Dashers more generally (for example, those concerning Dasher pay and\ninsurance requirements), labor and employment, anti-discrimination, food safety, alcoholic beverages and other\nhighly regulated products, online payments, gratuities, merchant pricing and commissions, text messaging,\nmembership products, intellectual property, data\n67\nTable of Contents\nretention, privacy, data sharing, data security, consumer protection, consumer fees, antitrust, background checks,\nwebsite and mobile application accessibility, environmental sustainability and related disclosures, and tax and\nother government-imposed fees are often complex, subject to change, and subject to varying interpretations, in many\ncases due to their lack of specificity. The scope and interpretation of these laws, and whether they are applicable\nto us, are often uncertain and may be conflicting, including varying standards and interpretations between U.S. law\nand the laws of other countries, between U.S. state and federal law, between individual states, and even at the\ncity and municipality level. As a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through\njudicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies.\nWe are subject to regulatory review, proceedings, and audits pursuant to national, federal, state, and local laws\nregulating the sale and delivery of alcoholic beverages and other highly regulated products. These regulations and\nlaws may dictate matters such as licensing, permitting, or other governmental review requirements, advertising\nrestrictions, and consumer age verification. Any governmental litigation, fines, or restrictions on our operations\nresulting from the enforcement of these existing regulations, any changes to existing regulations or changes to the\ninterpretation or enforcement of existing regulations, or the adoption of any new legislation or regulations could\nresult in penalties or cause us to have to suspend sales and delivery of highly regulated products in a\njurisdiction for a period of time or result in increased sales or marketing costs, or changes to our business\npractices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation, business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nAs our business grows and evolves and our services are used in a greater number of geographies, we have become\nsubject to a growing array of laws and regulations, which increase the complexity and compliance risk inherent in\nour business. For example, the EU has recently enacted, and is in the process of enacting, various laws and\nregulations that govern digital services and markets and artificial intelligence, and impose environmental\nsustainability obligations and disclosure requirements on businesses like ours. The impact of these new regulations\non the overall industry, business models, and our operations is uncertain. We may be required to enhance our\ndisclosures and undertake certain changes to our products, services, fees and commissions structure, and operations\nas a result of these new requirements, which could subject us to increased administrative costs.\nIn recent years, regulatory scrutiny of larger companies, technology companies, and companies engaged in dealings\nwith independent contractors has increased. As a result, regulatory and administrative bodies may enact new laws or\npromulgate new regulations that are adverse to our business, or they may view matters or interpret laws and\nregulations differently than they have in the past in a manner adverse to our business, including by changing\nemployment-related laws, mandating specific earnings standards or other requirements for Dashers, requiring\nbusinesses like ours to maintain specific auto insurance coverage, or by regulating or capping the commissions\nbusinesses like ours agree to with merchants or the fees that we may charge consumers. For example, in December\n2023, a New York City rule mandating certain minimum earnings standards for certain food delivery workers took\neffect. In addition, some jurisdictions in which we operate have price control measures in effect on local commerce\nplatforms. These price control measures, minimum earnings standards, and similar regulations have caused, and may\nin the future cause, us to increase the fees we charge to consumers. To the extent that price control measures,\nminimum earnings standards, or similar regulations lead to an increase in the fees we charge to consumers, consumer\ndemand for our services could be reduced, which would further harm our business and results of operations. In\naddition, certain jurisdictions may challenge or seek to regulate the way in which we categorize, disclose, or\ncollect consumer fees on our platform. For example, the City of Chicago has challenged such fees as confusing or\nmisleading to consumers.\nIn addition, there is an increasingly active litigation and regulatory environment regarding antitrust and\ncompetition matters in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we operate. We could be subject to claims\nof violations of competition laws in many aspects of our business, including alleged market sharing, price fixing,\nexchange of competitively sensitive information, and with respect to any acquisitions we undertake. For example,\ncompetition authorities in some of the markets in which Wolt operates have made queries regarding, or investigated,\nWolt’s pricing-related terms and other practices and competition authorities and courts have issued decisions\nconcerning Wolt’s pricing-related terms and other practices. Any potential violations of competition laws could\nresult in litigation, fines, restrictions on our operations, render applicable provisions or contracts\nunenforceable, divert management’s attention, and lead to claims for damages and reputational harm, each of which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAny failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could also subject us to claims and other legal and\nregulatory proceedings, fines, or other penalties, criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant\nassets, and other enforcement actions. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a\nresult of lawsuits and legislative proposals could adversely affect our reputation or otherwise impact the growth\nof our business. Any costs incurred to prevent or mitigate this potential liability are also expected to adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n68\nTable of Contents\nWe are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption laws and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and\nregulations.\nWe are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and other anti-\ncorruption, anti-bribery, and anti-money laundering laws in the jurisdictions in which we do business, both\ndomestic and abroad, including EU anti-money laundering directives and related regulations in connection with our\noperations in Europe. The FCPA and other applicable anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws generally prohibit us and\nour employees from improperly influencing government officials or commercial parties in order to obtain or retain\nbusiness, direct business to any person, or gain any improper advantage. These laws may also hold us liable for\nacts of corruption and bribery committed by our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents who are\nacting on our behalf. We and our third-party business partners, representatives, and agents may have direct or\nindirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and\nwe may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and\nintermediaries and our employees, representatives, contractors, and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize\nsuch activities. In addition, we may be subject to liability, including penalties and fines, for any failure to\nsatisfy certain requirements under anti-money laundering laws, such as meeting local “know your customer” and\nongoing due diligence standards. For example, in connection with our operations in Europe, we could be liable for\npenalties of up to 10% of our revenue in a fiscal year in the event that our anti-money laundering compliance\nmeasures are found to be insufficient. All of these laws may also require that we keep accurate books and records\nand maintain internal controls and compliance procedures designed to prevent any such actions. While we have\npolicies and procedures to address compliance with such laws, we cannot assure you that our employees and agents\nwill not take actions in violation of our policies or applicable law, for which we may be ultimately held\nresponsible, and our exposure for violating these laws increases as our international presence expands, including\nas a result of our acquisition of Wolt, and as we increase sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions. Any\nviolation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and anti-money laundering laws could\nresult in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, imposition of significant legal fees,\nloss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions, or suspension or debarment from U.S. government\ncontracts, substantial diversion of management’s attention, a drop in our stock price, or overall adverse\nconsequences to our business, all of which may have an adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to various regulations relating to payment processing.\nThe majority of payments by our consumers are made by credit card or debit card or through third-party payment\nservices, which subjects us to certain payment-related regulations. We may in the future offer new payment options\nto consumers that may be subject to additional regulations and risks. In the United States, money transmitters are\nregulated by numerous state and local governments and agencies, many of which may define money transmitter\ndifferently. If we are found to be a money transmitter under any applicable regulations and we are not in\ncompliance with such regulations, we may be subject to fines or other penalties levied by national, federal, state,\nor local regulators in one or more jurisdictions. Outside of the United States, we are subject to additional laws,\nrules, and regulations related to the provision of payments and financial services. For example, as a result of our\noperations in Europe, we are subject to the revised EU Payment Services Directive (\"PSD II\") and related\nregulations. One of our subsidiaries acts as an intra-group licensed payment service provider and electronic money\ninstitution for its payment services to merchants in the EEA countries and has obtained a payment institution\nlicense and electronic money license from the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority in accordance with PSD II.\nShould our payment institution or electronic money licenses be revoked in the future, or any other enforcement\nmeasures be taken by the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority, such as imposing penalties or forcing us to cease\noffering certain payment facilities, our operations in Europe would be adversely affected. Furthermore, as we\nexpand into new jurisdictions, the payment-related regulations that we are subject to will expand as well. In\naddition to fines, penalties for failing to comply with applicable rules and regulations related to payment\nprocessing could include criminal and civil proceedings, forfeiture of significant assets, or other enforcement\nactions. We could also be required to make significant changes to our business practices or compliance programs as\na result of regulatory scrutiny, which could interrupt our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions and\notherwise adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet, mobile devices, and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes could\nsubstantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the\nInternet, mobile devices, and e-commerce that are constantly evolving. Existing and future laws and regulations, or\nchanges thereto, may impede the growth of the Internet, mobile devices, e-commerce, or other online services, and\nincrease the cost of providing online services, require us to change our business practices, or raise compliance\ncosts or other costs of doing business. These regulations and laws, which continue to evolve, may cover taxation,\ntariffs, user\n69\nTable of Contents\nprivacy, data protection, pricing and commissions, content, copyrights, distribution, social media marketing,\nadvertising practices, sweepstakes, mobile, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection,\nbroadband residential Internet access, and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not always clear how\nexisting laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales, use, and other taxes, libel, and personal privacy\napply to the Internet and e-commerce. In addition, as we continue to expand internationally, it is possible that\nforeign government entities may seek to censor content available on our mobile applications or websites or may even\nattempt to block access to our mobile applications and websites. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply\nwith any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation and brand, a loss in business, and\nproceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, which could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals,\nor any actual or perceived failure by us to comply with such laws and regulations or any other obligations relating\nto privacy or the protection or transfer of data relating to individuals, could adversely affect our business.\nWe receive, transmit, process, and store a large volume of personal data relating to the merchants, consumers, and\nDashers that use our platform, as well as other personal data relating to our employees and other personnel.\nNumerous local, municipal, state, federal, national, and international laws and regulations address privacy and the\ncollection, storing, sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of certain types of data and require the notification\nof certain security breaches involving personal data. These laws and regulations evolve frequently, and their scope\nmay continually change through new legislation, amendments to existing legislation, or changes in enforcement, and\nsuch changes may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Any changes in these laws or regulations could\nadd further complexity, variation in requirements, restrictions, and legal risk; require additional investment of\nresources in compliance and data management programs; and result in changes or increased compliance costs in\nbusiness practices and policies. For example, requirements around consumer health data may restrict our ability to\nprovide personalized content on our platform. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenses in\nour efforts to comply with current and evolving privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity standards and protocols\nimposed by law, regulation, industry standards, or contractual obligations.\nWe are increasingly subject to additional laws relating to privacy, data protection, and cybersecurity both in the\nUnited States and in other jurisdictions where we operate. For example, a growing number of U.S. states have\nenacted comprehensive privacy legislation similar to the California Consumer Privacy Act and, with our expansion in\nthe EU, we have expanded our potential for liability under the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\").\nThese laws impose strict and sometimes inconsistent requirements relating to the processing of personal data as\nwell as significant penalties, such as fines, injunctions against the processing of personal data, and civil\nlitigation claims for noncompliance.\nIn particular, the GDPR imposes significant obligations relating to our processing of EU personal data. We must\ncontinuously adapt to new regulatory guidance and enforcement actions to comply with challenging requirements\nrelating to the lawful processing of personal data, cross-border data transfer, data subject rights requests, and\nmany other areas. Uncertainty resulting from rapidly evolving GDPR requirements could present risks with respect to\nnon-compliance, as well as increased costs to meet our obligations.\nWe are also subject to industry standards, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, which requires\ncompanies to adopt certain measures to ensure the security of cardholder information. We may also be contractually\nrequired to process and secure data in certain manners and to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the\ncosts or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations, or other legal obligations relating to privacy,\ndata protection, information security, or consumer protection.\nAdditionally, our success depends in part on our ability to access, collect, and use data relating to Dashers,\nmerchants, consumers, and other individuals. If the use of tracking technologies, such as “cookies,” is further\nrestricted, regulated, or blocked by new laws, regulations, and other practices, the amount or accuracy of Internet\nuser information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have enacted or are considering enacting legislation or regulations that\nsignificantly restrict the practice of online tracking. Other regulators are increasingly scrutinizing the use of\nonline tracking tools and compliance with requirements related to the online behavioral advertising ecosystem.\nMoreover, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers, such as Apple and Google, plan to or have\nimplemented means to make it easier for Internet users to block tracking technologies or to require new permissions\nfrom users for certain activities, which could, if widely adopted, significantly reduce the effectiveness of such\npractices and technologies. As a result, we may have to develop alternative systems to determine our customers’\nbehavior, customize their online experience, or efficiently market to them.\n70\nTable of Contents\nDespite our efforts to comply with applicable laws, regulations, and other obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, and cybersecurity, it is possible that our interpretations of the law and regulations or our practices\nand platform could be inconsistent with, be alleged to fail, or fail to meet all requirements of, such laws,\nregulations, or obligations. Our failure, or the failure by our vendors, merchants, or Dashers on our platform, to\ncomply with applicable laws or regulations or any other obligations relating to privacy, data protection, or\ncybersecurity, or any compromise of security that results in unauthorized access to, or use or release of personal\ndata or other data relating to merchants, consumers, Dashers, or other individuals, or the perception of privacy\nconcerns or that any of the foregoing types of failure or compromise has occurred, could damage our reputation and\nbrand, discourage new and existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers from using our platform, or result in fines,\ninvestigations, or proceedings by governmental agencies and private claims and litigation, any of which could\nadversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to legal claims resulting from unauthorized text messages sent in violation of the Telephone\nConsumer Protection Act.\nThe actual or perceived improper sending of text messages may subject us to certain risks, including liabilities or\nclaims relating to consumer protection laws. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the \"TCPA\")\nrestricts telemarketing and the use of automated SMS text messages without proper consent. This has resulted, and\nmay in the future result, in civil claims against us. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be\napplicable to the delivery of text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we are not able to comply\nwith these laws and regulations, including the TCPA, in an effective manner, we could be subject to legal claims\nand liability, our brand and reputation may be harmed, and our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our\noperations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance\nproviders are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-\nrelated risks including auto liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data\nbreaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general\nbusiness liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks, we may not be able to, or may choose not to,\nacquire insurance. We may also choose to self-insure for certain types of claims or for certain claims below or\nabove certain dollar amounts. Even if we do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks, we may not obtain\nenough insurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions,\nor deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be\nunable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. In addition, if any of our insurance providers terminate\ntheir relationship with us or refuse to renew their relationships with us on commercially reasonable terms, we\nwould be required to find alternate insurance providers and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable\nreplacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure\ncertain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of\nthe terms of these merchant agreements and could be subject to additional liabilities as a result.\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we\nwould be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-\ninsured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. In addition, if we were to experience an\nunusually large amount of operations-related claims that we self-insure, our financial condition and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many\nbusinesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expenses could increase\nsubstantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed\nor replaced. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the\ncost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage\nlimits, (ii) we experience claims in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on\nour insurance claims, (iv) we experience a significant claim or claims for which coverage is not provided, or (v)\nthe number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or\ninterference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”),\na\n71\nTable of Contents\nthird-party provider of cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We do not have control\nover the operations of the AWS facilities that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption\nfrom natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of\nmisconduct. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will continue to experience, interruptions,\ndelays, and outages in service and availability due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes,\nhuman or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS's\nservice levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users on our platform. Any negative\npublicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand. Since our platform’s continuing and\nuninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the\nattractiveness of our platform, usage of our platform, lead to loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our\nability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nOur primary commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated under certain circumstances. Both\nAWS and we may terminate the agreement only for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, provided the\nterminating party gives prior written notice and a 30-day period to cure the material breach. Although it would be\ndifficult for a number of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud\ninfrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms if it became necessary. In the event that our agreement\nwith AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant\ncosts or downtime for a short period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud\ninfrastructure service providers. However, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud\ninfrastructure service providers would cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of\noperations over the longer term.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small\nnumber of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our\nrelationship with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and\nresults of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and\na small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily Stripe and\nPayPal. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our\nrelationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to\nrenew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment\nprocessors and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame.\nFurther, the software and services provided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations,\nmay contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could\ncause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information,\nor make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of\ntime, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and\nadversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, anti-money laundering,\nand similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors, we may be subject\nto claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher\ntransaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could\nmake our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely on data provided by Stripe and other\npayment service provider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other\nerrors in such data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to\ncomply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The\npayment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that\nmight prohibit us from providing certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If\nwe fail to comply with these rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose\nour ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments,\nand our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed\nto reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by\npayment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\n72\nTable of Contents\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide\naccurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on accredited third-party background check providers to provide the\ncriminal and/or driving history of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those\nthat are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business\nmay be adversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations,\nor the requirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers\nterminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we\nmay need to find alternate providers, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an\nacceptable time frame. In certain jurisdictions, including Canada and the United States, we currently rely on a\nsingle third-party background check provider. In other jurisdictions, we rely on a very limited number of\nbackground check providers. If the need arises, and we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers\non terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform\nmay be less attractive to potential Dashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer\ndemand. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or\ndo not otherwise meet our expectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform\nand, as a result, we may be unable to adequately help protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and\nconsumers. Conversely, inaccurate background checks may inadvertently exclude qualified Dashers from our platform.\nAs a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be\nsubject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after\nthe third-party background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such criminal activity and this\nDasher may continue to have access to, and complete deliveries through, our platform.\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing\nDashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with\napplicable laws, rules, and regulations, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations\ncould be adversely affected, and we could face regulatory or legal action, including class, collective, or other\nrepresentative actions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including investigations, lawsuits,\ninquiries, and demand letters, related to our background check review process and the notice requirements around\nbackground checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in certain jurisdictions\nbased on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks\nadequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\nIn jurisdictions where there are no industry-specific regulations establishing standards for background checks, we\ndecide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks, in\naccordance with applicable laws and regulations. If we choose background checks that are less thorough in scope\nthan we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or regulation, or if we fail to run additional background\nchecks after Dashers are onboarded, we may face negative publicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to\nsafety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could\nadversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\nWe depend on the functionality of our platform across third-party software and services that we do not control.\nWe have integrations with PayPal, Stripe, Olo, Google Maps, AWS, and a variety of other third-party vendors. Third-\nparty software, applications, products, and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or\nmodify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings. Updates to third-party software that\nintegrates with our offerings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as it previously had or at\nall. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the\ninteroperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our\nability to operate and distribute our platform. Any changes in these systems that degrade the functionality of our\nplatform or give preferential treatment to competitive services could adversely affect usage of our platform.\nIn certain markets, we regularly engage fleet companies to fulfill deliveries on our platform. Fleet companies are\nthird parties that provide delivery services using their own workforce. Our operations in some markets may be\nheavily dependent on the services of fleet companies. To the extent that we do become reliant on fleet companies in\ncertain markets, it may be difficult to find a suitable replacement for the fulfillment services that such fleet\ncompanies provide in a\n73\nTable of Contents\ntimely manner or at all. In the event that our relationship with any of our key partners, including fleet\ncompanies, deteriorates, whether as a result of business disputes, regulatory issues, or degrading quality of\nservices, we may experience difficulties maintaining our operations in impacted markets, which could adversely\naffect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants,\nconsumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within\nsuch application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that\nreduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could\ndecline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application\nmarketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If\nsuch mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications\navailable to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications,\ngive preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose\nterms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us,\nor if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than\nthe placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms\nwill continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these\ndevices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed\nto work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful\nin developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’\nexperience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or\nusing our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating\nsystems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as\nwell as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about\nusers of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, in 2021, Apple imposed\nrequirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and implemented an application tracking\ntransparency framework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google\nannounced it planned to adopt restrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes\nhave, and we expect that these changes will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and\npromotions. If we are unable to mitigate the effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the\ngrowth of new users as well as order rates from existing consumers on our platform.\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear\nprominently in search results.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through Internet search results on search engines\nlike Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to how and\nwhere our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its\nranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not\nbe prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to\ninfluence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes\ntheir own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search\nengines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher\nadvertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of\nconsumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations.\n74\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition,\nand results of operations.\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our\nbusiness. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual\nrestrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property,\ntechnology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual\nproperty on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we\nshare information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent\nunauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not\nprovide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or\ntechnology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights,\nunauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain\nand use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or\nsuccessfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through\nvarious methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be\ninadequate.\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other\njurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may\ncontinue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly\nleading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims\nbrought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S.\nPatent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and\nabroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and\nscope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or\nregister our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce\nour proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which\ncould adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely\naffect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the\nfuture may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay\nsubstantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising\nfrom such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit\nor are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management\npersonnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble\ndamages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease\nmaking, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend\nadditional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or\nlicense agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if\nrequired, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license\nintellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do\nnot result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and\nresources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and\nresults of operations.\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from\nacquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand,\ntrademarks, or service marks.\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, such as www.doordash.com and\nwww.wolt.com. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the\napplicable registration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name,\nwhich could cause us substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain\nname in question. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names due to a variety of reasons. In addition, our\ncompetitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours.\nWe may be unable\n75\nTable of Contents\nto prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise\ndecrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting, maintaining, and enforcing our\nrights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of\nresources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the\nunderlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and\ndistribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open\nsource licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections\nregarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may\nmake it easier for others to compromise our platform.\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or\nmodified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the\nlicensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that\nsource code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our\nproprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source\nlicenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source\nsoftware license. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and\ntime and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected\nportions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and\nresources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software\nuntil we can adequately address the concerns.\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are\ndesigned to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be\neffective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not\nbeen interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way\nthat could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform.\nThere have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open\nsource software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of\nwhat we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the\nterms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be\nrequired to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on terms that are not\neconomically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-\nengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our\nproprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable\nterms, if at all.\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our\noperations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue\nto make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business\ngrowth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new\nplatform features and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure,\nacquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic conditions. We believe\nour working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months\nand beyond. We may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, or\ninvestments and our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-\nlinked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and\nany new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our\nClass A common stock. We may evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain\nfinancing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance\nand the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional\nfinancing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms\nsatisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to\nbusiness challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations\n76\nTable of Contents\nmay be adversely affected.\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our\noperational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our\nsubsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur subsidiary indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with\nother companies or sell substantially all of our assets and our subsidiaries' assets, taken as a whole, pay\ndividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments and loans, or engage in transactions with\naffiliates. We are also required to comply with a maximum senior net leverage ratio, measured quarterly, determined\nin accordance with the terms of the credit agreement. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our\ncurrent and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital\nneeds. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our\nbusiness strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies which are not subject to such\nrestrictions.\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result\nin an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments\nto provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility, to declare all borrowings outstanding, together\nwith accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable, and to require cash collateral for\nany outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility. If the debt under our revolving\ncredit facility were to be accelerated or such cash collateral were to be required, we may not have sufficient cash\nor be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which\ncould immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even\nif we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are\nacceptable to us. As of September 30, 2024, there were no revolving loans outstanding and $112 million in aggregate\nface amount of letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of\nconcentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of\ndirectors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for\napproval.\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C\ncommon stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the\nissued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of September 30, 2024, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief\nExecutive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of LaunchPad, and a member\nof our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of our board of\ndirectors collectively held 58% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate, which voting\npower may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards (including those\nequity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to our initial public offering and subject to equity exchange right\nagreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any shares\nof Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or the\nvesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of\nClass B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had\nbeen exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of September 30, 2024, our Co-Founders\nwould collectively hold 67% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-Founders have also entered\ninto the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and\nvote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and\npermitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will\nbe able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including\nthe election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws,\nand the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major\ncorporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you\ndisagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying,\npreventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to\nreceive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market\nprice of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause\nconflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in Mr. Xu undertaking,\nor causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or our Co-Founders but would not be\ndesirable for our other stockholders.\n77\nTable of Contents\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically\nconverting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected\nfor estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of\nClass B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by\nour board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the\nnumber of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common\nstock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr.\nXu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu\nand his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our initial public offering, which we\nsometimes refer to herein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total\ndisability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as\ndirected by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person,\nthen our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and\nno more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61\ndays and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an\nofficer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result\nof Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our\nstockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which\nsuch final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and\nrestated certificate of incorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date.\"\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per\nshare (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further\nstrategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers.\nOver time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders\nand this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of\nour total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting\npower, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the\noutcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would\nhave no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting\ndilution, which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common\nstock to Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares\nof Class C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has\nbeen met. As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s\ncontrol of our voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most\nmatters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our\nCo-Founders and, in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve\nliquidity in their holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C\ncommon stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of\nNasdaq.\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of Nasdaq, we\nexpect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain\nreduced corporate governance requirements.\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a\nmajority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2023, and Mr. Xu will have the\nauthority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs.\nFang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters\nto be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in\nthe listing standards of Nasdaq. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of the voting power for\nthe election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may\nelect not to comply with certain listing standards of Nasdaq regarding corporate governance, including requirements\nthat a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors, a compensation committee be composed of\nindependent directors, and that there is independent director oversight over the director nomination process.\nSuch corporate governance requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the\n“controlled company” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely\non these exemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing\nstandards of Nasdaq. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with\ncertain of the corporate governance standards of Nasdaq, which could adversely affect the protections for other\nstockholders.\n78\nTable of Contents\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to\nvarious factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of\nyour investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales\ncould occur;\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these\nestimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of\nour competitors or others in our industry;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\nactual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management;\ngeneral economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or\nnegative growth of our markets; and\nother events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public\nhealth concerns or epidemics, or responses to these events.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our\nmanagement’s attention and resources.\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our\nClass A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market\nprice of our Class A common stock. Certain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to\nrequire us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously\nregistered shares for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction\nof applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of\noutstanding RSU awards will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\n79\nTable of Contents\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a\ntime and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common\nstock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to\nrepurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock\nprice.\nIn February 2024, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our\nClass A common stock, in an aggregate amount of up to $1.1 billion. Under existing or any future share repurchase\nprograms, we may make share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share market purchases, block\ntransactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our\nshare repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares,\nand may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases,\nif any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal\nrequirements, such as Delaware surplus and solvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any\nfailure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and\ninvestor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would\nbe and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance\nlong-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common\nstock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could\nreduce the effectiveness of our repurchase programs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases\nin the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we\ngrant to our employees.\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital,\ncapital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements,\nand we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated\nbylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may\ndiscourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an\ninterested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an\ninterested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition,\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may\nmake the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\nany amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a\nmajority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\nour amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power\nof the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required\nfor stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\nour multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to\ndetermine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own\nsignificantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and\nClass C common stock;\nour board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and\ndirectors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\nuntil the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority\nof the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold\nDate”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or\napproved by our board of directors;\nafter the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders\nand will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\n80\nTable of Contents\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\nvacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by\nstockholders;\na special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief\nExecutive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\ncertain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\nour amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which\nmay be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\nadvance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring\nmatters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in\ncontrol of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for\nstockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any\nof which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for\ntheir shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay\nfor our Class A common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the\nexclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’\nability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative\nforum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or\nproceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of\nour directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any\nprovision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our\namended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs\ndoctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have\njurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having\njurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the\nfederal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and\nrestated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state\nor federal court, subject to applicable law.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The\nenforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in\nlegal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a\nprovision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the\nDelaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or\nunenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in\nother jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our\nmarket, or if they change their analysis regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading\nvolume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based\nupon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who\ncover us change their analysis regarding our Class A common stock adversely, publish more favorable analyses about\nour competitors than us, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our\nsecurities would likely decline.\n81\nTable of Contents\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate declaring or paying\nany dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility\ncontains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class\nA common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on\ntheir investment.\n82\nTable of Contents",
