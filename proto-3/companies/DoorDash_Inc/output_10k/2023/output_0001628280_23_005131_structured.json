              "content": "OUR BUSINESS\n\nOur mission is to grow and empower local economies. We aim to achieve this by providing logistics, technology, and other services that enable local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy.\n\nOur primary offerings include the DoorDash Marketplace, which operates in four countries including the United States, the Wolt Marketplace, which operates in 23 countries, and Platform Services. We built the DoorDash and Wolt Marketplaces (our \"Marketplaces\") to serve the needs of three key constituents: merchants, consumers, and the independent contractors who use our platform to generate earnings, or \"Dashers\". Our Marketplaces enable merchants to establish an online presence and expand their reach by connecting them with millions of consumers. Merchants can fulfill this demand through delivery, generally facilitated by our local logistics platform, or in-person pickup by consumers. As part of our Marketplaces, we offer merchants a broad array of services that enable them to solve mission-critical challenges such as customer acquisition and demand generation, order fulfillment, merchandising, payment processing, and customer support. We also enable merchants to advertise and promote on our platform in order to acquire new consumers and drive incremental sales.\n\nOur Marketplaces provide a platform for over 32 million monthly active users to discover, engage with, and purchase goods from merchants in their community. Our aim is to consistently improve our consumer value proposition by increasing the quantity and variety of merchants that are available on our Marketplaces, while also improving the level of convenience, quality, and service we provide. Our Marketplaces also offer our membership programs, DashPass and Wolt+, which aim to improve affordability and lower transactional friction by reducing the delivery and service fees we charge consumers. As of December 31, 2022, we had over 15 million DashPass and Wolt+ members.\n\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, which account for the vast majority of our revenue today, we offer several services on our platform (\"Platform Services\"), primarily consisting of DoorDash Drive and Wolt Drive (\"Drive\"), which are white-label delivery fulfillment services that enable merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our platform. Platform Services also includes DoorDash Storefront (\"Storefront\"), which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or logistics capabilities, and Bbot (\"Bbot\"), which offers merchants digital ordering and payment solutions for their in-store and online channels.\n\nFor Dashers, our Marketplaces and Platform Services provide opportunities for those looking for accessible and flexible ways to earn and achieve their goals. Dashers choose when and where to dash, as well as how frequently and for how long to dash each time they choose to do so.\n\nWe believe our business benefits only when we provide attractive services for each of our three key constituents: merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Consequently, in order to grow our business, we intend to provide merchants with a growing suite of services that help them build and grow their businesses; consumers with a broad selection of merchants and products to choose from, consistent and high-quality experiences, and affordability that drives increased adoption; and Dashers with an attractive combination of accessibility, flexibility, choice, and earning opportunity that competes effectively for their time.\n\nFootnotes:\n1. Dashers that use our DoorDash Marketplace and Wolt Marketplace are referred to as \"DoorDash Dashers\" and \"Wolt courier partners,\" respectively, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n2. Based on the number of individual consumer accounts that have completed an order on our Marketplaces in the past month, measured as of December 31, 2022.\n3. Excluding Wolt+ members, DashPass members were also over 15 million as of December 31, 2022.",
              "subsections": {
                "Competition": "The markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences, fragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. We compete for our constituencies on the following criteria:\n\n• Merchants. We compete for merchants based on our ability to generate consumer demand and the quality of our business enablement and demand fulfillment services. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the scale of our consumer base, the breadth of our demand fulfillment capabilities, and our broad array of services that enable merchants to solve mission-critical challenges.\n\n• Consumers. We compete for consumers based on a number of factors, including the selection of merchants and products available, the quality of the ordering, fulfillment and service experience, and affordability. We believe that we are positioned favorably based on the combination of merchant selection, experience, and value we provide.\n\n• Dashers. We compete to attract and retain Dashers based on a number of factors, including accessibility of our platform, flexibility in when, where, how much and how frequently to work, and earnings potential. We believe that we are well-positioned based on the limited requirements necessary to qualify, the density of our network, the improving efficiency of our platform, and the opportunities we provide Dashers to earn.\n\nLocal food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we compete with other local food delivery logistics platforms including Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway (including Grubhub, which it acquired in June 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online ordering systems, other merchants which own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, convenience and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. We also compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. With Drive, and as we continue to expand into other industry verticals beyond food, we expect to compete with large Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and market and brand power. As we continue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets.\n\nWe believe we compete favorably for merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our innovation, brand, and focused execution have allowed us to quickly extend our network and geographic reach and we plan to continue our efforts to expand within our existing markets and enter new markets and geographies in the future. For additional information about the risks to our business related to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.”",
                "Human Capital": "Employees\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had over 16,800 employees worldwide. We also engage contractors and consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe that our employee relations are strong.\n\nWe believe that people are at the core of every business. This drives our focus on improving the experiences of merchants, consumers, and Dashers, and it also drives how we think about our employees and the culture and values that we cultivate. Our employees are critical to our success.\n\nAt DoorDash, we grow and empower local economies. We give our team the freedom and opportunity to build the future—for our company, our constituencies, and our communities. Together, with grit, courage, and rapid innovation, we create the dynamic energy that drives our business forward.\n\nDashers\n\nWe are committed to make dashing an earnings opportunity that is accessible, flexible, and supportive of social progress. In 2022, well over 6 million people dashed (4), earning a total of over $13 billion.\n\nWe believe access and choice are empowering. Our goal with dashing is to provide as many people as we can with an opportunity to earn incremental income in a way that fits their lives. Since Dashers are independent contractors, we must compete for their time and effort with every order. We compete against other earning opportunities as well as alternative uses of time like doing errands or leisure. Because of this competition, we must make dashing attractive, worthwhile, and incremental to other choices available. Specifically, we strive to make dashing positive based on:\n\n• Accessibility: We believe the barriers-to-entry in dashing are very low. Where permitted by applicable law, prospective Dashers must pass a background check and, in most geographies, have access to a bike, scooter, or car. People who qualify to become Dashers are often eligible to begin generating income within a day of signing up. We know of no other earning opportunity that provides superior accessibility to dashing.\n\n• Flexibility: Once Dashers qualify, they choose whether to dash, where to dash, when to dash, how long to dash for, and how frequently to dash. This allows Dashers to scale their effort to their earning needs. It also allows Dashers to generate earnings around other commitments in their lives, which often include full or part-time jobs, school, parenting, or commitments to care for family or friends.\n\n• Earnings: Dashers dash in order to earn income, so we must provide earnings that are competitive with alternative opportunities and commensurate with Dashers' expectations. In addition to the absolute level of earnings, we provide tools that improve immediacy and accessibility of earnings, as this is often valued by Dashers.\n\n• Service: We aim to provide Dashers with high levels of service. This includes a dedicated service team that is accessible through our app, website, email, chat, and phone. We also provide visibility into our policies and practices for determining ratings and deactivations.\n\nOur mission to grow and empower local economies creates a culture that promotes progress in all of our stakeholder relationships. Just as importantly, our business cannot thrive, or even survive, without Dashers. As a result, our business and financial ambitions are well aligned with our goal to make dashing an attractive and incremental earning opportunity that promotes social progress by giving people more choice in how they achieve their financial goals.\n\nFootnote:\n4. Based on the number of Dasher accounts that have delivered an order through our platform in the past year, measured as of December 31, 2022.",
                "Our Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion": "At DoorDash, we are committed to growing and empowering inclusive communities in our company, our industry, and the geographies we serve. We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to helping us attract and retain the talent necessary to grow our business. We also believe we will be a more successful company if we amplify the voices of those who have not always been heard, and when everyone has “room at the table” and the tools, resources, and opportunities to succeed.\n\nSome of our diversity and inclusion programs at DoorDash include:\n\nElevate\n\nElevate is a program designed to increase the representation of women of color in leadership roles at our company. The year-long program starts with each member of our management team sponsoring fellows to serve on our leadership team, which exposes them to senior leadership and supports their development of business skills.\n\nEmployee Resource Groups\n\nWe support employee-led employee resource groups (\"ERGs\"), which foster a diverse and inclusive workplace. We currently have eight ERGs: Black@DoorDash, Unidos@DoorDash, Women@DoorDash, Pride@DoorDash (LGBTQIA+), AAPI@DoorDash (Asians, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders), Veterans@DoorDash, Indigenous@DoorDash, and Parents@DoorDash, all of which are open to people of all backgrounds.\n\nMitigating Bias Mandatory Training\n\nDuring our talent review cycles, we provide custom-designed training to all people managers, focused on educating leaders on unconscious bias, upskilling leaders on mitigation tactics, and creating accountability through a scaled Bias Busters Program to ensure every room has a voice dedicating to mitigating bias. A self-guided online training is mandatory for people managers of all levels, and a live, instructor-led training course with practical application exercises is mandatory for more senior leaders.",
                "Intellectual Property": "We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, patents, copyrights, trade secrets, license agreements, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.\n\nWe have invested in a patent program to identify and protect a substantial portion of our strategic intellectual property in logistics, selection optimization, and other technologies relevant to our business. As of December 31, 2022, we had 206 issued U.S. patents, 6 patents issued in foreign jurisdictions, 57 U.S. patent applications pending, and 19 patent applications pending in foreign jurisdictions. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property.\n\nWe have an ongoing trademark and service mark registration program pursuant to which we register our brand names and product names, taglines, and logos in the United States and other countries to the extent we determine appropriate and cost-effective. As of December 31, 2022, we held 44 registered trademarks in the United States and 122 registered trademarks in foreign jurisdictions. We also have common law rights in some trademarks and numerous pending trademark applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have registered domain names for websites that we use in our business, such as www.doordash.com and other variations.\n\nWe intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented, or challenged. For additional information, see the sections titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Intellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation” and “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property—Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.”",
                "Government Regulation": "We are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations in the United States and other jurisdictions. These laws, regulations, and standards govern issues such as worker classification, labor and employment, commissions and fees, anti-discrimination, payments, gift cards, whistleblowing and worker confidentiality obligations, product liability, environmental protection, personal injury, text messaging, membership services, intellectual property, consumer protection and warnings, marketing, taxation, privacy, data protection, data security, competition, unionizing and collective action, arbitration agreements and class action waiver provisions, terms of service, mobile application and website accessibility, money transmittal, and background checks. The sale and delivery of goods through our platform is also subject to laws, regulations, and standards that govern food safety, alcohol, tobacco, cannabidiol (CBD), pharmaceuticals and controlled substances, hazardous substances, and the interstate and intrastate transport of goods. These regulations are often complex and subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may change or develop over time through judicial decisions or as new guidance or interpretations are provided by regulatory and governing bodies, such as federal, national, state, and local administrative agencies.\n\nSee the sections titled “Risk Factors,” including the sections titled “—If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected,” “—Our business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims,” and “—We primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected,” for additional information about the laws and regulations we are subject to and the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.",

            "Item 1A. Risk Factors": {
              "content": "Investing in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the sections titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our Class A common stock. Our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could also be harmed by risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently do not believe are material. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.",
              "subsections": {
                "Risk Factors Summary": "Our business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, including those outside of our control, that could cause our actual results to be harmed. These risks include the following:\n\n• We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful;\n\n• We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future;\n\n• We may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates;\n\n• We face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected;\n\n• If we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\n\n• If we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\n\n• We rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain their service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely affected;\n\n• We expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance;\n\n• Systems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations;\n\n• If we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business, including in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected;\n\n• Our international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful;\n\n• If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected;\n\n• We are subject to various claims, lawsuits, investigations, and proceedings, and face potential liability, expenses, and harm to our business as a result;\n\n• Our business is subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally, including those related to worker classification, Dasher pay, and merchant pricing and commissions, many of which are unsettled and still developing, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to claims or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and subject us to legal claims;\n\n• The multi-class structure of our common stock and the voting agreement and irrevocable proxy (the \"Voting Agreement\"), between Tony Xu, Andy Fang, and Stanley Tang (the \"Co-Founders\"), has the effect of concentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval; and\n\n• The trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.",
                "Risks Related to Our Business and Operations": "We have a limited operating history in an evolving industry, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and may increase the risk that we will not be successful.\n\nWe launched operations in 2013 and we have since frequently expanded our platform features and services and changed our pricing methodologies. This limited operating history and our evolving business make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects and the risks and challenges we may encounter. These risks and challenges include our ability to:\n\n• accurately forecast our revenue and plan our operating expenses;\n\n• increase the number of and retain existing merchants, consumers, and Dashers using our platform;\n\n• successfully compete with current and future competitors;\n\n• successfully expand our business in existing markets and categories and enter new markets and categories;\n\n• successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses into our own, including in the case of our acquisition of Wolt;\n\n• anticipate and respond to macroeconomic changes and changes in the markets in which we operate, including with respect to inflation and other fluctuations in prices such as gasoline prices;\n\n• maintain and enhance the value of our reputation and brand;\n\n• adapt to rapidly evolving trends in the ways merchants and consumers interact with technology;\n\n• avoid interruptions or disruptions in our service;\n\n• develop and maintain a scalable, high-performance technology infrastructure that can efficiently and reliably handle increased usage, as well as the deployment and integration of new features, services, and technologies;\n\n• hire, integrate, motivate, and retain talented technology, sales, customer service, and other personnel;\n\n• effectively manage rapid growth in our personnel and operations; and\n\n• effectively manage our costs related to Dashers.\n\nIf we fail to address the risks and difficulties that we face, including those associated with the challenges listed above as well as those described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, because we have limited historical financial data and operate in a rapidly evolving market, any predictions about our future results of operations may not be as accurate as they would be if we had a longer operating history or operated in a more predictable market. We have encountered in the past, and will encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies with limited operating histories in rapidly changing industries. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan and operate our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our results of operations could differ materially from our expectations and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve, maintain, or increase profitability in the future.\n\nWe have incurred net losses in each year since our founding, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to achieve profitability, or maintain or increase profitability in the future. We incurred a net loss of $468 million and $1,365 million in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and, as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion and $3.8 billion. We expect our costs will increase over time and our losses to continue as we expect to invest significant additional funds towards growing our business and operating as a public company. We have expended and expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on developing our platform, including expanding our platform offerings, developing or acquiring new platform features and services, acquiring and integrating technologies and businesses, expanding into new markets and categories, and increasing our sales and marketing efforts. These efforts may be more costly than we expect and may not result in sufficient increased revenue or growth in our business to offset such costs. Any failure to increase our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses could prevent us from maintaining or increasing profitability or positive cash flow on a consistent basis. If we are unable to successfully address these risks and challenges as we encounter them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, the stock-based compensation expense related to our restricted stock units (\"RSUs\") and other outstanding equity awards will result in increased expenses in future periods. As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.8 billion of unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to RSUs and other outstanding equity awards. Additionally, we may expend substantial funds in connection with the tax withholding and remittance obligations that arise upon the initial settlement of certain of our RSUs.\n\nIf we are unable to generate adequate revenue growth and manage our expenses, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to achieve, maintain, or increase profitability.\n\nWe may not continue to grow on pace with historical rates.\n\nWe have grown rapidly over the last several years, and therefore our past revenue growth rate, growth in demand for our offerings, and financial performance should not necessarily be considered indicative of our future performance. During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021, we experienced a significant increase in revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV. In 2020 and 2021, our revenue was $2.9 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, representing a 69% year-over-year growth rate. In 2021 and 2022, our revenue was $4.9 billion and $6.6 billion, respectively, representing a 35% year-over-year growth rate. The circumstances that accelerated the growth of our business during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic are not likely to recur, and we expect growth in consumer demand and our revenue, Total Orders, and Marketplace GOV growth rates to continue to decline in future periods compared to growth rates in 2020 and 2021. You should not rely on our revenue or key business metrics for any previous quarterly or annual period as any indication of our revenue, revenue growth, key business metrics, or key business metrics growth in future periods.\n\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and it may continue to fluctuate over the short term and decline in the long term as the size of our business grows and as we achieve greater market adoption. We may also experience a declining revenue growth rate as a result of slowing demand for our platform, insufficient growth in the number of merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, increasing competition, a decrease in the growth of our overall market, our failure to capitalize on growth opportunities, and increasing regulatory costs. We also expect to continue to make investments in the development and expansion of our business, which may not result in sufficient revenue or growth to offset the cost of such investments. If our revenue growth rate declines, investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\n\nWe face intense competition and if we are unable to compete effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\nThe markets in which we operate are intensely competitive and characterized by shifting user preferences, fragmentation, and frequent introductions of new services and offerings. In particular, local food delivery logistics, the largest category of our business today, is fragmented and intensely competitive. Globally, we compete with other local on-demand delivery companies, such as Uber Eats, Just Eat Takeaway (including Grubhub, which it acquired in June 2021), and Delivery Hero, merchants that have their own online ordering platforms, online ordering systems, merchants that own and operate their own delivery fleets, grocers and grocery delivery services, convenience stores and convenience store delivery services, and companies that provide point of sale solutions and merchant delivery services. As we continue to expand to verticals beyond food, we may compete with large Internet companies with substantial resources, users, and market and brand power. In addition, we compete with traditional offline ordering channels, such as take-out offerings, telephone, and paper menus that merchants distribute to consumers as well as advertising that merchants place in local publications to attract consumers. Further, as we continue to expand our presence internationally, we will also face competition from local incumbents in these markets.\n\nOur current and future competitors may enjoy competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, greater category share in certain markets, market-specific knowledge, established relationships with local merchants and suppliers, larger existing user bases, more successful marketing capabilities, established geographic footprints and infrastructure, and substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we have. For example, with grocery delivery, we compete with established grocery chains that have strong bargaining power, established relationships with suppliers, and their own delivery fleets. Greater financial resources and product development capabilities may allow these competitors to respond more quickly and efficiently to new or emerging technologies and changes in merchant, consumer, and Dasher preferences that may render our platform less attractive or obsolete. If certain merchants choose to partner with our competitors in a specific geographic market, or if merchants choose to engage exclusively with our competitors, we may lack a sufficient variety and supply of merchant options or lack access to the most popular merchants, such that our offering would become less appealing to consumers. Our competitors may also make acquisitions or establish cooperative or other strategic relationships among themselves or with others, including merchants. For example, in July 2022, Grubhub announced a partnership with Amazon that allows Amazon Prime members in the United States to receive a free trial of Grubhub's membership program. Our competitors could also introduce new offerings with competitive price and performance characteristics or undertake more aggressive marketing campaigns than ours. Such efforts may lead us to lose category share or require us to increase our marketing expenses in order to maintain our category share.\n\nIn particular, our acquisition of Wolt and the expansion of the combined company may lead to an increase in competitive pressure from both existing competitors and new entrants in an already highly competitive industry. Through the acquisition, we have expanded our operations in Europe and Asia — regions that are already subject to intense competition in many of the categories in which we operate. As a result, existing competitors and any subsequent entrants in Europe and Asia may engage in aggressive consumer acquisition campaigns, develop superior offerings, or consolidate with other entities and achieve benefits of scale in response to our acquisition of Wolt. Such competitive pressures in an already highly competitive market may erode our category share, adversely impact our business, and increase the expenses associated with, or otherwise hinder, our expansion in both existing and new markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nMany of our competitors are well capitalized and offer discounted services, lower merchant commission rates and consumer fees, greater incentives for independent contractors who provide delivery services, consumer discounts and promotions, innovative platforms and offerings, and alternative pay models, any of which may be more attractive than those that we offer. Such competitive pressures may lead us to maintain or lower our commission rates and fees or maintain or increase our incentives, discounts, and promotions to remain competitive, particularly in markets where we are not in a leading position. Such efforts have negatively affected, and will continue to negatively affect, our financial performance, and there is no guarantee that such efforts will be successful. Further, the markets in which we compete have attracted significant investments from a wide range of funding sources, and we anticipate that many of our competitors will continue to be highly capitalized. These investments, along with the other competitive advantages discussed above, may allow our competitors to continue to lower their prices and fees, or increase the incentives, discounts, and promotions they offer, and compete more effectively against us. Local on-demand delivery services for food and the other verticals in which we compete are nascent, and we cannot guarantee that they will stabilize at a competitive equilibrium that will allow us to achieve, maintain or increase profitability. Further, merchants could determine that it is more cost effective to develop their own platforms to offer online pickup and delivery rather than use our platform.\n\nIt is relatively easy to switch between offerings in our industry. Consumers have a propensity to shift to the lowest-cost provider and could use more than one local commerce platform, independent contractors who provide delivery services could use multiple platforms concurrently as they attempt to maximize earnings, and merchants could prefer to use the local commerce platform that offers the lowest commission rates and adopt more than one platform to maximize their volume of orders. As we and our competitors introduce new offerings and as existing offerings evolve, we expect to become subject to additional competition. Our competitors may adopt certain of our platform features or may adopt innovations that merchants, consumers, or Dashers value more highly than ours, which would make our platform less attractive and more difficult to differentiate. Increased competition could result in, among other things, a reduction of the revenue we generate from the use of our platform, the number of platform users, the frequency of use of our platform, and our margins.\n\nFor all of these reasons, we may not be able to compete successfully. If we lose existing merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform, fail to attract new merchants, consumers, or Dashers, or are forced to reduce our commission rate or make pricing concessions as a result of increased competition, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\nIf we fail to retain our existing merchants and consumers or acquire new merchants and consumers in a cost-effective manner, our revenue, revenue growth, and margins may decrease and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe believe that growth of our business and revenue is dependent on our ability to continue to cost-effectively grow our platform by retaining our existing merchants and consumers and adding new merchants and consumers, including in new markets. The increase in merchants attracts more consumers to our platform and the increase in consumers attracts more merchants. This network takes time to build and may grow slower than we expect or slower than it has grown in the past. If we fail to retain either our existing merchants, especially our most popular merchants and our national brand partners, or consumers, the value of our network would be diminished. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses to acquire additional merchants and consumers. In expanding our operations into new markets to acquire additional merchants and consumers, we may be placed into unfamiliar competitive environments, and we may invest significant resources with the possibility that the return on such investments will not be achieved for several years or at all. We cannot assure you that the revenue from the merchants and consumers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquisition.\n\nIn addition, if merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, or face financial distress or other business disruption, or if our relationships with merchants on our platform deteriorate, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection. This risk is particularly pronounced with restaurants, as each year a significant percentage of restaurants go out of business, and in markets where we have fewer merchants. Similarly, if we are unsuccessful in attracting and retaining popular merchants, if merchants enter into exclusive arrangements with our competitors, if we fail to negotiate satisfactory terms with merchants, or if we ineffectively manage our relationships with merchants, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Our agreements with partner merchants generally remain in effect until terminated by partner merchants or us. Partner merchants may generally terminate their agreements with us by providing us at least seven or 30 days advance notice and such agreements do not generally provide for any exclusivity. In the event that our partner merchants terminate their agreements with us, the merchant selection available on our local commerce platform could be adversely affected. Changes to our business and to our relationships with some of our constituencies may also impact our ability to attract and retain other constituencies. For example, the increased growth of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+, and how compelling these offerings are to consumers, depends on our ability to sign up eligible merchants to our membership products. Additionally, many of our consumers initially access our platform to take advantage of certain promotions, such as discounts and other reduced fees. We strive to demonstrate the value of our platform and offerings to such consumers, thereby encouraging them to access our platform regularly or become a paid user of our membership products, through prompts and notifications and time-limited trials of our membership product and other offerings. However, these consumers may never convert to a paid membership of our membership products or access our platform after they take advantage of our promotions. If we are not able to expand our consumer base, convert our consumers to regular paying consumers, or increase the spending of our current consumer base on our platform, demand for our full-price or paid services, including DashPass and Wolt+, and our revenue may grow slower than expected or decline.\n\nFurther, certain consumers are indirect users of our platform, as they place orders through third-party websites and applications, such as Google, and merchant websites. Consumers may perceive these third-party websites and applications to be more efficient or user-friendly or have a stronger brand affinity to these third parties. If consumers increasingly use such third-party websites and applications to make orders on our platform, rather than through our websites and consumer mobile applications directly, our ability to establish relationships and build brand loyalty with consumers, collect information about consumer trends and preferences, and provide a customized experience based on such preferences would be adversely affected. This in turn could impact our ability to attract and retain consumers and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIf we fail to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers or to increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur continued growth depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively attract and retain Dashers who satisfy our screening criteria and procedures and to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers. Dashers have the ability to decline orders or stop using our platform entirely at any time and we do not have any exclusivity provisions with Dashers. Accordingly, if we do not continue to provide Dashers with flexibility on our platform and compelling opportunities to earn income, we may fail to attract new Dashers or retain existing Dashers or increase their use of our platform, or we may experience complaints, negative publicity, or work stoppages that could adversely affect our users and our business. Relatedly, If merchants and consumers choose to use competing offerings, we may lack sufficient opportunities for Dashers to earn, which may reduce the perceived utility of our platform and impact our ability to attract and retain Dashers. To attract and retain Dashers, we have, among other things, invested in making the use of our Dasher applications, and dashing, as frictionless as possible, created new ways for Dashers to earn and get paid, offered monetary incentives and perquisites, including credits to be used for orders on our platform, tips and assistance using the Dasher applications, and access to programs that provide cashback rewards on certain purchases, including gasoline. We also frequently test Dasher incentives with subsets of existing Dashers and potential Dashers, and these incentives could fail to attract and retain Dashers or fail to increase use of our platform by existing Dashers or could have other unintended adverse consequences, including negative press, adverse reactions from existing and potential Dashers, and harm to our brand and reputation. Changes in certain laws and regulations, including immigration and labor and employment laws, may result in a decrease in the pool of Dashers, which may result in increased competition for Dashers or higher costs of recruitment and engagement. Other factors outside of our control, such as increases in the price of gasoline, vehicles, or insurance, may also reduce the number of Dashers that utilize our platform or the use of our platform by Dashers. If we fail to attract Dashers, retain existing Dashers on favorable terms, or maintain or increase the use of our platform by existing Dashers, we may not be able to meet the demand of merchants and consumers and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely on merchants on our platform for many aspects of our business, and to the extent they fail to maintain their service levels or increase the prices they charge consumers on our platform, our business would be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely on merchants on our platform to provide quality goods to our consumers at expected price points. If these merchants experience difficulty servicing consumer demand, producing quality goods at affordable prices, meeting our requirements and standards, experience problems with their point-of-sale or other technologies, or choose to raise the prices of their goods on our platform for any other reason, our reputation and brand could be damaged. Further, an increase in merchant operating costs, or other deterioration in financial condition, whether due to inflation or otherwise, could cause merchants on our platform to raise prices, renegotiate commission rates, or cease operations, which could in turn adversely affect our revenue, operational costs, and efficiency. If merchants on our platform were to cease operations, temporarily or permanently, we may not be able to provide consumers with sufficient merchant selection, which we expect would reduce the number of consumers on our platform. Additionally, some items on our platform are listed at higher prices relative to their in-store prices. This practice can negatively affect consumer perception of our platform and could result in a decline in consumers or order volume, or both, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n\nWe expect a number of factors to cause our results of operations to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may make it difficult to predict our future performance.\n\nOur results of operations have historically varied from period to period, and we expect that our results of operations will continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our results of operations on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. In addition to other risk factors described elsewhere in this “Risk Factors” section, factors that may contribute to the variability of our quarterly and annual results include:\n\n• our ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform in a cost-effective manner;\n\n• our ability to accurately forecast revenue and appropriately plan expenses;\n\n• the effects of increased competition on our business;\n\n• our ability to successfully expand in existing markets and successfully enter new markets;\n\n• our ability to successfully integrate acquired technologies and businesses, including in the case of our acquisition of Wolt;\n\n• changes in consumer behavior with respect to on-demand delivery;\n\n• increases in marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that we may incur to grow and acquire new merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\n\n• our business mix between our Marketplaces and Platform Services;\n\n• the contribution to our overall business of our membership products, DashPass and Wolt+;\n\n• the impact of worldwide economic conditions, including the resulting effect on consumer spending on on-demand delivery;\n\n• the seasonality of our business, including the effect of academic calendars on college campuses and seasonal patterns in restaurant dining;\n\n• the impact of weather on our business;\n\n• our ability to maintain an adequate rate of growth and effectively manage that growth;\n\n• our ability to maintain and increase traffic to our platform;\n\n• the contribution to our overall business of our advertising products and services, including the effect that market conditions may have on our ability to sell these products and services;\n\n• the effects of changes in search engine placement and prominence;\n\n• our ability to keep pace with technology changes in our industry;\n\n• the success of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\n• the effects of negative publicity on our business, reputation, or brand;\n\n• our ability to protect, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property;\n\n• costs associated with defending claims, including intellectual property infringement claims, and related judgments or settlements;\n\n• changes in governmental or other regulations affecting our business, including regulations regarding the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform and regulations impacting the commission rates we charge to merchants;\n\n• interruptions in service and any related impact on our business, reputation, or brand;\n\n• the effects of natural or human-made catastrophic events;\n\n• the effects of outbreaks of contagious disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the response of governments and private industry;\n\n• the impact of price controls that may be imposed by various jurisdictions, and any associated increase in the fees we may have to impose to offset such price controls;\n\n• the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting;\n\n• the impact of payment processor costs and procedures;\n\n• changes in the online payment transfer rate; and\n\n• changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\n\nThe variability and unpredictability of our results of operations could result in our failure to meet our expectations or those of analysts that cover us or investors with respect to revenue or other results of operations for a particular period. If we fail to meet or exceed such expectations, the market price of our Class A common stock could fall substantially, and we could face costly lawsuits, including securities class action suits.\n\nSystems failures and resulting interruptions in the availability of our websites, mobile applications, or platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIt is critical to our success that merchants, consumers, and Dashers be able to access our platform at all times. Our systems, or those of third parties upon which we rely, may experience service interruptions or degradation or other performance problems because of hardware and software defects or malfunctions, distributed denial-of-service and other cyberattacks, infrastructure changes, human error, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, fires, natural disasters, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, fraud, military or political conflicts, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, or other events. Our systems also may be subject to break-ins, sabotage, theft, and intentional acts of vandalism, including by our own employees. It may become increasingly difficult and expensive to maintain and improve the performance of our systems and the availability of our platform, especially during peak usage times, as our operations grow and the usage of our platform increases. Some of our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of systems failures and similar events.\n\nWe have experienced and will likely continue to experience system failures and other events or conditions from time to time that interrupt the availability or reduce or affect the speed or functionality of our platform. These events have resulted in losses in revenue in the past and in the future could result in significant losses of revenue and may harm our brand and reputation. Moreover, we have in the past voluntarily provided credits to consumers on our platform to compensate them for the inconvenience caused by a system failure or similar event, including for orders that are delivered late or orders that are cancelled by us or the merchant, and may voluntarily provide similar such credits in the future. In addition, affected users could seek monetary recourse from us for their losses and such claims, even if unsuccessful, would likely be time-consuming and costly for us to address. Further, in some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. A prolonged interruption in the availability or reduction in the availability, speed, or other functionality of our platform could adversely affect our business and reputation and could result in the loss of users.\n\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions and investments, or successfully integrate acquisitions into our business, including in the case of our acquisition of Wolt, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nAs part of our business strategy, we will continue to consider a wide array of strategic transactions, including acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, intellectual property, services, and other assets and arrangements that complement our business. For example, on May 31, 2022, we completed the acquisition of Wolt. We have previously acquired and invested in, and continue to evaluate, targets that operate in relatively nascent markets and there is no assurance that such acquired businesses, or any investment or strategic transaction that we enter into, will be successfully integrated into our business, generate revenue, or achieve any expected benefits on a timely basis or at all.\n\nAcquisitions and similar strategic transactions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations, including:\n\n• intense competition for suitable acquisition and strategic transaction targets, which could increase prices and adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms;\n\n• transaction-related lawsuits or claims;\n\n• difficulties associated with managing a larger, more complex, combined company;\n\n• difficulties integrating the technologies, operations, including compensation structures, existing contracts, and personnel of an acquired business;\n\n• difficulties retaining, integrating, and motivating key employees or business partners of an acquired business, and difficulties retaining or motivating our existing key employees or business partners after an acquisition;\n\n• difficulties retaining merchants, consumers, and Dashers, as applicable, of an acquired business;\n\n• challenges integrating accounting, finance, and forecasting practices of acquired businesses with our own, especially in the context of international businesses;\n\n• challenges relating to the structure of an investment, such as governance, accountability, operations, expense sharing, and decision-making conflicts that may arise in the context of a joint venture or other majority ownership investments;\n\n• challenges with integrating the brand identity of an acquired company with our own;\n\n• difficulties in operating a geographically dispersed organization, including as a result of different time zones, languages, and cultural, political, and business practices;\n\n• currency, regulatory, and compliance risks associated with foreign jurisdictions and entry into new markets;\n\n• diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition or investment opportunities;\n\n• the need to implement internal controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger, U.S.-based public company like ours at companies we may acquire that prior to acquisition may not have robust controls, procedures, and policies, in particular, with respect to the effectiveness of internal controls, cyber and information security practices, incident response plans, and business continuity and disaster recovery plans, compliance with privacy, data protection, information security, and other regulations, and compliance with U.S.-based economic policies and sanctions which may not have previously been applicable to the acquired company’s operations;\n\n• failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction;\n\n• failure to identify the problems, liabilities, or other shortcomings or challenges of an investment or acquired business, technology, or asset, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, litigation, information security vulnerabilities, trust and safety practices, brand management, revenue recognition or other accounting practices, or employee or user issues;\n\n• the enactment of new laws or regulations that are adverse to an investment or acquired business, or impede our ability to achieve the expected benefits of such investments;\n\n• regulatory challenges from antitrust or other regulatory authorities that may block, delay, or impose conditions (such as divestitures, ownership, or operational restrictions or other structural or behavioral remedies) on the completion of transactions or the integration of acquired businesses;\n\n• an acquired business or investment in new technologies, products, or services cannibalizing a portion of our existing business;\n\n• additional stock-based compensation issued or assumed in connection with an acquisition or strategic transaction, which may in turn impact our stock price and results of operations;\n\n• as a result of an acquisition, third parties we or an acquired business works with may delay or defer certain business decisions, seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or the acquired business, or consider working with a competitor instead; and\n\n• adverse market reaction to an acquisition, particularly if we are unable to achieve any expected benefits in our results of operation, or if the anticipated benefits are not realized as rapidly or to the extent anticipated or if the transaction costs are greater than expected.\n\nIn particular, the ongoing integration of Wolt into our business poses heightened risks, including write-offs or restructuring charges, unanticipated costs, regulatory and compliance risk associated with operating in a number of new jurisdictions, operational difficulties, and the loss of key employees. There can be no assurance that the integration will be accomplished effectively or in a timely manner. In addition, the integration of Wolt will subject us to liabilities that may exist at Wolt or may arise in connection with the completion of the acquisition, some of which may be unknown. Although we and our advisers have conducted due diligence on the operations of Wolt and we have certain rights of indemnification, including an escrow of acquisition consideration to secure certain obligations of Wolt's securityholders, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of Wolt or that the amounts in escrow will be sufficient. Further, the escrow consists of shares and therefore, even if we are able to recover from the escrow, we will need to use our cash and resources to pay for the liabilities and damages. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to the acquisition not currently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial or unlikely to occur, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations, including our profitability.\n\nWe have made and may continue to make strategic investments as part of our business strategy. For example, in October 2021, we closed a $395 million investment in preferred shares of a private grocery delivery platform company based in Europe. Strategic investments inherently involve less control over business operations of the investee, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, regulatory, and/or compliance risks associated with the joint venture or strategic investment. In addition, we may be dependent on partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them and who may have business interests, strategies, or goals that are inconsistent or competitive with ours. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of the partners, controlling shareholders, management, or other persons or entities who control them may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us, and may otherwise damage our reputation and brand. Our ability to sell or transfer, or realize value from our investments may be limited by applicable securities laws and regulations. Entry into certain transactions with foreign entities now or in the future may be subject to government regulations, including review related to foreign direct investment by U.S. or foreign government entities. If a transaction with a foreign entity is subject to regulatory review, such regulatory review might limit our ability to enter into the desired strategic alliance and thus our ability to carry out our long-term business strategy. We can provide no assurance that our strategic investments will generate returns for our business, or that we will not lose our initial investment in whole or in part. For example, during the quarter ended December 31, 2022, in the course of evaluating our investments, we determined impairment indicators existed for a previously disclosed investment in a grocery delivery platform company. Following a valuation of this investment, we incurred an impairment of $312 million associated with our non-marketable equity securities.\n\nIf we fail to address the foregoing risks or other problems encountered in connection with past or future acquisitions of, and investments in, businesses, technologies, services, intellectual property, and other assets and arrangements and investments, or if we fail to successfully integrate or otherwise realize the benefits of such acquisitions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nOur international operations and any future international expansion will subject us to additional costs and risks and our plans may not be successful.\n\nWe have significant international operations, and we expect to continue to make significant investments in non-U.S. markets as part of our growth strategy. We launched our platform in Canada in 2015, Australia in 2019, Japan and Germany in 2021, and New Zealand in 2022. We continued our expansion in Europe and Asia through our acquisition of Wolt in 2022, which brings the number of countries that we operate in outside the United States to 26. Our operations outside of the United States require significant operating expenses and management attention in order to oversee operations over broad geographic areas with varying regulations, cultural norms, and customs, in addition to placing strain on our finance, analytics, compliance, legal, engineering, and operations teams. Our current international operations and our plans for investment in non-U.S. markets subject us to a number of risks and we may not be successful in our international operations for a variety of reasons, including:\n\n• an inability to recruit and retain talented and capable employees in foreign countries and maintain our company culture across all of our offices;\n\n• an inability to attract merchants, consumers, and Dashers;\n\n• competition from local incumbents that better understand the local market, may market and operate more effectively, and may enjoy greater local affinity or awareness;\n\n• differing demand dynamics, which may make our platform less successful;\n\n• difficulty localizing, or an inability to localize, services for merchants, Dashers, and consumers in non-U.S. markets;\n\n• complying with varying laws and regulatory standards across jurisdictions, including with respect to labor and employment, data privacy, data protection, tax, export control and sanctions, public health, payment processing, transactions, and local regulatory restrictions;\n\n• increased financial accounting and reporting requirements and complexities, including with respect to revenue recognition and similar accounting principles;\n\n• difficulties with communication and information sharing as a result of communication barriers, cultural norms and customs, and differing legal, compliance, trust and safety, accounting, and financial standards, especially as it relates to compliance with laws, internal controls and processes, and financial reporting;\n\n• adverse tax consequences, including the complexities of foreign value added and digital services tax systems, and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\n• unique and varying terms and conditions in contract negotiations across jurisdictions;\n\n• varying payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable;\n\n• obtaining any required government approvals, licenses, or other authorizations;\n\n• varying levels of Internet and mobile technology adoption and infrastructure;\n\n• currency exchange restrictions or costs;\n\n• operating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights in the same manner or to the same extent as the United States;\n\n• public health concerns or emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and other highly communicable diseases or viruses, outbreaks of which have from time to time occurred, and which may occur, in various parts of the world in which we operate or may operate in the future; and\n\n• limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds as well as foreign currency exchange restrictions.\n\nOur limited experience in operating our business internationally increases the risk that any potential future expansion efforts that we may undertake may not be successful. If we invest substantial time and resources to expand our operations internationally and are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. In addition, international expansion may subject our business to broader economic, political, and other international risks, including economic volatility, security risks, and geopolitical conflicts, and may increase our risks in complying with various laws and standards, including with respect to anti-corruption, anti-bribery, export controls, and trade and economic sanctions such as U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctions and similar European Union (\"EU\") sanctions. For example, the civil unrest in Kazakhstan required Wolt to temporally suspend its business operations in the country due to safety and security concerns, as well as the unavailability of, and significant disruptions to, Internet service. While we have been able to resume business operations in Kazakhstan, such events may occur in the future in other countries or regions leading to similar disruptions. In addition, Wolt's operations in markets that are in close proximity to Russia increases the difficulty in complying with trade and economic sanction regimes related to business with Russia.",
                "Risks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment": "If Dashers that utilize our platform are reclassified as employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, our business, financial condition, and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\nWe are subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the U.S. federal, state, and municipal levels, as well as in jurisdictions in Europe and Asia, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. The tests governing whether a Dasher is an independent contractor or an employee vary by governing law and are typically highly fact intensive. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to changes and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us, as well as the Dashers, merchants, and consumers that use our platform. For example, in October 2022, the U.S Department of Labor released a proposed rule regarding the classification of employees and independent contractors under the federal Fair Labor Standards Act. The proposed rule would implement new interpretative guidance for classification of workers. We maintain that Dashers that utilize our platform are properly classified as independent contractors. However, Dashers may be reclassified as employees, especially in light of the evolving rules and restrictions on worker classification and their potential impact on the local commerce industry. A reclassification of Dashers as employees would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including as a result of:\n\n• monetary exposure arising from, or relating to, failure to withhold and remit taxes, unpaid wages and wage and hour laws and requirements (such as those pertaining to failure to pay minimum wage and overtime, or to provide required breaks and wage statements), expense reimbursement, statutory and punitive damages, penalties, including related to California Labor Code Private Attorneys General Act (“PAGA”) and government fines;\n• injunctions prohibiting continuance of existing business practices;\n\n• claims for employee benefits, social security, workers’ compensation, and unemployment;\n\n• claims of discrimination, harassment, and retaliation under civil rights laws;\n\n• claims under laws pertaining to unionizing, collective bargaining, and other concerted activity;\n\n• other claims, charges, or other proceedings under laws and regulations applicable to employers and employees, including risks relating to allegations of joint employer liability or agency liability; and\n\n• harm to our reputation and brand.\n\nIn addition to the harms listed above, a reclassification of Dashers as employees would require us to significantly alter our existing business model and operations and impact our ability to add and retain Dashers to our platform and grow our business, which we would expect to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe have been involved in and continue to be involved in numerous legal proceedings related to Dasher classification, and such proceedings have increased in volume since the California Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling in Dynamex. We are currently involved in a number of putative class actions and representative actions brought, for example, pursuant to PAGA, and numerous individual claims, including those brought in arbitration or compelled pursuant to the terms of our independent contractor agreements to arbitration, challenging the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed a claim against us in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees. For more details on this action, please see the section titled \"Legal Proceedings\" above in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nSome jurisdictions in the United States, Europe, and Asia have modified, or are considering modifying, their standards used to determine worker classification. For example, the California Legislature passed Assembly Bill (\"AB 5\") and it was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on September 18, 2019 and became effective on January 1, 2020. AB 5 codified the Dynamex standard regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for Proposition 22 (“Proposition 22”) to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, on August 20, 2021, the Alameda County Superior Court in California issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General and other groups and individuals appealed to the California Court of Appeal. To the extent Proposition 22 remains in effect, certain provisions regarding compensation, along with certain other requirements, are applicable to us and Dashers in California. These provisions have increased our costs related to Dashers in California. To offset a portion of these increased costs, in certain circumstances we charge higher fees and commissions, which could result in lower order volumes over time. Depending on whether and how much we choose to increase fees and commissions, these increased costs could also lead to a lower Net Revenue Margin, which we referred to in past SEC filings as Take Rate, defined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV. The provisions resulting from Proposition 22 that are now applicable to us include, but are not limited to, (i) net earnings (which excludes tips, tolls, and certain other amounts) to Dashers no less than a net earnings floor equal to (A) 120% of the minimum wage for a Dasher’s engaged time and (B) for Dashers using a motor vehicle, $0.30 per engaged mile (which amount shall be adjusted for inflation in future years) and (ii) for Dashers averaging at least 15 hours per week of engaged time during a calendar quarter who subscribe to a qualifying health plan, payments to such Dashers of healthcare subsidies of varying dollar amounts depending on a Dasher’s engaged time per week. As such, Proposition 22 has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our results of operations.\n\nSeveral other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, that would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase. We may also experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if it becomes necessary to charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation. For example, certain plaintiffs filed a claim in California Superior Court challenging the constitutionality of Proposition 22, which resulted in the Alameda County Superior Court’s order finding the entirety of Proposition 22 unenforceable. If Dashers are determined to be employees under U.S. federal or state law, or the laws of other jurisdictions in which we operate, including as a result of litigation, this could result in increases to our costs related to Dashers, which would likely lead us to increase fees and commissions and may result in lower order volumes, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to local regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent contractors. For example, on November 1, 2021, the Finnish Occupational Safety and Health Administration (through the Division at the Regional State Administrative Agency for Southern Finland) issued a decision which deemed that Wolt courier partners in Finland are in an employment relationship with Wolt, and that Wolt should be mandated to keep statutory records of Wolt courier partners' working hours. We have appealed the decision to the Administrative Court of Hämeenlinna. In addition, other jurisdictions are considering changing the standards used to determine worker classification, which may impact our classification of Dashers using our platform. For example, the EU is considering new criteria for determining worker classification, which could be adopted by member states. Any potential EU-wide legislative reform may adversely affect our ability to operate our current independent contractor model within the EU.\n\nIn certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, we may decide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result in certain operational challenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain jurisdictions or decide not to expand our business in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion opportunities.",
                "Risks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties": "We rely primarily on third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to insure our operations-related risks. If our insurance coverage is insufficient for the needs of our business or our insurance providers are unable to meet their obligations, we may not be able to mitigate the risks facing our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe procure third-party insurance policies from a limited number of insurance providers to cover various operations-related risks including auto liability, employment practices liability, workers’ compensation, business interruptions, cybersecurity and data breaches, crime, directors’ and officers’ liability, occupational accident liability for Dashers, and general business liabilities. For certain types of operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services, we may not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire insurance. Even if we do acquire insurance for our operations-related risks or risks related to our new and evolving services, we may not obtain enough insurance to adequately mitigate such risks, and we may have to pay high premiums, self-insured retentions, or deductibles for the coverage we do obtain. If any of our insurance providers becomes insolvent, it would be unable to pay any operations-related claims that we make. In addition, if any of our insurance providers terminate their relationship with us or refuse to renew their relationships with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate insurance providers and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, some of our agreements with merchants require that we procure certain types of insurance, and if we are unable to obtain and maintain such insurance, we would be in violation of the terms of these merchant agreements and could be subject to additional liabilities as a result.\n\nIf the amount of one or more operations-related claims were to exceed our applicable aggregate coverage limits, we would be responsible for the excess, in addition to amounts already incurred in connection with deductibles, self-insured retentions, or otherwise paid by our insurance subsidiary. Insurance providers have raised premiums and deductibles for many businesses and may do so in the future. As a result, our insurance and claims expense could increase substantially, or we may decide to raise our deductibles or self-insured retentions when our policies are renewed or replaced. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if (i) the cost per claim, premiums, or the number of claims significantly exceeds our historical experience and coverage limits, (ii) we experience a claim in excess of our coverage limits, (iii) our insurance providers fail to pay on our insurance claims, (iv) we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided, or (v) the number of claims under our deductibles or self-insured retentions differs from historical averages.\n\nWe primarily rely on Amazon Web Services to deliver our services to users on our platform, and any disruption of or interference with our use of Amazon Web Services could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe primarily host our platform and support our operations on data centers provided by Amazon Web Services (“AWS”), a third-party provider of cloud infrastructure services, in a limited number of locations. We do not have control over the operations of the AWS facilities that we use. AWS’s facilities are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages, and similar events or acts of misconduct. We have experienced, and expect that in the future we will continue to experience, interruptions, delays, and outages in service and availability from time to time due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In addition, any changes in AWS’ service levels may adversely affect our ability to meet the requirements of users on our platform. Any negative publicity arising from these disruptions could harm our reputation and brand. Since our platform’s continuing and uninterrupted performance is critical to our success, sustained or repeated system failures would reduce the attractiveness of our platform, usage of our platform, lead to loss of revenue, increase our costs, and impair our ability to attract new users, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur primary commercial agreement with AWS will remain in effect until terminated by AWS or us. AWS may terminate the agreement for convenience by providing us at least 30 days advanced notice. AWS may also terminate the agreement for cause upon a material breach of the agreement, subject to AWS providing prior written notice and a 30-day cure period, and may in some cases terminate the agreement immediately for cause upon written notice. Although it would be difficult for a number of reasons, we believe that we could transition to one or more alternative cloud infrastructure providers on commercially reasonable terms if it became necessary. In the event that our agreement with AWS is terminated or we add additional cloud infrastructure service providers, we may experience significant costs or downtime for a short period in connection with the transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers. However, we do not believe that such transfer to, or the addition of, new cloud infrastructure service providers would cause substantial harm to our business, financial condition, or results of operations over the longer term.\n\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, and if we cannot manage our relationship with such third parties and other payment-related risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe primarily rely on a third-party payment processor, Stripe, to process payments made to merchants and Dashers and a small number of third-party payment processors to process payments made by consumers, primarily PayPal and Stripe. Under our commercial agreements with Stripe and PayPal, each of these parties may terminate our relationship with advanced notice. If both Stripe and PayPal terminate their relationship with us or refuse to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would be required to find alternate payment processors and may not be able to secure similar terms or a suitable replacement in an acceptable time frame. Further, the software and services provided by a replacement for Stripe or PayPal may not meet our expectations, may contain errors or vulnerabilities, and could be compromised or experience outages. Any of these risks could cause us to lose our ability to accept online payments or other payment transactions, verify payment information, or make timely payments to merchants and Dashers, any of which could disrupt our business for an extended period of time, make our platform less convenient and attractive to users, result in losses and legal liability to us, and adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified merchants, consumers, and Dashers.\n\nIf we fail to or are alleged to fail to comply with applicable payment, payment processing, anti-money laundering, and similar regulations as a result of our relationships with our third-party payment processors, we may be subject to claims and litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, civil or criminal penalties, fines, or higher transaction fees and may lose the ability to accept online payments or other payment card transactions, which could make our platform less convenient and attractive to consumers. We also rely on data provided by Stripe and other payment service provider partners for financial statement reporting, and there could be inaccuracies and other errors in such data. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our primary third-party payment processor requires us to comply with payment card network operating rules, which are set and interpreted by the payment card networks. The payment card networks could adopt new operating rules or interpret or re-interpret existing rules in ways that might prohibit us from providing certain services to some users, be costly to implement, or difficult to follow. If we fail to comply with these rules or regulations, we may be subject to fines and higher transaction fees and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from consumers or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. We have also agreed to reimburse our third-party payment processor for any reversals, chargebacks, and fines they are assessed by payment card networks if we violate these rules. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe rely on third-party background check providers to screen potential Dashers and if such providers fail to provide accurate information or we are not able to maintain business relationships with them, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWhere permitted under applicable law, we rely on third-party background check providers to provide the criminal and/or driving records of potential Dashers and, in some cases, existing Dashers to help identify those that are not qualified to use our platform pursuant to applicable law or our internal standards, and our business may be adversely affected to the extent such providers do not meet their contractual obligations, our expectations, or the requirements of applicable law or regulations. If any of our third-party background check providers terminates its relationship with us or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we may need to find an alternate provider, and may not be able to secure similar terms or replace such partners in an acceptable time frame. In certain jurisdictions, including the United States, we rely on a single third-party background check provider. If we cannot find alternate third-party background check providers on terms acceptable to us, we may not be able to timely onboard potential Dashers, and as a result, our platform may be less attractive to potential Dashers and we may have difficulty finding enough Dashers to meet consumer demand. Further, if the background checks conducted by our third-party background check providers are inaccurate or do not otherwise meet our expectations, unqualified Dashers may be permitted to make deliveries on our platform, and as a result, we may be unable to adequately protect or provide a safe environment for our merchants and consumers and qualified Dashers may be inadvertently excluded from our platform. As a result of inaccurate background checks, our reputation and brand could be adversely affected and we could be subject to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. In addition, if a Dasher engages in criminal activity after the third-party background check has been conducted, we may not be informed of such criminal activity and this Dasher may be permitted to continue making deliveries on our platform.\n\nWe are also subject to a number of laws and regulations applicable to background checks for potential and existing Dashers that utilize our platform. If we or our third-party background check providers fail to comply with applicable laws, rules, and legislation, our reputation, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and we could face legal action, including class, collective, or other representative actions. For example, we have faced issues in the past, including lawsuits and demand letters, related to notice requirements around background checks. In addition, background check qualification processes may be limited in certain jurisdictions based on national and local laws, and our third-party service providers may fail to conduct such background checks adequately or disclose information that could be relevant to a determination of eligibility.\n\nIn jurisdictions where our industry does not have regulations establishing standards for background checks, we decide on the scope of our background checks and the cadence with which we conduct such background checks. By choosing background checks that are less thorough in scope than we are permitted to conduct under applicable law or regulation, or by failing to run additional background checks after Dashers are on-boarded, we may face negative publicity or become subject to litigation in the future.\n\nAny negative publicity related to any of our third-party background check providers, including publicity related to safety incidents or actual or perceived privacy or data security breaches or other security incidents, could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure. Any of the foregoing risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe rely on third parties to provide some of the software for our platform. If such third parties interfere with the distribution of our platform or with our use of such software, our business would be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely upon certain third parties to provide software for our platform. For example, we use Google Maps for the mapping function that is critical to the functionality of our platform, and accordingly, we do not control all mapping functions employed by our platform or Dashers using our platform, and it is possible that such mapping functions may not be reliable. Any failure by us to understand and manage our exposure to the risks associated with the use of third party software, such as the risk of misuse of confidential or proprietary information or the exposure to cybersecurity incidents, could adversely impact us. For example, integration issues could prevent the onboarding of new third party software providers or lead to the loss of existing providers. Furthermore, updates to third party software that integrates with our offerings could cause our platform to not operate as efficiently as it previously had or at all. Any changes in these systems that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to competitive services may impose could adversely affect usage of our platform. From time to time we have had, and may in the future have, disputes with certain of our third-party software providers. If, in connection with such a dispute, a software provider terminates its relationship with us or otherwise limits the provision of their software to us, the availability or usage of our platform could be disrupted. If the third parties we rely upon cease to provide access to the third-party software that we and Dashers use, whether in connection with disputes or otherwise, do not provide access to such software on terms that we believe to be attractive or reasonable, or do not provide us with the most current version of such software, we may be required to seek comparable software from other sources, which may be more expensive or inferior, or may not be available at all, any of which would adversely affect our business.\n\nWe depend on the interoperability of our platform across third-party applications and services that we do not control.\n\nWe have integrations with PayPal, Stripe, Twilio, Olo, Google Maps, AWS, and a variety of other vendors. Third-party applications, products, and services are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to maintain or modify our platform to ensure its compatibility with third-party offerings following development changes. In addition, some of our competitors or merchants on our platform may take actions that disrupt the interoperability of our platform with their own products or services, or exert strong business influence on our ability to, and the terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform. As our platform evolves, we expect the types and levels of competition we face to increase. Should any of our competitors or merchants on our platform modify their technologies, standards, or terms of use in a manner that degrades the functionality or performance of our platform or is otherwise unsatisfactory to us or gives preferential treatment to our competitors’ products or services, our platform, business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe rely on mobile operating systems and application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers. If our applications do not effectively operate with or receive favorable placements within such application marketplaces or if the mobile operating system providers make changes to their platforms that reduce the functionality of our platform or effectiveness of our advertising, our usage or brand recognition could decline and our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nWe depend in part on mobile operating systems, such as Android and iOS, and their respective application marketplaces to make our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform. If such mobile operating systems or application marketplaces limit or prohibit us from making our applications available to merchants, consumers, and Dashers, make changes that degrade the functionality of our applications, give preferential treatment to our competitors’ applications, increase the cost of using our applications, impose terms of use unsatisfactory to us, or modify their search or ratings algorithms in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors’ placement in such mobile operating systems’ application marketplace is more prominent than the placement of our applications, our user growth could slow.\n\nAs new mobile devices and mobile platforms are released, there is no guarantee that these new devices and platforms will continue to support our platform or that we will be able to maintain the same level of service on these devices and platforms. In order to deliver effective applications, we need to ensure that our platform is designed to work effectively with a range of mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards. We may not be successful in developing or maintaining relationships with key participants in the mobile industry that enhance users’ experience. If merchants, consumers, or Dashers that utilize our platform encounter any difficulty accessing or using our applications on their mobile devices or if we are unable to adapt to changes in popular mobile operating systems, we expect that our user growth and user engagement would be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and Google, have announced changes as well as future plans to limit the ability of application developers like us to collect and use certain data about users of our platform, including merchants, consumers, and Dashers. For example, Apple has imposed new requirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and has implemented a new application tracking transparency framework that requires opt-in consent for certain types of tracking. In February 2022, Google announced it planned to adopt restrictions to restrict tracking activity across Android devices. These changes have, and we expect that these changes will continue to, negatively impact the effectiveness of our advertising and promotions. If we are unable to mitigate the effects of these developments, we could experience a decline in the growth of new users as well as order rates from existing consumers on our platform.\n\nInternet search engines drive traffic to our platform and our new user growth could decline if we fail to appear prominently in search results.\n\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract consumers through unpaid Internet search results on search engines like Google. The number of consumers we attract to our platform from search engines is due in large part to how and where our websites rank in unpaid search results. These rankings can be affected by a number of factors, many of which are not under our direct control and may change frequently. For example, a search engine may change its ranking algorithms, terms of service, methodologies, or design layouts. As a result, links to our websites may not be prominent enough to drive traffic to our websites, and we may not know how or otherwise be in a position to influence the results. In some instances, search engine companies may change these rankings in a way that promotes their own competing products or services or the products or services of one or more of our competitors. Search engines may also adopt a more aggressive auction-pricing system for keywords that would cause us to incur higher advertising costs or reduce our market visibility to prospective consumers. Any reduction in the number of consumers directed to our platform could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on information from third-party sources and we do not independently verify the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such sources or the methodologies for collecting such data, and any real or perceived inaccuracies in such estimates and information may harm our reputation and adversely affect our business.\n\nCertain estimates and information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including general expectations concerning our industry and the market in which we operate, category share, market opportunity, and market size, are based to some extent on information provided by third-party providers. This information involves a number of assumptions and limitations, and although we believe the information from such third-party sources is reliable, we have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the data contained in such third-party sources or the methodologies for collecting such data. If there are any limitations or errors with respect to such data or methodologies, or if investors do not perceive such data or methodologies to be accurate, or if we discover material inaccuracies with respect to such data or methodologies, we may lose the confidence of our investors and our reputation, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.",
                "Risks Related to our Intellectual Property": "Failure to adequately protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur business depends on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants who develop intellectual property on our behalf to enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements, and third parties we share information with to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information or technology, or infringement of our intellectual property. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may copy aspects of our platform or other software, technology, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary. In addition, unauthorized parties may also attempt, or successfully endeavor, to obtain our intellectual property, confidential information, and trade secrets through various methods, including through cybersecurity attacks, and legal or other methods of protecting this data may be inadequate.\n\nWe have registered, among other trademarks, the term “DoorDash” in the United States, Canada, and other jurisdictions, and \"Wolt\" throughout the EU and in other countries in which Wolt operates. Competitors have and may continue to adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other trademarks that are similar to our trademarks. Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or other governmental authorities and administrative bodies in the United States and abroad may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights and to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Further, we may not timely or successfully apply for a patent or register our trademarks or otherwise secure our intellectual property. Our efforts to protect, maintain, or enforce our proprietary rights may be ineffective and could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nIntellectual property infringement assertions by third parties could result in significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\n\nWe operate in an industry with frequent intellectual property litigation. Other parties have asserted, and in the future may assert, that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We could be required to pay substantial damages or cease using intellectual property or technology that is deemed infringing.\n\nFurther, we cannot predict whether other assertions of third-party intellectual property rights or claims arising from such assertions would substantially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The defense of these claims and any future infringement claims, whether they are with or without merit or are determined in our favor, may result in costly litigation and diversion of technical and management personnel. Further, an adverse outcome of a dispute may require us to pay damages, potentially including treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are found to have willfully infringed a party’s patent or copyright rights, cease making, licensing, or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others, expend additional development resources to redesign our offerings, and enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies. Royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us, or at all. In any event, we may need to license intellectual property which would require us to pay royalties or make one-time payments. Even if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, the time and resources necessary to resolve them could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nWe may be unable to continue to use the domain names that we use in our business or prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand, trademarks, or service marks.\n\nWe have registered domain names that we use in, or are related to, our business, most importantly www.doordash.com. If we lose the ability to use a domain name, whether due to trademark claims, failure to renew the applicable registration, or any other cause, we may be forced to market our offerings under a new domain name, which could cause us a substantial harm, or to incur significant expense in order to purchase rights to the domain name in question. We may not be able to obtain preferred domain names outside the United States due to a variety of reasons. In addition, our competitors and others could attempt to capitalize on our brand recognition by using domain names similar to ours. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names that infringe on, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of our brand or our trademarks or service marks. Protecting, maintaining, and enforcing our rights in our domain names may require litigation, which could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources, which could in turn adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\nOur platform contains third-party open source software components, and failure to comply with the terms of the underlying open source software licenses could restrict our ability to provide our platform.\n\nOur platform contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification, or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our platform.\n\nSome open source licenses contain requirements that may, depending on how the licensed software is used or modified, require that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the licensed open source software, authorize further modification and redistribution of that source code, make that source code available at little or no cost, or grant other licenses to our intellectual property. If we combine our proprietary software with open source software in a certain manner, we could be required under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software under the terms of an open source software license. This could enable our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages. To avoid the release of the affected portions of our source code, we could be required to purchase additional licenses, expend substantial time, and resources to re-engineer some or all of our software or cease use or distribution of some or all of our software until we can adequately address the concerns.\n\nAlthough we have certain policies and procedures in place to monitor our use of open source software that are designed to avoid subjecting our platform to conditions we do not intend, those policies and procedures may not be effective to detect or address all such conditions. In addition, the terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. or foreign courts, and there is a risk that these licenses could be construed in a way that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to provide or distribute our platform. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their offerings. As a result, we could be subject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. If we are held to have breached or failed to fully comply with all the terms and conditions of an open source software license, we could face infringement or other liability, or be required to seek costly licenses from third parties to continue providing our platform on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our platform, to discontinue or delay the provision of our platform if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.",
                "Risks Related to Our Indebtedness and Liquidity": "We may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\n\nHistorically, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances and cash generated from our operations. To support our growing business and to effectively compete, we must have sufficient capital to continue to make significant investments in our platform. We intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new platform features and services or enhance and expand our existing platform, improve our operating infrastructure, acquire complementary businesses and technologies, or respond to challenging macroeconomic conditions. We believe our working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond. From time to time, we may seek additional equity or debt financing to fund capital expenditures, strategic initiatives, or investments and our ongoing operations. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity, equity-linked securities, or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new securities we issue could have rights, preferences, and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing will depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, and operating performance and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be impaired, and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected.\n\nOur revolving credit facility contains financial covenants and other restrictions on our actions that may limit our operational flexibility or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nThe terms of our revolving credit facility include a number of covenants that limit our ability and our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, grant liens, merge or consolidate with other companies or sell substantially all of our assets, pay dividends, make redemptions and repurchases of stock, make investments, loans and acquisitions, or engage in transactions with affiliates. The terms of our revolving credit facility may restrict our current and future operations and could adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs. In addition, complying with these covenants may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy, including potential acquisitions, and compete against companies which are not subject to such restrictions.\n\nA failure by us to comply with the covenants or payment requirements specified in our credit agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement, which would give the lenders the right to terminate their commitments to provide additional loans under our revolving credit facility and to declare all borrowings outstanding, together with accrued and unpaid interest and fees, to be immediately due and payable. If the debt under our revolving credit facility were to be accelerated, we may not have sufficient cash or be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt or sell sufficient assets to repay the debt, which could immediately adversely affect our business, cash flows, results of operations, and financial condition. Even if we were able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. As of December 31, 2022, there were no revolving loans outstanding and $99 million in aggregate face amount of letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility.",
                "Risks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock": "The multi-class structure of our common stock and the Voting Agreement between our Co-Founders has the effect of concentrating voting power with Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, which will limit your ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\n\nOur Class A common stock has one vote per share, our Class B common stock has 20 votes per share, and our Class C common stock has no voting rights, except as otherwise required by law. Our Co-Founders together hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of our Class B common stock. As of December 31, 2022, Tony Xu, our co-founder, Chief Executive Officer, and Chair of our board of directors, Andy Fang, our co-founder, Head of Consumer Engineering, and a member of our board of directors, and Stanley Tang, our co-founder, Head of DoorDash Labs, and a member of our board of directors collectively held 61% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock in aggregate, which voting power may increase over time as our Co-Founders exercise or vest in outstanding equity awards (including those equity awards granted to our Co-Founders prior to our initial public offering (\"IPO\") and subject to equity exchange right agreements whereby each of our Co-Founders has a right (but not an obligation) to require us to exchange any shares of Class A common stock received upon the exercise of options to purchase shares of Class A common stock or the vesting and settlement of RSUs related to shares of Class A common stock for an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock). If all such equity awards held by our Co-Founders (including the CEO Performance Award) had been exercised or vested and exchanged for shares of Class B common stock as of December 31, 2022, our Co-Founders would collectively hold 73% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Our Co-Founders have also entered into the Voting Agreement, whereby Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. As a result, Mr. Xu will be able to determine or significantly influence any action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including the election of our board of directors, the adoption of amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and the approval of any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets, or other major corporate transaction. Mr. Xu may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in a way with which you disagree and which may be adverse to your interests. This concentrated control may have the effect of delaying, preventing, or deterring a change in control of our company, could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their capital stock as part of a sale of our company, and might ultimately affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Further, the separation between voting power and economic interests could cause conflicts of interest between our Co-Founders and our other stockholders, which may result in Mr. Xu undertaking, or causing us to undertake, actions that would be desirable for himself or our Co-Founders but would not be desirable for our other stockholders.\n\nFuture transfers by the holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares automatically converting into shares of Class A common stock, subject to limited exceptions, such as certain transfers effected for estate planning or other transfers among our Co-Founders and their family members. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will convert automatically into one share of Class A common stock upon (i) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the first date on which the number of shares of our capital stock, including Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock, and any shares of capital stock underlying equity securities or other convertible instruments, held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities and permitted transferees is less than 35% of the Class B common stock held by Mr. Xu and his permitted entities as of immediately following the completion of our IPO, which we sometimes refer to herein as the \"35% Ownership Threshold;\" (ii) 12 months after the death or permanent and total disability of Mr. Xu, during which 12-month period the shares of our Class B common stock shall be voted as directed by a person designated by Mr. Xu and approved by our board of directors (or if there is no such person, then our secretary then in office); (iii) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date on which Mr. Xu is terminated for cause (as defined in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation); or (iv) the date fixed by our board of directors that is no less than 61 days and no more than 180 days following the date upon which (A) Mr. Xu is no longer providing services to us as an officer, employee, or consultant and (B) Mr. Xu is no longer a member of our board of directors, either as a result of Mr. Xu’s voluntary resignation or as a result of a request or agreement by Mr. Xu at a meeting of our stockholders for Mr. Xu not to be renominated as a member of our board of directors. We refer to the date on which such final conversion of all outstanding shares of Class B common stock pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation occurs as the \"Final Conversion Date.\"\n\nWe have no current plans to issue shares of our Class C common stock, which entitle the holder to zero votes per share (except as otherwise required by law). These shares will be available to be used in the future to further strategic initiatives, such as financings or acquisitions, or issue future equity awards to our service providers. Over time the issuance of shares of Class A common stock will result in voting dilution to all of our stockholders and this dilution could eventually result in our Co-Founders, in particular Mr. Xu, holding less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power. Once our Co-Founders own less than a majority of our total outstanding voting power, Mr. Xu would no longer have the unilateral ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of any matter submitted for a vote of our stockholders. Because the shares of Class C common stock would have no voting rights (except as required by law), the issuance of such shares will not result in further voting dilution, which would prolong the voting control of Mr. Xu. Further, the issuance of such shares of Class C common stock to Mr. Xu would also delay the final conversion of all of our outstanding Class B common stock because shares of Class C common stock issued to Mr. Xu would be counted when determining whether the 35% Ownership Threshold has been met. As a result, the issuance of shares of Class C common stock could prolong the duration of Mr. Xu’s control of our voting power and his ability to elect all of our directors and to determine the outcome of most matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, we could issue shares of Class C common stock to our Co-Founders and, in that event, they would be able to sell such shares of Class C common stock and achieve liquidity in their holdings without diminishing Mr. Xu’s voting control. Any future issuances of shares of Class C common stock will not be subject to approval by our stockholders except as required by the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nAlthough we do not expect to rely on the “controlled company” exemption under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange, we expect to have the right to use such exemption and therefore we could in the future avail ourselves of certain reduced corporate governance requirements.\n\nAs a result of our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, our Co-Founders collectively hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2022, and Mr. Xu will have the authority (and irrevocable proxy) to direct the vote and vote the shares of Class B common stock held by Messrs. Fang and Tang, and their respective permitted entities and permitted transferees, at his discretion on all matters to be voted upon by stockholders. Therefore, we are considered a “controlled company” as that term is set forth in the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. Under these listing standards, a company in which over 50% of the voting power for the election of directors is held by an individual, a group, or another company is a “controlled company” and may elect not to comply with certain listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange regarding corporate governance, including:\n• the requirement that a majority of its board of directors consist of independent directors;\n\n• the requirement that its nominating or corporate governance committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities and an annual performance evaluation of the committee; and\n\n• the requirement that its compensation committee be composed entirely of independent directors with a written charter addressing the committee’s purpose and responsibilities, an annual performance evaluation of the committee, and the rights and responsibilities of the committee relate to any compensation consultant, independent legal advisors, or any other advisor retained by the committee.\n\nThese requirements would not apply to us if, in the future, we choose to avail ourselves of the “controlled company” exemption. Although we qualify as a “controlled company,” we do not currently expect to rely on these exemptions and intend to fully comply with all corporate governance requirements under the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange. However, if we were to utilize some or all of these exemptions, we would not comply with certain of the corporate governance standards of the New York Stock Exchange, which could adversely affect the protections for other stockholders.\n\nWe cannot predict the effect our multi-class structure may have on the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe cannot predict whether our multi-class structure will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock, in adverse publicity, or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multi-class share structures in certain of their indices. In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituencies of its indices to have greater than 5% of the company’s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer admit companies with multi-class share structures to certain of its indices. Affected indices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the S&P Composite 1500. Under such announced policies, the multi-class structure of our common stock makes us ineligible for inclusion in certain indices and, as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment vehicles that attempt to track those indices would not invest in our Class A common stock. These policies are relatively new and it is unclear what effect, if any, they will have on the long-term valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from such indices, but it is possible that they may depress valuations, as compared to similar companies that are included. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indices, exclusion from certain stock indices would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\n\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\n\n• price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\n• volatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\n\n• changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\n• sales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders, as well as the perception that such sales could occur;\n\n• failure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts who follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\n• the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet those projections;\n\n• announcements by us or our competitors of new services or platform features;\n\n• the public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC, or those of our competitors or others in our industry;\n\n• rumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\n\n• actual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\n• actual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape generally;\n\n• litigation involving us, our industry or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of our competitors;\n\n• actual or perceived privacy or security breaches or other incidents;\n\n• developments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\n\n• announced or completed acquisitions of businesses, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\n\n• new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\n• changes in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\n\n• any significant change in our management;\n\n• general economic conditions, including the effects of increased inflation and interest rates, and slow or negative growth of our markets; and\n\n• other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism, natural disasters, public health concerns or epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, natural disasters, or responses to these events.\n\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources.\n\nSale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock, or the perception that such sales could occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock in the market, and the perception that these sales could occur may also depress the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nCertain stockholders are entitled, under our investors’ rights agreement, to require us to register shares owned by them for public sale in the United States. In addition, we have previously registered shares for future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable exercise periods, the shares issued upon exercise of outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding RSU awards will be available for immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\n\nSales of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A common stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\n\nWe may not realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of our share repurchase programs, and any failure to repurchase our Class A common stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our stock price.\n\nWe have authorized share repurchase programs in the past and may authorize other share repurchase programs in the future. Under existing or any future share repurchase programs, we may make share repurchases through a variety of methods, including open share market purchases, block transactions, or privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable federal securities laws. Our share repurchase programs may have no time limit, may not obligate us to repurchase any specific number of shares, and may be suspended at any time at our discretion and without prior notice. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will be subject to liquidity, stock price, market and economic conditions, compliance with applicable legal requirements, such as Delaware surplus and solvency tests, management discretion, and other relevant factors. Any failure to repurchase stock after we have announced our intention to do so may negatively impact our reputation and investor confidence in us and may negatively impact our stock price.\n\nThe existence of these share repurchase programs could cause our stock price to be higher than it otherwise would be and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Although these programs are intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance they will do so because the market price of our Class A common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the effectiveness of our repurchase programs. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that our stock repurchases in the past or in the future will be able to successfully mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity awards we grant to our employees.\n\nRepurchasing our Class A common stock will reduce the amount of cash we have available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions or business opportunities, and other general corporate requirements, and we may fail to realize the anticipated long-term stockholder value of these share repurchase programs.\n\nDelaware law and provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the market price of our Class A common stock.\n\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult, including the following:\n• any amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation require the approval of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock;\n\n• our amended and restated bylaws provide that approval of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock voting as a single class is required for stockholders to amend or adopt any provision of our bylaws;\n\n• our multi-class common stock structure and the Voting Agreement, which provide Tony Xu with the ability to determine or significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A common stock, Class B common stock, and Class C common stock;\n\n• our board of directors is classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms and directors are only able to be removed from office for cause;\n\n• until the first date on which the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than a majority of the total combined voting power of our Class A common stock and our Class B common stock (the “Voting Threshold Date”), our stockholders will only be able to take action by written consent if such action is first recommended or approved by our board of directors;\n\n• after the Voting Threshold Date, our stockholders will only be able to take action at a meeting of stockholders and will not be able to take action by written consent for any matter;\n\n• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting;\n\n• vacancies on our board of directors will be able to be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n\n• a special meeting of our stockholders may only be called by the chairperson of our board of directors, our Chief Executive Officer, or a majority of our board of directors;\n\n• certain litigation against us can only be brought in Delaware;\n\n• our amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established and shares of which may be issued without further action by our stockholders; and\n\n• advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\n\nThese provisions, alone or together, could discourage, delay, or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and to cause us to take other corporate actions they desire, any of which, under certain circumstances, could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our Class A common stock, and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our Class A common stock.\n\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate a U.S. state or federal court located within the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\n\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws or (iv) any other action asserting a claim that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all cases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. Our amended and restated bylaws also provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"). Nothing in our amended and restated bylaws precludes stockholders that assert claims under the Exchange Act from bringing such claims in state or federal court, subject to applicable law.\n\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies’ charter documents has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. For example, in December 2018, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware determined that a provision stating that U.S. federal district courts are the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act is not enforceable. Although this decision was reversed by the Delaware Supreme Court in March 2020, courts in other states may still find these provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the exclusive forum provisions in our amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about us, our business, or our market, or if they change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, the market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\n\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and are often different from our estimates or expectations. If any of the analysts who cover us change their recommendation regarding our Class A common stock adversely, provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities would likely decline. If few securities analysts commence coverage of us, or if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets and demand for our securities could decrease, which could cause the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\n\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future.\n\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future earnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not anticipate declaring or paying any dividends to holders of our capital stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our revolving credit facility contains restrictions on our ability to pay dividends. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment."

For some matters for which a material loss is reasonably possible, an estimate of the amount of loss or range of losses is not possible nor are we able to estimate the loss or range of losses that could potentially result from the application of nonmonetary remedies. Until the final resolution of Legal Proceedings, there may be an exposure to a material loss in excess of the amount recorded.\n\nExcept as set forth below, we are not, and have not been within the past 12 months, party to any material administrative, legal, or arbitration proceeding that may have or have had a significant effect on the financial position or profitability of DoorDash, and we are not aware of any such proceedings being pending or threatened.",
              "subsections": {
                "Independent contractor classification matters": "We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be subject to claims, lawsuits, arbitration proceedings, administrative actions, government investigations, and other legal and regulatory proceedings at the federal, state, and municipal levels challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors, and claims that, by the alleged misclassification, we have violated various labor and other laws that would apply to delivery employees. Laws and regulations that govern the status and classification of independent contractors are subject to change and divergent interpretations by various authorities, which can create uncertainty and unpredictability for us.\n\nWe are currently involved in a number of putative class actions, representative actions, such as those brought under PAGA and individual claims both in court as well as arbitration and other matters challenging the classification of Dashers on our platform as independent contractors. In January 2022, the Superior Court of California, County of Los Angeles, granted final approval of a revised settlement agreement pursuant to which we agreed to pay $100 million to the representatives of Dashers that had filed certain actions in California and Massachusetts in settlement of claims under PAGA and class action claims alleging worker misclassification of Dashers (the \"Marko settlement\"). All legal matters under the Marko settlement have been resolved and all amounts related to the Marko settlement were paid by us during the second quarter of 2022. See the section titled “Legal Proceedings” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2022 for additional information regarding the proceedings related to the Marko settlement.\n\nVarious other Dashers have challenged or threatened to challenge, and may challenge in the future, their classification on our platform, as an independent contractor under U.S. federal and state and international law, seeking monetary, injunctive, or other relief. We are currently involved in a number of such actions filed by individual Dashers, with many additional claims threatened, including those brought in, or compelled pursuant to our independent contractor agreement to, individual arbitration. In addition, in June 2020, the San Francisco District Attorney filed an action in the Superior Court of California, County of San Francisco, alleging that we misclassified California Dashers as independent contractors as opposed to employees in violation of the California Labor Code and the California Unfair Competition Law, among other allegations. This action is seeking both restitutionary damages and a permanent injunction that would bar us from continuing to classify California Dashers as independent contractors. It is a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred; however, the possible range of losses is not estimable given the status of the case.\n\nWe believe that we have meritorious defenses and intend to dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Legal Proceedings related to these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, diversion of management resources, and other factors.\n\nWe have been proactively working with state and local governments and regulatory bodies to ensure that our platform can continue to operate in the United States and foreign jurisdictions. New laws and regulations and changes to existing laws and regulations continue to be adopted, implemented, and interpreted in response to our industry and related technologies. For example, the California Legislature passed AB 5, which was signed into law in September 2019 and became effective in January 2020. AB 5 codified the standard in Dynamex regarding contractor classification, expanded its application, and created numerous carve-outs. We, along with certain other companies, supported a campaign for Proposition 22 to address AB 5 and preserve flexibility for California Dashers, which was approved by voters in November 2020 and went into effect in December 2020. However, in February 2021, petitioners consisting of a number of individuals and labor groups filed a writ of mandate petitioning the Alameda County Superior Court to compel the State of California not to enforce any provisions of Proposition 22 as unconstitutional. In August 2021, after a merits hearing, the Alameda County Superior Court issued an order finding that the entirety of Proposition 22 is unenforceable. The California Attorney General, the Protect App-Based Drivers and Services coalition and individual sponsors of Proposition 22 filed appeals in the California Court of Appeal.\n\nIn addition, several other jurisdictions where we operate may be considering adopting legislation, or we may propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, which would pair worker flexibility and independence with new protections and benefits, and we are engaged in ongoing discussions with Dashers, policy makers, and other stakeholders regarding the future of the type of work that Dashers perform. To the extent other jurisdictions adopt such legislation, or we propose or support legislation, ballot initiatives, or other legislative processes, we would expect our costs related to Dashers in such jurisdictions to increase and we could experience lower order volumes in such jurisdictions if we charge higher fees and commissions as a result of such laws, which would adversely impact our results of operations. Even with the passage of Proposition 22 and similar legislation, such initiatives and legislation could still be challenged and subject to litigation. Additionally, some jurisdictions are considering implementing standards similar to AB 5 to determine worker classification.\n\nWith the breadth of our geographic scope, the classification of Dashers that utilize our platform as independent contractors may be subject to challenge in other jurisdictions. In particular, through Wolt, we are subject to local regulations and challenges in Europe and Asia to the classification of Wolt courier partners as independent contractors. Further, in certain jurisdictions where there are uncertainties associated with the interpretation of applicable law, we may decide to adopt employment-based models, as Wolt already does in Germany, which could result in certain operational challenges and increased costs and cause us to withdraw from certain countries or decide not to expand our business in or into a certain jurisdiction, which could limit our growth and expansion opportunities.",
                "Consumer protection and other actions": "We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in other Legal Proceedings in the ordinary course of business, including class action lawsuits and actions brought by government authorities, alleging violations of consumer protection laws, data protection laws, civil rights laws and other laws. In addition, we have been subject to Legal Proceedings related to representations regarding tips paid to Dashers and our former DoorDash Dasher pay model. We dispute any allegations of wrongdoing and intend to continue to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.",
                "Intellectual property matters": "We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings related to alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property and, in the ordinary course of business, we receive correspondence from other purported holders of patents and other intellectual property offering to license such property and/or asserting infringement of such property. We dispute any allegation of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.",
                "Regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries": "We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be the subject of regulatory and administrative investigations, audits, and inquiries conducted by federal, state, or local governmental agencies concerning our business practices, the classification and compensation of Dashers, DoorDash Dasher pay models, compliance with consumer protection laws, privacy, data security, tax issues, unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation insurance, and other matters. For example, we are currently under audit by the Employment Development Department of the State of California (the \"CA EDD\") for payroll tax liabilities. In January 2023, the CA EDD issued a negative assessment in connection with such audit. We believe that we have meritorious defenses to the CA EDD’s assessment, and intend to vigorously appeal this assessment. For more information on the CA EDD's assessment, see Note 10 – \"Commitments and Contingencies\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Results of investigations, audits, and inquiries and related governmental action are inherently unpredictable and, as such, there is always the risk of an investigation, audit, or inquiry having a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, particularly in the event that an investigation, audit, or inquiry results in a lawsuit or unfavorable regulatory enforcement or other action. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us in light of the costs associated with cooperating with, or defending against, such matters, and the diversion of management resources, and other factors.",
                "Personal injury matters": "We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be involved in Legal Proceedings where various parties may claim that we are liable for damages related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers who have been active on our platform. We are currently named as a defendant in a number of matters related to accidents or other incidents involving Dashers that utilize our platform. In many of these matters, we believe we have meritorious defenses, dispute the allegations of wrongdoing, and intend to defend ourselves vigorously. There is no pending or threatened legal proceeding that has arisen from these accidents or incidents that individually, in our opinion, is likely to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations; however, results of litigation and claims are inherently unpredictable and legal proceedings related to such accidents or incidents, in the aggregate, could have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Regardless of the outcome, these matters can have an adverse impact on us because of defense and settlement costs individually and in the aggregate, the diversion of management resources, and other factors."

                "Overview": "DoorDash, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware with headquarters in San Francisco, California. We provide a local commerce platform that enables local businesses to address consumers’ expectations of ease and immediacy and thrive in today’s convenience economy.\n\nWe operate a local commerce platform that connects merchants, consumers, and Dashers. Our primary offerings are the DoorDash Marketplace, which operates in four countries including the United States, and the Wolt Marketplace, which operates in 23 countries, most of which are in Europe. Both of our Marketplaces provide a suite of services that enable merchants to establish an online presence, generate demand, seamlessly transact with consumers, and fulfill orders primarily through Dashers. As part of our Marketplaces, we also offer Pickup, which allows consumers to place advance orders, skip lines, and pick up their orders conveniently with no consumer fees, as well as DoorDash for Work, which provides merchants on our platform with large group orders and catering orders for businesses and events. The DoorDash Marketplace also includes DashPass and the Wolt Marketplace includes Wolt+. DashPass and Wolt+ are our membership products, which provide members with unlimited access to eligible merchants with zero delivery fees and reduced service fees on eligible orders.\n\nIn addition to our Marketplaces, we offer Platform Services, which primarily includes DoorDash Drive and Wolt Drive, which are white-label delivery fulfillment services that enable merchants that have generated consumer demand through their own channels to fulfill this demand using our platform. Platform Services also includes Storefront, which enables merchants to create their own branded online ordering experience, providing them with a turnkey solution to offer consumers on-demand access to e-commerce without investing in in-house engineering or fulfillment capabilities, and Bbot, which offers merchants solutions for their in-store and online channels, including in-store digital ordering and payments.",

For more information regarding our use of these measures and reconciliations to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP, see the section titled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.\"\n\nTotal Orders. We define Total Orders as all orders completed through our Marketplaces and Platform Services businesses over the period of measurement.\n\nIn 2022, Total Orders increased to 1.7 billion, or 25% growth compared to 2021. The increase in Total Orders was driven primarily by growth in consumers and increased consumer engagement as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\n\nMarketplace GOV. We define Marketplace GOV as the total dollar value of orders completed on our Marketplaces, including taxes, tips(5), and any applicable consumer fees, including membership fees related to DashPass and Wolt+. Marketplace orders include orders completed through Pickup and DoorDash for Work. Marketplace GOV does not include the dollar value of orders, taxes and tips, or fees charged to merchants, for orders fulfilled through Drive and Storefront.\n\nIn 2022, Marketplace GOV increased to $53.4 billion, or 27% growth compared to 2021, driven primarily by organic growth in Total Orders as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\n\nContribution Profit (Loss). We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off related to restructuring. Gross profit (loss) is defined as revenue less (i) cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization and (ii) depreciation and amortization related to cost of revenue.\n\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders.\n\nIn 2022, Contribution Profit improved to $1.6 billion, compared to a Contribution Profit of $1.1 billion in 2021, driven primarily by growth in Marketplace GOV, an increase in Net Revenue Margin, defined as revenue expressed as a percentage of Marketplace GOV, and leverage on sales and marketing expenses, partially offset by an increase in cost of revenue.\n\nContribution Profit (Loss) is a non-GAAP financial measure with certain limitations regarding its usefulness. It does not reflect our financial results in accordance with GAAP as it does not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Accordingly, Contribution Profit (Loss) is not indicative of our overall results or an indicator of past or future financial performance. Further, it is not a financial measure of total company profitability and it is neither intended to be used as a proxy for total company profitability nor does it imply profitability for our business.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA. We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests, adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs), (iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory write-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest (income) and expense, (ix) other (income) expense, net, (x) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we use to assess our operating performance and the operating leverage in our business.\n\nIn 2022, Adjusted EBITDA increased to $361 million, compared to Adjusted EBITDA of $289 million in 2021, as growth in Contribution Profit was partially offset by organic increases in adjusted research and development expenses and adjusted general and administrative expenses, as well as our acquisition of Wolt.\n\nFree Cash Flow. We define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\n\nIn 2022, Free Cash Flow decreased to $21 million, compared to Free Cash Flow of $455 million in 2021, driven primarily by changes in operating assets and liabilities and increases in cash outflows from purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\n\n(5) Dashers receive 100% of tips.",
                "Components of Results of Operations": "Revenue\n\nWe generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. Commissions from partner merchants are based on an agreed-upon rate applied to the total dollar value of goods ordered in exchange for using our Marketplaces to sell the partner merchants’ products. Fees from consumers are for use of our Marketplaces to arrange for delivery services. We recognize revenue from Marketplace orders on a net basis as we are an agent for both partner merchants and consumers. Our revenue therefore reflects commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers less (i) Dasher payout and (ii) refunds, credits, and promotions, which includes certain discounts and incentives provided to consumers, including those for referring a new customer. Revenue from our Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\n\nWe also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass and Wolt+, which is recognized as part of our Marketplaces revenue. Revenue generated from our DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer.\n\nIn addition, we generate revenue from other sources, including from our Platform Services, which primarily consists of our Drive and Storefront offerings. We generate revenue from Drive by collecting per-order fees from merchants to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\n\nCost of Revenue, Exclusive of Depreciation and Amortization\n\nCost of revenue primarily consists of (i) order management costs, which include payment processing charges, net of rebates issued from payment processors, costs associated with cancelled orders, insurance expenses, costs related to placing orders with non-partner merchants, and costs related to first party product sales, for which we take control of inventory (ii) platform costs, which include costs for onboarding merchants and Dashers, costs for providing support for consumers, merchants, and Dashers, and technology platform infrastructure costs, and (iii) personnel costs, which include personnel-related compensation expenses related to our local operations, support, and other teams, and allocated overhead. Personnel-related compensation expenses primarily include salary, bonus, benefits, and stock-based compensation expense. Allocated overhead is determined based on an allocation of shared costs, such as facilities (including rent and utilities) and information technology costs, among all departments based on employee headcount.\n\nSales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of advertising and other ancillary expenses related to merchant, consumer, and Dasher acquisition, including certain consumer referral credits and Dasher referral fees paid to the referrers to the extent they represent fair value of acquiring a new consumer or a new Dasher, brand marketing expenses, personnel-related compensation expenses for sales and marketing employees, and commissions expense including amortization of deferred contract costs, as well as allocated overhead.\n\nResearch and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related compensation expenses related to data analytics and the design of, product development of, and improvements to our platform, as well as expenses associated with the licensing of third-party software and allocated overhead.\n\nGeneral and Administrative\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of legal, tax, and regulatory expenses, which include litigation settlement expenses and sales and indirect taxes, personnel-related compensation expenses related to administrative employees, which include finance and accounting, human resources and legal, chargebacks associated with fraudulent credit card transactions, professional services fees, transaction-related expenses, bad debt expense, and allocated overhead.\n\nDepreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation and amortization expenses associated with our property and equipment and intangible assets. Depreciation primarily includes expenses associated with equipment for merchants, computer equipment and software, office equipment, and leasehold improvements. Amortization includes expenses associated with our capitalized software and website development costs, as well as acquired intangible assets.\n\nRestructuring Charges\n\nRestructuring charges primarily consist of separation-related payments and other termination benefit costs associated with a reduction in workforce that is discussed in further detail in Note 17 – \"Restructuring\" included in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as costs associated with other restructuring activities in 2022.\n\nInterest Income\n\nInterest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\nInterest Expense\n\nInterest expense consists of interest costs primarily related to our revolving credit facility and payment-in-kind interest on our Convertible Notes issued in February 2020.\n\nOther Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including impairment, as well as gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency.\n\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\n\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes primarily results from losses generated outside the U.S. for which an income tax benefit was recognized, as well as the income tax expense associated with U.S. state and foreign operations.",

As a result of the valuation allowance, such income tax benefit is not expected to recur in the future.",
                "Non-GAAP Financial Measures": "We use adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with GAAP measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance, including the preparation of our annual operating budget and quarterly forecasts, to evaluate the effectiveness of our business strategies and to communicate with our board of directors concerning our business and financial performance. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors about our business and financial performance, enhance their overall understanding of our past performance and future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to metrics used by our management in their financial and operational decision making. We are presenting these non-GAAP financial measures to assist investors in seeing our business and financial performance through the eyes of management, and because we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide an additional tool for investors to use in comparing results of operations of our business over multiple periods with other companies in our industry.\n\nOur definitions may differ from the definitions used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. In addition, other companies may not publish these or similar metrics. Further, these metrics have certain limitations in that they do not include the impact of certain expenses that are reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. Thus, our adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow should be considered in addition to, not as substitutes for, or in isolation from, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.\n\nWe compensate for these limitations by providing a reconciliation of adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow to their respective related GAAP financial measures. We encourage investors and others to review our business, results of operations, and financial information in its entirety, not to rely on any single financial measure, and to view adjusted cost of revenue, adjusted sales and marketing expense, adjusted research and development expense, adjusted general and administrative expense, Contribution Profit (Loss), Contribution Margin, Adjusted Gross Profit (Loss), Adjusted Gross Margin, Adjusted EBITDA, and Free Cash Flow in conjunction with their respective related GAAP financial measures.\n\nAdjusted Cost of Revenue\n\nWe define adjusted cost of revenue as cost of revenue, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, excluding stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, allocated overhead, and inventory write-off related to restructuring.

These excluded costs and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii) reserves for the collection of sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) costs related to the settlement of an intellectual property matter, (iv) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification and price controls, and (v) donations as part of our relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of adjusted general and administrative expense because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\n\n(2) Consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs, primarily related to the Wolt acquisition for 2022.\n\n(3) Consists of impairment expense related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with our former headquarters.\n\nContribution Profit (Loss)\n\nWe use Contribution Profit (Loss) to evaluate our operating performance and trends. We believe that Contribution Profit (Loss) is a useful indicator of the economic impact of orders fulfilled through DoorDash as it takes into account the direct expenses associated with generating and fulfilling orders. We define Contribution Profit (Loss) as our gross profit (loss) less sales and marketing expense plus (i) depreciation and amortization expense related to cost of revenue, (ii) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, (iii) allocated overhead included in cost of revenue and sales and marketing expenses, and (iv) inventory write-off related to restructuring.

We define Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) including redeemable non-controlling interests, adjusted to exclude (i) certain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses, (ii) loss on disposal of property and equipment, (iii) transaction-related costs (primarily consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs), (iv) impairment expenses, (v) restructuring charges, (vi) inventory write-off related to restructuring, (vii) provision for (benefit from) income taxes, (viii) interest (income) expense, net, (ix) other (income) expense, net, (x) stock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense, and (xi) depreciation and amortization expense.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net loss including redeemable non-controlling interests to Adjusted EBITDA:\n(in millions)                                   Year Ended December 31,\n                                                  2020       2021         2022\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nNet loss including redeemable non-controlling interests $-461      $-468        $-1,368\nCertain legal, tax, and regulatory settlements, reserves, and expenses(1) 160 77 72\nTransaction-related costs(2)                      1          10           68\nImpairment expenses(3)                            11          1            2\nRestructuring charges                             —           —           92\nInventory write-off related to restructuring      —           —            2\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes         3           5          -31\nInterest (income) expense, net                    25         11          -30\nOther (income) expense, net(4)                    -3          —          305\nStock-based compensation expense and certain payroll tax expense(5) 333 497 880\nDepreciation and amortization expense             120        156          369\nAdjusted EBITDA                                   $189       $289         $361\n\n(1) We exclude certain costs and expenses from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because management believes that these costs and expenses are not indicative of our core operating performance, do not reflect the underlying economics of our business, and are not necessary to operate our business. These excluded costs and expenses consist of (i) certain legal costs primarily related to worker classification matters, (ii) reserves for the collection of sales and indirect taxes that we do not expect to incur on a recurring basis, (iii) costs related to the settlement of an intellectual property matter, (iv) expenses related to supporting various policy matters, including those related to worker classification and price controls, and (v) donations as part of our relief efforts in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. We believe it is appropriate to exclude the foregoing matters from our calculation of Adjusted EBITDA because (1) the timing and magnitude of such expenses are unpredictable and thus not part of management’s budgeting or forecasting process, and (2) with respect to worker classification matters, management currently expects such expenses will not be material to our results of operations over the long term as a result of increasing legislative and regulatory certainty in this area, including as a result of Proposition 22 in California and similar legislation.\n\n(2) Consists of acquisition, integration, and investment related costs, primarily related to the Wolt acquisition for 2022.\n\n(3) Consists of impairment expense related to an operating lease right-of-use asset associated with our former headquarters.\n\n(4) Consists primarily of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including impairment, for 2022.\n\n(5) Excludes stock-based compensation related to restructuring, which is included in restructuring charges in the table above.\n\nFree Cash Flow\n\nWe define Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment and capitalized software and website development costs.\n\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of net cash provided by operating activities to Free Cash Flow:\n(in millions)                                   Year Ended December 31,\n                                                  2020       2021       2022\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nNet cash provided by operating activities         $252       $692       $367\nPurchases of property and equipment               -106       -129       -176\nCapitalized software and website development costs -53 -108 -170\nFree Cash Flow                                    $93        $455       $21",
                "Credit Facilities": "On November 19, 2019, we entered into a revolving credit and guaranty agreement with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., an affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs Lending Partners LLC, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, which, as amended and restated on August 7, 2020, and further amended on October 31, 2022, provides for a $300 million unsecured revolving credit facility maturing on August 7, 2025, which increased to $400 million in aggregate revolving commitments upon the consummation of our IPO, with a sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate face amount of up to $200 million. Loans under the credit facility bear interest, at our option, at (i) a base rate equal to the highest of (A) the prime rate, (B) the higher of the federal funds rate or a composite overnight bank borrowing rate plus 0.50%, or (C) an adjusted SOFR rate for a one-month interest period plus 1.00%, or (ii) an adjusted SOFR rate (based on an interest period of one, three, or six months) plus a margin equal to 1.00%. We are also obligated to pay other customary fees for a credit facility of this size and type, including letter of credit fees, an upfront fee, and an unused commitment fee. As of December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, no revolving loans were outstanding under the credit facility.\n\nWe maintain letters of credit established primarily for real estate leases and insurance policies. As of December 31, 2021 and 2022, we had $60 million and $132 million of issued letters of credit outstanding, respectively, of which $39 million and $99 million were issued under the revolving credit and guaranty agreement.",
                "Convertible Notes": "On February 19, 2020, we issued $340 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes pursuant to the Convertible Note Purchase Agreement, dated February 19, 2020, among us, Caviar, and the investors party thereto. We received net proceeds of $333 million, net of $2 million in debt issuance costs and an original issue discount of $5 million. The interest rate under the Convertible Notes was 10.00% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears. In February 2021, we repaid the outstanding principal and accrued interest of the Convertible Notes in full for $375 million.",
                "Liquidity and Capital Resources": "In December 2020, we completed our IPO in which we received net proceeds of $3.3 billion from sales of shares of our Class A common stock in the IPO, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities of $3.9 billion, which consisted of cash and cash equivalents of $2.0 billion, and short-term marketable securities of $1.5 billion and long-term marketable securities of $397 million. Additionally, funds held at payment processors of $441 million represent cash due from our payment processors for cleared transactions with merchants and consumers, as well as funds remitted to payment processors for Dasher payout. Cash and cash equivalents consisted of cash on deposit with banks as well as institutional money market funds and commercial paper. Marketable securities consisted of commercial paper, corporate bonds, U.S. government agency securities, and U.S. Treasury securities.\n\nWe have generated significant operating losses from our operations as reflected in our accumulated deficit of $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. To execute on our strategic initiatives to continue to grow our business, we may incur operating losses and generate negative cash flows from operations in the future, and as a result, we may require additional capital resources. We believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, along with the $400 million in available borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditures needs for at least the next 12 months and beyond. We have an obligation to our insurance provider which requires us to set aside collateral of up to $265 million in an escrow account. As of December 31, 2022, we had established and deposited into an escrow account an amount of $199 million, which is restricted from general use. We deposited the remaining collateral amount of $66 million on February 1, 2023.\n\nIn February 2023, we announced the authorization of a share repurchase program for the repurchase of shares of our Class A common stock, in an aggregate amount up to $750 million. This program is in addition to the prior repurchase program for the repurchase of $400 million shares of our Class A common stock, which was completed in the third quarter of 2022. Repurchases may be made from time to time through open market purchases or through privately negotiated transactions subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, and other relevant factors. Open market repurchases may be structured to occur in accordance with the requirements of Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. We may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of our Class A common stock under this authorization. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities.\n\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to our growth, our ability to attract and retain merchants, consumers, and Dashers that utilize our platform, the continuing market acceptance of our offerings, the timing and extent of spending to support our efforts to develop our platform, and the expansion of sales and marketing activities, the timing and extent of spending for policy and worker classification initiatives. Further, we may in the future enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in businesses, a products, services, and technologies. We may be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\nThe following table summarizes our cash flows for the periods indicated:\n(In millions)                                 Year Ended December 31,\n                                              2020         2021       2022\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nNet cash provided by operating activities     $252         $692       $367\nNet cash used in investing activities         -192         -2,047     -300\nNet cash provided by (used in) financing activities 3,996  -483       -375\nForeign currency effect on cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash 2 -1 -10\nNet increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $4,058 $-1,839 $-318\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, beginning of period 287 4,345 2,506\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash, end of period $4,345 $2,506 $2,188\nReconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash to the consolidated balance sheets\nCash and cash equivalents                     $4,345       $2,504     $1,977\nRestricted cash                               —            2          211\nTotal cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash $4,345 $2,506 $2,188\nSupplemental disclosure of cash flow information\nCash paid for interest                        $—          $42        $—\nNon-cash investing and financing activities\nConversion of redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock upon initial public offering $2,646 $— $—\nPurchases of property and equipment not yet settled $17 $23 $34\nUnrealized loss on marketable securities      $—          $-4        $-20\nStock-based compensation included in capitalized software and website development costs $8 $93 $132\nHoldback consideration for acquisitions       $3           $—         $8\n\nOperating Activities\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $367 million for 2022. This primarily consisted of a net loss of $1.4 billion, adjusted for certain non-cash items, which primarily includes $889 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, $369 million of depreciation and amortization expense and non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets, $303 million of adjustments to non-marketable equity securities, including impairment, net, and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $81 million, as well as $73 million net inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities for 2022 compared to 2021 was mainly due to the increase in net loss for 2022.\n\nCash provided by operating activities was $692 million for 2021. This consisted of a net loss of $468 million, offset by non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $486 million, non-cash depreciation and amortization expense of $156 million, non-cash reduction of operating lease right-of-use assets and accretion of operating lease liabilities of $52 million, and non-cash bad debt expense of $36 million, as well as $391 million net inflows from changes in operating assets and liabilities primarily driven by an increase in our accrued expenses.\n\nInvesting Activities\n\nCash used in investing activities was $300 million for 2022, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $1.9 billion, purchases of property and equipment of $176 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $170 million, and purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $15 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $1.9 billion and net cash acquired in acquisitions of $71 million.\n\nCash used in investing activities was $2.0 billion for 2021, which primarily consisted of purchases of marketable securities of $2.3 billion, purchases of non-marketable equity securities of $409 million, purchases of property and equipment of $129 million, cash outflows for capitalized software and website development costs of $108 million, offset by proceeds from the sales and maturities of marketable securities of $944 million.\n\nFinancing Activities\n\nCash used by financing activities was $375 million for 2022, which consisted repurchases of our Class A common stock of $400 million, partially offset by cash received from other financing activities of $14 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $11 million.\n\nCash used by financing activities was $483 million for 2021, which consisted of $333 million of repayment of the convertible promissory notes, $172 million of cash outflows for taxes paid related to net share settlement of equity awards, and $10 million of payment of deferred offering costs, partially offset by $32 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options.",
                "Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates": "Our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires us to make certain estimates, judgments, and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the related disclosures at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ significantly from our estimates. To the extent that there are differences between our estimates and actual results, our future financial statement presentation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be affected.\n\nWe believe that the accounting policies described below involve a significant degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, we believe these are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our consolidated financial condition and results of operations. For further information, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" included Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nRevenue Recognition\n\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with ASC 606. We generate a substantial majority of our revenue from orders completed through our Marketplaces and the related commissions charged to partner merchants and fees charged to consumers. A partner merchant represents a merchant that has entered into a contractual agreement with DoorDash. Revenue from our Marketplaces is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products. We also generate revenue from membership fees paid by consumers for DashPass, which is recognized as part of our Marketplaces. Revenue generated from DashPass and Wolt+ memberships is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period, which is generally one month to one year depending on the type of membership purchased by the consumer. In addition, we also generate revenue from our Drive offering by collecting per-order fees from merchants that use our local commerce platform to arrange for delivery services that fulfill demand generated through their own channels. Revenue from Drive is recognized at the point in time when the consumer obtains control of the merchant’s products.\n\nOur local commerce platform facilitates orders between consumers and partner merchants. Separately, the platform arranges for consumers to obtain delivery service from Dashers. We determined that the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are distinct performance obligations and therefore considered whether it is a principal or agent separately for each of these items. The order facilitation service and the delivery facilitation service are distinct given that the consumer can benefit from each item separately. Further, the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service are separately identifiable as the nature of the promises are to transfer the order facilitation service and delivery facilitation service individually, rather than as a combined item.\n\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\n\nJudgment is required in determining whether we are the principal or the agent in transactions with partner merchants, consumers, and Dashers. As it relates to the accounting for order facilitation services and delivery facilitation services, we evaluated whether to present revenue on a gross versus net basis based on whether we control each specified good or service before it is provided to the consumer in Marketplace transactions.\n\nWith respect to order facilitation services, we have determined that we are an agent for partner merchants in facilitating the sale of products to the consumer through our Marketplaces. The consumer accesses our local commerce platform to identify merchants and places an order for merchants’ products. These orders are picked up from partner merchants and delivered to consumers by Dashers. We do not control the products prior to them being transferred to the consumer as it neither has the ability to redirect the products to another consumer nor does it obtain any economic benefit from the products.\n\nWith respect to the vast majority of our delivery facilitation services, we have determined that we are acting as an agent for the consumer in facilitating the delivery of products by connecting consumers with Dashers. As our role with the delivery facilitation service is only to arrange for a delivery opportunity to be offered to prospective Dashers, we do not control how the delivery service is ultimately provided to the consumer.\n\nIn the vast majority of our transactions with end-users, we are an agent in facilitating the sale of products and delivery services, thus we report revenue on a net basis, reflecting amounts collected from consumers, less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers.\n\nWe recognize revenue from both partner merchants and consumers for each successfully completed transaction. We satisfy our performance obligations to a partner merchant when there is a successful sale of the merchant’s products and we meet our performance obligation to a consumer once the Dasher has picked up the products from the merchant for delivery to the consumer.\n\nGift Cards\n\nWe sell gift cards to consumers that can be redeemed through our Marketplaces. Those gift cards have no expiration date and administrative fees are not charged on unused gift cards. In prior periods, with limited history as to consumers' redemption patterns, proceeds from the sale of gift cards were fully deferred and recorded as contract liabilities until consumers use the card to place orders on its platform. When gift cards are redeemed, revenue is recognized on a net basis as the difference between the amounts collected from consumers less amounts remitted to merchants and Dashers. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we concluded that we had developed sufficient historical evidence regarding the pattern of consumer redemptions of gift cards to have the ability to estimate the portion of outstanding gift cards that will never be redeemed (“breakage”) and for which there is no legal obligation to remit the value of the unredeemed gift cards to the relevant jurisdiction as unclaimed or abandoned property. We recognize the breakage amounts as revenue, proportionate to the pattern of revenue recognition for the gift card redemptions. We recorded $48 million and $47 million of gift card breakage revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Estimating future breakage rates requires judgment based on current and historical patterns of redemption, and the actual breakage rates may vary from the estimate.\n\nDasher Incentives and Referrals\nWe offer various incentives to Dashers, which are primarily recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue. These are offered in various forms and include:\n\nPeak pay : We make additional payments to Dashers to incentivize them to accept delivery opportunities during peak demand time.\n\nDasher referrals : We offer referral bonuses to referring Dashers, as well as to referred Dashers, once the new Dasher has met certain qualifying conditions. We expense the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers as incurred in sales and marketing expenses in our consolidated statements of operations, since the marketing of our platform to acquire new Dashers represents a distinct benefit to us. The portion of these referral bonuses in excess of the fair value of payments made to the referring Dashers is accounted for as a reduction of revenue. Payments made to the referred Dashers are recorded within Dasher payout and reduce revenue at the time the corresponding revenue transaction is recorded.\n\nBusiness Combinations\n\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and as a result, actual results may differ from estimates. Acquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\n\nInsurance Reserves\n\nWe utilize third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The recorded insurance reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of our ultimate deductible obligation utilizes actuarial techniques applied to historical claim and loss experience. Given our limited operational history, we use assumptions based on actuarial judgments with consideration toward relevant industry claim and loss development factors, which includes the development time frame and settlement patterns, and expected loss rates. Reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary as experience develops or new information becomes known. However, ultimate results may differ from our estimates, which could result in losses over our reserved amounts.\n\nLoss Contingencies\n\nWe are involved in various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of business. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages. We record a liability when we believe that it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range can be reasonably estimated. We disclose material contingencies when we believe that a loss is not probable but reasonably possible.\n\nSignificant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. We review these provisions on a quarterly basis and adjust these provisions accordingly to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information.\n\nThe outcome of legal matters and litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management’s expectations, our results of operations, and financial condition, including in a particular reporting period, could be materially adversely affected.\n\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\n\nFor information on recently issued accounting pronouncements, see Note 2 – \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" included Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K."

              "content": "We are exposed to market risks in connection with our business, which primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange risks.",
              "subsections": {
                "Interest Rate Fluctuation Risk": "Our investment portfolio consists of short-term fixed income securities, including government and investment-grade debt securities and money market funds. These securities are classified as available-for-sale and, consequently, are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses, net of tax reported as a separate component of stockholders’ deficit within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Our investment policy and strategy are focused on the preservation of capital and supporting our liquidity requirements. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes.\n\nBased on our investment portfolio balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates would not have materially affected our consolidated financial statements. We currently do not hedge these interest rate exposures.",
                "Equity Price Risk": "Our non-marketable equity investments consist of investments in privately-held companies that we hold for purposes other than trading. These investments are inherently risky because there is no established market for these securities and the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. As such, we could lose our entire investment in these companies. However, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable.\n\nThe aggregate carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $409 million and $124 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Adjustments or impairments are recorded in other income (expense), net on the consolidated statements of operations and establish a new carrying value for the investment.",
                "Foreign Currency Exchange Risk": "Transaction Exposure\n\nWe transact business globally and have international revenue, as well as costs, denominated in multiple currencies, primarily the Euro, Canadian dollars, Israeli shekel and Australian dollars. This exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates are reflected in reported income (loss) from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations. A continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar would therefore reduce reported revenue and expenses from our international businesses included in our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWe have experienced and will continue to experience fluctuations in our net income (loss) as a result of transaction gains or losses related to revaluing and ultimately settling certain asset and liability balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the entities in which they are recorded. Foreign currency gains and losses were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2021, and 2022. Based on our foreign currency exposures from monetary assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022, we estimated that a 10% change in exchange rates against the U.S. dollar would not have resulted in a material gain or loss.\n\nTranslation Exposure\n\nWe are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars in consolidation.

                "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm": "To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors\n\nDoorDash, Inc.:\nOpinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of DoorDash, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive loss, redeemable non-controlling interests, redeemable convertible preferred stock and stockholders’ equity (deficit), and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\n\nThe Company acquired Bbot, LLC (“Bbot”) and Wolt Enterprises Oy (“Wolt”) during 2022, and management excluded from its assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, Bbot’s and Wolt’s internal control over financial reporting associated with total assets (excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets) of 5% and total revenues of 4% included in the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Bbot and Wolt.\n\nBasis for Opinions\n\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\n\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\n\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\nCritical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nAcquisition-date fair value of acquired intangible assets\n\nAs discussed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, on May 31, 2022, the Company acquired Wolt Enterprises Oy (Wolt) in a business combination for $2,838 million, which was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting that requires allocation of the fair value of the purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The Company recognized an acquired merchant relationships intangible asset associated with the generation of future income from Wolt’s existing merchants using a replacement cost method. Additionally, the Company recognized a trademark intangible asset associated with the value of Wolt’s brand name and an existing technology intangible asset associated with Wolt’s existing online and mobile platform for restaurant and grocery delivery and pickup orders using a relief-from-royalty method. The acquisition-date fair values of the merchant relationships, trademark, and existing technology intangible assets were $236 million, $268 million and $150 million, respectively.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the acquisition-date fair value measurements of the aforementioned intangible assets as a critical audit matter. Due to limited observable market information, a high degree of subjective auditor judgment was required to evaluate certain assumptions used to estimate the fair values, including the discount rate used in the valuation of each of the aforementioned intangible assets, and the revenue growth rates used in the valuation of the trademark and existing technology intangible assets. The estimated acquisition-date fair values of the aforementioned intangible assets were sensitive to changes to these assumptions.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the Company’s acquisition-date valuation process, including controls related to the development of the estimated revenue growth rates and discount rate. We evaluated the Company’s forecasted revenue growth rates by comparing them to those of Wolt’s comparable peers and industry reports. We compared the Company’s estimate of forecasted revenue growth in the first year to Wolt’s actual results to assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in:\n\n• evaluating the appropriateness of the comparable companies selected by the Company’s third-party valuation advisor used to determine the revenue growth rates by assessing the business description of the comparable companies and the industries in which they operate; and\n\n• evaluating the discount rate used in the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets by (1) assessing the reasonableness of the estimated market participant weighted average cost of capital (WACC) through a comparison of inputs to available market data, and (2) evaluating the reasonableness of the discount from the WACC to the discount rate used in the valuation of the aforementioned intangible assets by assessing the risk of the individual assets relative to the overall acquired business through a weighted average return on assets analysis.\n\nEvaluation of Insurance Reserves\n\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company utilizes third-party insurance which include retained insurance deductibles to insure costs including auto liability related to both bodily injury and physical damage, and uninsured and underinsured motorists up to a certain dollar retention limit. The retained insurance deductibles reserves reflect the estimated cost for claims incurred but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The estimate of the Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves as of December 31, 2022 was $418 million.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the Company's retained insurance deductibles reserves as a critical audit matter. The evaluation of the key assumptions used to estimate the liability, specifically the loss development factors and expected loss rates involved significant measurement uncertainty requiring complex auditor judgment. Specialized skill and knowledge were necessary to evaluate the methods and key assumptions used to determine the liability.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s retained insurance deductibles reserves process. This included controls over the development of the key assumptions related to loss development factors and expected loss rates. We involved actuarial professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in developing an independent range of the retained insurance deductibles reserves by selecting loss development factors and expected loss rates, and comparing it to the amount recorded by the Company.\n\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\nSan Francisco, California\nFebruary 24, 2023",

            "Item 9A. Controls and Procedures": {
              "content": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer (“certifying officers”), has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such evaluation, our certifying officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level as of December 31, 2022.\n\nManagement's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act). Our management, under the oversight of our Board of Directors, evaluated the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022.\n\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the SEC, companies are permitted to exclude acquisitions from their final assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurred. Our management's evaluation of internal control over financial reporting excluded Bbot, LLC (\"Bbot\") and Wolt, which we acquired on March 1, 2022 and June 1, 2022, respectively. Total assets (excluding acquired goodwill and intangible assets) and total revenues related to Bbot and Wolt collectively represented approximately 5% and 4% of our consolidated total assets and total revenues as of and for the year ended December 31, 2022, respectively.\n\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, KPMG LLP, who audited the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, issued an audit report on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. That Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm is included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in management's evaluation pursuant to Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Internal Controls\n\nOur management, including our certifying officers, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud due to the inherent limitations of internal controls. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\n\nA control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected."
