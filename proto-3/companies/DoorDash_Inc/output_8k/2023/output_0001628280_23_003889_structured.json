This program is in addition to the prior repurchase program for the repurchase of $400 million shares of Class A common stock, which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. The goal of the program is to offset a portion of the dilution associated with restricted stock units issued to employees as part of the Company’s overall compensation program. The Company’s board of directors expects to assess any future repurchase programs based on its balance sheet, expected free cash flow, and alternative investment opportunities at the time. Any future authorization will be approved and executed consistent with the the Company’s capital allocation strategy.",

DoorDash may also, from time to time, enter into Rule 10b5-1 plans to facilitate repurchases of its shares under this authorization. The repurchase program does not obligate the Company to acquire any particular amount of its Class A common stock, and it may be suspended at any time at the Company’s discretion. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased may depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternative investment opportunities."
