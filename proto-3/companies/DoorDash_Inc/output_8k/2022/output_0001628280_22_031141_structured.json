                "Plan Details and Estimated Costs": "The Plan includes the elimination of approximately 1,250 positions across the Company, or approximately 7% of the Company’s current employee workforce. The Company estimates that it will incur approximately $85 million in restructuring charges in connection with the Plan, consisting of approximately $68 million in cash expenditures for separation-related payments, benefits, and related taxes, and approximately $17 million in stock-based compensation related to equity compensation for employees who were terminated. The Company expects that most cash payments and expenses related to reductions in personnel will be incurred by the end of the first quarter of 2023, and that the implementation of the Plan will be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter of 2023.",
                "Potential Additional Charges and Non-GAAP Treatment": "The Company may incur other charges or cash expenditures not currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur as a result of or in connection with the implementation of the Plan. The Company intends to exclude the charges associated with the Plan from its non-GAAP financial measures, including non-GAAP operating expenses, contribution profit, adjusted gross profit, and adjusted EBITDA.",
                "Forward-Looking Statements": "This Current Report on Form 8-K (“Current Report”) contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), which statements involve substantial risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements generally relate to future events or our future financial or operating performance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as “may,” “will,” “should,” “expect,” “plan,” “anticipate,” “could,” “would,” “intend,” “target,” “project,” “contemplate,” “believe,” “estimate,” \"aim\", \"try\", “predict,” “potential” or “continue” or the negative of these words or other similar terms or expressions that concern our expectations, strategy, plans, or intentions. Forward-looking statements in this Current Report include, but are not limited to, statements regarding expectations related to the costs, timing, and financial impacts of the Plan. The Company’s expectations and beliefs regarding these matters may not materialize, and actual results in future periods are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. These risks and uncertainties include the possibility that: there are impediments to our ability to execute the Plan or related initiatives as currently contemplated; the actual charges in implementing the Plan or related initiatives are higher than anticipated; there are changes to the assumptions on which the estimated charges associated with the Plan or related initiatives are based; we are unable to achieve projected cost savings in connection with the Plan or related initiatives; there are unintended consequences from the Plan or related initiatives that impact our business; there are changes in the macroeconomic environment that impact our business; or we are unable to make accurate predictions about our future performance due to our limited operating history. The forward-looking statements contained in this Current Report are also subject to other risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted, including those more fully described in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. All forward-looking statements in this Current Report are based on information available to DoorDash and assumptions and beliefs as of the date hereof, and DoorDash disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, except as required by law."
