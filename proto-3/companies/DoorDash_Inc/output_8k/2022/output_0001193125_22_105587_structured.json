The purposes of the amendment include: (i) revising the consideration allocation mechanics to accommodate liquidation preference provisions of Wolt’s stockholders’ agreements and articles of association, and (ii) revising the treatment of Vested Wolt Options to provide that upon Closing, each Vested Wolt Option will be cancelled and the holder will receive either a substitute vested option to purchase DoorDash Class A common stock (for continuing Wolt employees) or shares of DoorDash Class A common stock (for non-continuing Wolt employees). The parties also agreed to updated forms of the lockup agreement and joinder agreement.
