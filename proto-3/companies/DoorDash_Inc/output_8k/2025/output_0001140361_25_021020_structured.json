              "content": "On May 30, 2025, DoorDash, Inc. (the “Company”) issued $2,750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 0% convertible senior notes due 2030 (the “Notes”). The Notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of May 30, 2025, between the Company and U.S. Bank Trust Company, National Association, as trustee. On May 27, 2025, in connection with the pricing of the Notes, the Company entered into privately negotiated convertible note hedge transactions and warrant transactions with certain financial institutions (the “Option Counterparties”).",

                "Indenture and Notes": "The Company issued $2,750,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 0% convertible senior notes due 2030. This amount includes the full exercise of the initial purchasers' option to purchase an additional $250,000,000 of Notes. The Company used approximately $338.5 million of the net proceeds to fund convertible note hedge transactions and intends to use the remainder for general corporate purposes, including potential acquisitions and share repurchases. The Notes are senior, unsecured obligations, will not bear regular cash interest, and will mature on May 15, 2030, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. Special interest may accrue under certain conditions. The initial conversion rate is 3.4250 shares of Class A common stock per $1,000 principal amount, representing an initial conversion price of approximately $291.97 per share. Before November 15, 2029, conversion is limited to certain events; thereafter, noteholders may convert at any time. The Company may redeem the Notes on or after May 20, 2028, if the last reported sale price of its Class A common stock exceeds 130% of the conversion price for a specified period. Upon a 'Fundamental Change,' noteholders may require the Company to repurchase their Notes. The Indenture includes customary 'Events of Default,' which, if they occur, could lead to the acceleration of the Notes' principal and interest.",
                "Convertible Note Hedge and Warrant Transactions": "On May 27, 2025, and May 28, 2025, the Company entered into convertible note hedge and warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties. The convertible note hedge transactions cover the number of shares of Class A common stock that initially underlie the Notes and are expected to reduce potential dilution upon conversion. The warrant transactions could have a dilutive effect if the market price per share of the Company's Class A common stock exceeds the strike price of the warrants, unless settled in cash."

Any shares of the Company’s Class A common stock issued upon conversion of the Notes will be issued in reliance upon Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act. Initially, a maximum of 13,421,650 shares of Class A common stock may be issued upon conversion. The warrants were sold to the Option Counterparties in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
