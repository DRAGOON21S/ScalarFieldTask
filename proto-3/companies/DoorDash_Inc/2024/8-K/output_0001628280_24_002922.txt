On January 31, 2024, the Board of Directors of DoorDash, Inc. ("DoorDash") approved revised severance benefits in
DoorDash’s Executive Change in Control and Severance Plan (the “Severance Plan”) for current and future
participants acting as DoorDash’s Chief Executive Officer and members of senior management directly reporting to
the Chief Executive Officer. Pursuant to these revisions, participants are eligible for 12 months of accelerated
vesting of equity awards that are subject to time-based vesting alone in the event that the applicable
participant’s employment is terminated by DoorDash other than for Cause or the participant’s death or Disability,
and other than in connection with a Change in Control (as the foregoing capitalized terms are defined in the
Severance Plan), subject to the participants entering into new participation agreements in the form attached to the
Severance Plan, and such benefits are in addition to the benefits provided under any prior participation agreements
entered into. DoorDash will enter into new participation agreements with the participants eligible for the benefits
set forth therein.
