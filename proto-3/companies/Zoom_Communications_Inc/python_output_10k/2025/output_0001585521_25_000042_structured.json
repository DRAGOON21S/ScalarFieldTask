Our culture of delivering happiness\ndrives our mission and values and is fundamental to everything we do at Zoom.\nZoom Workplace with AI Companion is an open, AI-first work platform for human connection. Zoom Workplace makes\nconnecting easier, more immersive, and more dynamic for businesses and individuals. We’re committed to evolving our\nplatform in ways that empower limitless human connection and solve real business problems. All of our product\ninnovation has a unified goal: to help streamline the workday through effective communication and collaboration\ntools. Together with Zoom Workplace, Zoom’s Business Services for sales, marketing, and customer experience teams,\nincluding Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Revenue Accelerator and Zoom Events strengthen customer relationships\nthroughout the customer lifecycle. The Zoom platform makes teamwork more meaningful, drives impact with\nintelligence, strengthens customer relationships, and enables seamless workflows. Trust is a cornerstone of the\nZoom platform. We equip users with a comprehensive set of tools to make their interactions safe, secure, and\nprivate. We believe that strong security should never compromise a great user experience.\nBusinesses of all sizes and individuals alike choose Zoom over other industry players for several reasons:\nWe care for customers at Zoom speed: Zoom puts customers first and is committed to providing a platform and\nproducts that people love. Zoom listens to its customers and puts innovation in customers' hands quickly to serve\ntheir needs.\nAI-first: Zoom’s mission is to deliver an AI-first work platform for human connection. This AI-first approach to\nZoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services is designed to allow individuals and teams to free up time and focus on\nwhat matters most: engaging, connecting, and delivering creative and insightful work, all within one unified\nplatform\nEnterprise readiness: Zoom is built to meet the needs of enterprises, with robust reliability, security,\ncompliance, and privacy capabilities and policies.\nDesigned for flexible work: Zoom is a platform designed for flexible communication and today’s flexible work\nneeds.\nZoom just works: Ease of use is a core design principle, along with quality and reliability.\nCost-effective and value-focused: The total cost of ownership of the Zoom platform, across the employee\nexperience and customer experience, is less than that of our competitors.\nOpen platform that enables customer choice: The Zoom developer ecosystem enables customers to choose the apps and\nintegrations they prefer. Zoom offers more than 2,900 apps on the Zoom App Marketplace and integrations with key\nsoftware vendors, such as Microsoft and Google.\nWe’re on a mission to reimagine the way the world communicates and collaborates. Zoom brings employee and customer\nexperience together into a single, AI-first, open platform that people love to use. Flagship products like Zoom\nMeetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Team Chat, and Zoom Docs are among the core products on the platform that are critical\nto business communication and collaboration needs. We strive to continue building a platform that helps people work\nsmarter, be more engaged with work, and better connect with each other. AI has been core to Zoom’s product DNA over\nmany years, grounded in our conviction that AI can make work more human by strengthening collaboration,\nproductivity, and inclusivity.\nIn fiscal year 2025, Zoom continued to invest in AI and focused on three key areas regarding AI: supporting\nindividual productivity, powering better collaboration, and helping customer-facing teams deliver meaningful\nbusiness value to delight their customers. In September 2023, we launched Zoom AI Companion, our smart assistant\nthat is designed to empower workers to increase productivity, improve team effectiveness, and enhance skills.\nAdditionally, we introduced our federated approach to AI, which enables the use of multiple large language models\n(“LLMs”), including Zoom’s own, to complete each task for users. Zoom’s federated approach allows its tech stack to\ndynamically select from multiple AI models, including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, making AI accessible\nand affordable so that more people can incorporate them in their day-to-day workflows. With these advancements in\nAI Companion and our broader AI strategy, we believe we’re well-positioned as AI technology continues to evolve. We\nare evolving agentic AI capabilities within AI Companion that will continue to deliver practical value to customers\nwhile building on our ambitious vision of AI that truly amplifies human potential for our customers. In line with\nour commitment to responsible AI, Zoom does not use customer audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments, or\nother communications (such as poll results, whiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom’s or third-party AI models.\n6\nTable of Contents\nZoom continues to be at the center of flexible work. Our continued product innovation is laser-focused on\nsupporting a flexible work environment, with new innovations in areas such as document collaboration, hybrid\nworkspaces, and employee communication. Additionally, our employee experience platform, Workvivo, deepened our\ncommitment to creating a platform that is focused on connecting and engaging employees.\nUnlike most Contact Center as a Service (“CCaaS”) solutions that are only optimized for voice, Zoom Contact Center\nis an omnichannel cloud contact center platform that is optimized for video and intentionally supports a robust\nsuite of channels, such as voice and video, SMS, and webchat. The result is a one-stop shop designed for customer\nexperience leaders to deliver excellence to their customers and to strengthen workforce engagement.\nThe happiness we deliver is recognized by our customers. Zoom has consistently earned high scores across customer\nreview sites, Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2, including being recognized as a 2024 Customers’ Choice in\nthe Gartner Peer Insight “Voice of the Customer” for Unified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) and Visual\nCollaboration Applications, and a Leader badge for Zoom Contact Center by G2. Industry analysts also recognize our\nmarket leadership across our platform and products: Gartner has named Zoom a leader in the Magic Quadrant for UCaaS\nfor the fourth year in a row, and Workvivo was named a leader in the Magic Quadrant for Intranet Packaged\nSolutions. Forrester published its Forrester Wave for Conversational Intelligence, where Zoom Revenue Accelerator\ndebuted as a “Strong” player. IDC named Zoom Events as a leader in its IDC MarketScape for Worldwide Virtual Events\nApplications. Zoom Workplace was also named Editor’s Choice and one of the Best Products and Services of the Year\n(2024) by PC Mag, included in Fast Company’s 2024 Most Innovative Companies list, and awarded CRN Tech Innovators\nAward for Zoom AI Companion, as well as Best Unified Communications Platform >$250m, Best UCaaS Provider AMERICAS,\nBest Collaboration Platform, and Best Hybrid Workplace Product from UC Today.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:\nKeep our existing customers happy. We deliver happiness to our customers by giving them experiences that add\nmeaningful business value and delight them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user\nexperiences. We believe these practices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to\ngenerate referrals from our existing customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.\nDrive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nusers to our platform, we promote usage that allows them and their meeting attendees to experience the Zoom\ndifference. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that integrates\nthe viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales representatives, online\nchannel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach is designed to allow us to cost-effectively drive\nupgrades to our paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.\nInnovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of communication,\ncollaboration, and AI technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion\nof our engineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our\ncustomer base. Our core areas of focus are bolstering innovation on products in the following categories: employee\nexperience, customer experience, core communications, generative AI and departmental and industry-specific\nsolutions.\nDrive international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world, we\nare poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization\nrequirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a\nfew language adjustments to our user interface and support systems. Zoom continues to make meetings more effective\nand inclusive with new language captions and translations. Within a Zoom Meeting, translated captions will\ntranslate the source language into English captions or translate from English to the language selected by the\nmeeting participant. Translated captions support more than 35 languages. This facilitates seamless collaboration\nand helps to improve attendee engagement, including after the meeting, through AI Companion summaries.\nExpand within existing customers. As organizations experience our platform and become familiar with its benefits,\nmore teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and\nthen organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest\ndeployments. Customers are also purchasing services for events, webinars, room solutions, phone, contact center,\nand employee experience, creating a complete and integrated set of communications services.\n7\nTable of Contents\nGrow our developer ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Through the Zoom Developer ecosystem, we enable\ncustomers and their developers to build their own solutions with our underlying platform technology, seamlessly\nembed our platform into their own offerings, and integrate their applications across Zoom products using our\nextensive library of application program interfaces (“APIs”) and selection of software development kits (“SDKs”).\nOur app marketplace further extends the value and adoption of Zoom with our customers through the development and\ndistribution of apps and integrations. We continue to partner with video conferencing hardware and peripheral\nproviders, as well as with software providers, including Palo Alto Networks, Zendesk, and Box.\nOur Platform\nWe provide an open, AI-first work platform for human connection that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes\nhow people interact, connecting them through frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and\nmore. Our products are grouped under the following categories, which are further described below:\nAI - Zoom AI Companion drives impact with intelligence\nZoom Workplace - Enables seamless collaboration and productivity on a unified platform\nZoom Business Services - Strengthens customer relationships and delivers superior service\nEmployee Experience - Makes teamwork more meaningful and engaging\nDeveloper Ecosystem - Creates custom integrations and streamlines workflows\nAI\nZoom AI Companion\nZoom AI Companion, launched in September 2023, is Zoom’s generative AI digital assistant, designed to be seamlessly\nembedded across Zoom's suite of products to deliver real-time digital assistance and enhance productivity. It works\neffortlessly across Zoom Meetings, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Email, Zoom Whiteboard, and Zoom Events and more. Zoom AI\nCompanion uses a federated AI approach that incorporates Zoom’s own LLMs with third-party models to deliver high-\nquality results and lower customer costs. Zoom AI Companion is included at no additional cost for customers with\npaid services in their Zoom user accounts.\nZoom Workplace\nZoom Meetings\nZoom Meetings provides HD video, voice, chat, and content sharing across mobile devices, desktops, laptops,\ntelephones, and conference room systems. Our architecture can support up to 1,000 video participants in a single\nmeeting. Conversations can be one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many. Zoom Meetings feature a 49-person video\ngallery view, virtual backgrounds, MP4/M4A cloud/local recording with transcripts, video breakout rooms, screen\nsharing with annotation, and integrations with other powerful business applications to help teams get more done\ntogether. Zoom Meetings integrate with tools created by companies such as Atlassian, Box, Dropbox, Google,\nLinkedIn, Microsoft, Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Slack. Our meetings are a flexible tool for on-the-go employees\nwho rely on their mobile devices or tablets throughout their business day.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 1000 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same 256-bit AES GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by\ndefault, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to\ndistribute these keys to the other meeting participants. Additionally, a customer-managed key (“CMK”) service\nallows organizations to provide and manage their own encryption keys for certain customer content stored at rest in\nthe Zoom Cloud. The organization needs to manage the keys in the Amazon Web Services Key Management Service. This\nallows for encryption of applicable content stored in the Zoom Cloud using the keys that the organization controls.\nWe believe Zoom was also the first UCaaS company to offer post-quantum E2EE solution video conferencing. Post-\nquantum E2EE works across Zoom Workplace, and employs upgraded algorithms designed to be able to withstand the\npotential future threats of quantum computers.\nTranslated captions help to remove language barriers, connect people, and promote inclusivity in meetings and\nwebinars. Zoom Meetings currently offers translated captions in 35 languages.\nZoom Phone\n8\nTable of Contents\nZoom Phone is a cloud phone system for businesses that provides private branch exchange (“PBX”) features, such as\nsecure call routing, call queuing, call detail reports, call recording, call quality monitoring, voicemail, switch\nto video, and much more.

          "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nsecurities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business depends on our ability to attract new customers, retain and upsell additional products and new product\ncategories to existing customers, and upgrade free users to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers,\nrenewals, or upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers, and maintain and expand our relationships with our\nexisting customers, including upselling additional products and new product categories to our existing customers\nand upgrading users from a free plan to one of our paid offerings.\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. Customers may also terminate or reduce the size of their\nexisting subscriptions. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers will renew their subscriptions\nutilizing the same tier of plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier, or purchase additional products, if they renew at\nall. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, such as\ndissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer no longer having a need for our products, or a belief\nthat a competitor’s product is better, more secure, or less expensive than our products and platform. For example,\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions. As a result, our customer\nbase shifted largely from businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. Following\nthe pandemic, some of our customers reduced or discontinued their use of our platform, and additional customers may\ndo so in the future. Additionally, this shift in mix has resulted and may continue to result in higher non-renewal\nrates than we have experienced in the past. Renewals are also impacted by reductions in customer information\ntechnology spending budgets or a decision by the customer to consolidate their spending budgets on one of our\ncompetitor’s platforms, both of which are more likely to occur during periods of high inflation or recessionary or\nuncertain economic environments. We must continually add new customers and licenses to grow our business and to\nreplace customers and licenses who choose not to continue to use our platform. Finally, any decrease in user\nsatisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand, word-of-mouth referrals, and ability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage users of our free offering to upgrade to one\nof our paid offerings by recommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications.\nHowever, free users may never upgrade to one of our paid offerings. We also seek to expand within organizations by\nadding new licenses, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of our platform into\nother teams and departments within an organization. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade free users to one\nof our paid offerings or expand the number of licenses within organizations, our business would be harmed.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and may continue to decline in future periods.\nOur revenue growth has fluctuated in prior periods. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior\nquarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. There are no assurances we will be able to\nsustain our revenue growth in future periods, and our revenue growth rate may continue to remain flat or decline in\nfuture periods. Many factors have and may contribute to declines in our growth rate, including higher market\npenetration, increased competition, macroeconomic conditions, such as inflation, recessionary or uncertain economic\nenvironments, fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, slowing demand for our platform, a lower than\nanticipated capitalization on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our business, among others. Our growth\nrate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our business and the trading price of our Class A common\nstock could be adversely affected.\n14\nTable of Contents\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers or cloud hosting services and a\nvariety of other factors, would impair the delivery of our services, require us to issue credits or pay penalties,\nand harm our business.\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\ncloud hosting services such as Amazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of\nour business and Microsoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed\nmeeting architecture, we establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between\nvarious data centers. Damage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past resulted in and could in the\nfuture result in interruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future\nexperience, other interruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety of other factors, including, but not\nlimited to, infrastructure changes, vendor (including cloud hosting) issues, human or software errors, viruses,\nsecurity attacks, ransomware or cyber extortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in usage,\nlocal administrative actions, changes to legal or permitting requirements, and denial of service issues. In some\ninstances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these problems within an acceptable period of\ntime. For example, we have experienced partial outages in our services that impacted a subset of our users for a\nlimited number of hours. Additionally, in connection with the addition of new data centers or expansion or\nconsolidation of our existing data center facilities or other reasons, we may move or transfer our data and our\nusers’ metadata to other data centers, not including our China data center. Despite precautions that we take during\nthis process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our service, and\nwe may incur significant costs in connection with any such move or transfer. Interruptions, delays, or outages in\nour services would reduce our revenue; may require us to issue credits or pay penalties; may subject us to claims\nand litigation; and may cause customers to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to\nattract new customers. Our ability to attract and retain customers and licenses depends on our ability to provide\ncustomers and users with a highly reliable platform and even minor interruptions or delays in our services could\nharm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers or cloud hosting services are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for\ncapacity, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service as we seek to obtain additional capacity,\nwhich could result in the loss of customers who use our unified communications and collaboration platform because\nof its reliability and performance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new co-located data centers\nthroughout the world to meet increased demand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a\ntimely manner, including as a result of current shortages for certain parts, such as servers.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities and cloud hosting services we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error;\nintentional bad acts; earthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware\nfailures; systems failures; telecommunications failures; disease; and other public health related measures, any of\nwhich could disrupt our service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers or\ndisruption of the cloud hosting services we use, it may take a significant period of time to achieve full\nresumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for all eventualities. Despite\nprecautions taken at these data center facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or\nother act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated\nproblems at the facilities would harm our business.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing and\nincludes companies ranging from new market entrants to hyperscalers that provide technologies to improve\ncommunication and collaboration technologies platforms either as bundled solutions or standalone products. Given\nthe range of companies in this space, maintaining an open and robust marketplace with fair competition is\nimportant. Certain features of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies\nmarket with products offered by:\nbundled productivity suite providers with communication offerings, including Microsoft 365 (with Teams) and\nGoogle Workspace (with Meet);\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and\nFacebook.\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services into our platform, and with the introduction of new technologies and market\nentrants, including AI, we expect competition to continue to intensify.\n15\nTable of Contents\nIn February 2022, we launched Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for\nvideo, which competes against companies that offer similar services, such as Five9, Genesys, and NICE inContact,\nand new competitors that may enter that market in the future. As we continue to build out our platform, we may face\nincreased competition against companies that offer similar services and new competitors that may enter that market\nin the future. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from smaller\ncustomers, many of whom are consumers or small and medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller\ncustomers, we face competition from more consumer-oriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the\nconsumer market than we do. Further, many of our actual and potential competitors benefit from competitive\nadvantages over us, such as greater name recognition; longer operating histories; more varied products and\nservices; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing, customers and partner relationships; more third-\nparty integrations; greater accessibility across devices and applications; greater access to larger user bases;\nmajor distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater financial, technical, and\nother resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or strategic investments or enter into strategic\nrelationships to offer a broader range of products and services than we do, which may prevent us from using such\nthird parties' technology or offering such products or services. These combinations may make it more difficult for\nus to compete effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain\ntheir market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their needs. In some cases, we have been forced to engage in price-cutting\ninitiatives or other discounts to attract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, and may have\nto do so in the future. We, on occasion, offer customers a free period of time at the beginning of the subscription\nterm that can result in deferred billings or long-term accounts receivable and increase the risk of loss on\nuncollected accounts receivable.\nOur results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly, and period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter should\nnot be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our results of operations may fluctuate as a result of a\nvariety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business. For example, during fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in usage of our\nunified communications and collaboration platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of\nwhich was attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet this increased demand, we\nhave incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our infrastructure and\nexpanding our capacity. Fluctuations in our results may negatively impact the value of our securities. Factors that\nmay cause fluctuations in our results of operations include, without limitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced plans;\nour ability to attract new customers and upgrade free users to one of our paid offerings;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\nthe length of our sales cycles and linearity of our bookings, especially with respect to sales to large\nenterprises and highly regulated industries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign\ngovernmental agencies;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases, and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\n16\nTable of Contents\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service, network outages, or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits, regulatory actions or investigations, legislator scrutiny, or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nOur business may be significantly affected by changes in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer or\nbusiness spending.\nOur business may be significantly affected by changes in the economy, such as high inflation and the responses by\ncentral banking authorities to control such inflation, recessionary or uncertain environments, fluctuations in the\nforeign currency exchange rates and geopolitical tensions and military conflicts, including the ongoing conflicts\nbetween Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East, and tariffs and trade tensions, including the United States'\nongoing trade disputes with China and other countries. While some customers may view a subscription to our platform\nas a cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others may view a subscription to our platform\nas a discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their information technology spending on our platform\nduring an economic downturn or during times of economic uncertainty. Given current economic conditions, including\ninflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience a loss of users and customers, as well as a reduction\nin demand for our platform, especially if the effects of the current economic environment have a prolonged impact\non various industries that our unified communications and collaboration platform addresses. In addition to the\nforegoing, adverse developments that affect financial institutions, transactional counterparties or other third\nparties, such as bank failures, or concerns or speculation about any similar events or risks, could lead to market-\nwide liquidity problems, which in turn may cause third parties, including customers, to become unable to meet their\nobligations under various types of financial arrangements as well as general disruptions or instability in the\nfinancial markets. Moreover, we have lost and may continue to lose customers as a result of such customers ceasing\nto do business, and we have experienced and may continue to experience a material increase in longer payment cycles\nand greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable from certain customers. These issues may continue in the\nfuture if current economic conditions continue or worsen.\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles have and could continue to lengthen, and we could\nexperience greater deployment challenges.\nWe invest significant resources into sales to large organizations. Large organizations typically undertake a\nsignificant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organizational structure, and approval\nrequirements, all of which have and may continue to lengthen our sales cycle. We have also faced and may in the\nfuture face unexpected deployment challenges with large organizations or more complicated deployment of some or all\naspects of our platform. Large organizations may demand additional features, support services and pricing\nconcessions, or require additional security management or control features. We may spend substantial time, effort,\nand money on sales efforts to large organizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or\nthat these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial\nup-front investment. As a result, we anticipate increased sales to large organizations will lead to higher up-front\nsales costs and greater unpredictability in our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is\n17\nTable of Contents\ncritical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies market fails to\ngrow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our platform could be negatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\na reduction in customer information technology spending budgets, or a consolidation of spending budgets on our\ncompetitors' platforms, especially during periods of inflation or recessionary or uncertain economic environments;\nease of adoption and use;\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and there are no assurances we will be able to maintain or increase\nprofitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses in the future. We intend to continue to expend\nsignificant funds on our sales and marketing efforts to attract new customers, expand the number of licenses and\nservices used by our customers and develop and enhance our products. We also intend to continue investing in\ngeneral corporate purposes, including operations, hiring additional personnel, including through acquisitions of\nother businesses, upgrading our infrastructure, addressing security and privacy issues, and expanding into new\ngeographies and markets. To the extent we are successful in increasing our customer base, we may also incur\nincreased losses because, other than sales commissions, the costs associated with acquiring customers are generally\nincurred up front, while the subscription revenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term, which\ncan be monthly, annual, or on a multiyear basis. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect,\nand we may not be able to increase our revenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses, which may result in\ndecreased profitability. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a\nresult of the other risks described herein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other\nunknown events. While free users continue to be a meaningful portion of the user base, we have directed marketing\nprograms focused on converting free users to paid subscriptions. Some of these users have upgraded to a paid plan\nbut the remainder have not and may never do so. If we are unable to increase or sustain our profitability, the\nvalue of our business and Class A common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict\nthe size and growth rate of our market, customer demand for our platform, customer adoption and renewal of our\nplatform, the entry of competitive products and services, or the success of existing competitive products and\nservices. As a result, we may not be able to increase or maintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to\ngrow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of\n18\nTable of Contents\nour platform across these and other third-party operating systems and applications that we do not control, and some\nof these third parties can make it more difficult for our platform to interoperate with their systems in favor of\ncompetitive platforms. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other productivity software,\nit is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors own, develop, operate,\nor distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other software, and also have\nmaterial business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems,\napplications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform requires in order to\noperate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and services that more\ntightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business partners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products\nevolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors modify their products or\nstandards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to\ncompetitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the\ninteroperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Workplace product integrates with tools offered by\ncompanies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and\nexpand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are\nquality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’\nsolutions, our business will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple recently began requiring mobile applications using its\niOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising\nidentifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other privacy and regulatory changes remains\nuncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app stores, we could lose access to the app\nstore and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our customer base and increase our revenue will\ndepend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and products; and\ninteroperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications. Our customers\nmay require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. In particular, advancements in\ntechnology such as AI and machine learning are changing the way people work, and businesses that are slow to adopt\nthese new technologies may face a competitive disadvantage. We invest significantly in research and development,\nand our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality and ease of adoption, enhance privacy and\nsecurity, and create organic demand for our platform. There is no assurance that new additions or other future\nenhancements to our platform or new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be compelling to our\ncustomers or gain market acceptance, or that they will perform as expected. If our research and development\ninvestments do not accurately anticipate demand or if we fail to develop our platform in a manner that satisfies\ncustomer preferences and requirements in a timely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing\ncustomers or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings, such as AI-powered communication and collaboration tools, could make our platform\nobsolete or adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. We may experience\ndifficulties with software development, design, or marketing that could delay or prevent our development,\nintroduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features, or capabilities. We have in the past\nexperienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and capabilities and there can be no\nassurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released according to schedule. Any\ndelays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or claims by users brought against\nus, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to our platform may require\nsubstantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful. If customers and users\ndo not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not perform as expected, we\nmay not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop, license, or acquire new\nfeatures and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such enhancements do not\nachieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\n19\nTable of Contents\nWe use generative AI including in our products and services, which may result in operational challenges, legal\nliability, reputational concerns, competitive risks and regulatory concerns that could adversely affect our\nbusiness and results of operations.\nWe use generative AI processes and algorithms, including by deploying generative AI features in our products and\nservices, which may result in adverse effects to our operations, legal liability, reputation and competitive risks.\nThe use of generative and agentic AI at scale is relatively new, and may lead to challenges, concerns and risks\nthat are significant or that we may not be able to predict. For example, AI algorithms use machine learning (“ML”)\nand predictive analytics which may be insufficient, biased, inaccurate or of poor quality, which could result in\ncustomer rejection or skepticism of our products, adversely impact the rights of individuals, affect our reputation\nor brand, and negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, we rely on third parties for certain AI\nfeatures of our products and if such third parties do not provide us those features (or do not do so on acceptable\nterms), experience interruptions, or cease operating, we may need to work with another provider, which may take\ntime or may not be possible, and could result in the disruption of certain of our products or services, affect our\nreputation or brand, and negatively affect our financial results. We could also face claims from third parties\nclaiming infringement of their intellectual property or other proprietary rights with respect to materials used or\ncreated by generative or agentic AI tools or features that we believed to be available for use and not subject to\nsuch rights. The investment required to bring AI features to market and the costs associated with providing these\nfeatures to our customers may be significant, and we may be unable to recover these costs if customers and users do\nnot widely adopt these features. We currently offer our AI features at no additional cost, as we believe they will\nultimately enhance user satisfaction, improve customer retention, and drive revenue. If such benefits are not\nrealized, the associated investment costs could further negatively impact our margins. Further, use of generative\nAI tools by our employees or others could result in disclosure of confidential or sensitive company and customer\ndata, reputational harm, and legal liability.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and services will\ndepend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan to continue\nexpanding our sales and marketing capabilities, including through strategic partners, both domestically and\ninternationally. If we are unable to expand our sales and marketing operations, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources, as the cost to acquire\ncustomers through these efforts is high. Our business will be harmed if our efforts do not generate a\ncorrespondingly significant increase in revenue.\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers to switch to our competitors, or to cancel\ntheir subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaboration technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users has grown and their\nusage of communications capacity has increased, we have been required to make additional investments in network\ncapacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of\nwhich may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity does not continue to be available to us to support\nour user base in the future, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission\ncapacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third parties providing\ninternet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not have access to our\nplatform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate of adoption of new\ntechnologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently adapt to the increased\ndemand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause current or potential\nusers to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid\nour platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party\n20\nTable of Contents\nservices, including our platform, by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or\nfacilitate third-party services or by charging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party\nservices, any of which would make our platform less attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, a regulatory regime generally referred to as network neutrality, subject\nto certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The order requires broadband providers to publicly\ndisclose accurate information regarding network management practices, performance characteristics, and commercial\nterms of their broadband internet access services sufficient to enable consumers to make informed choices regarding\nthe purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and other small businesses to develop, market, and\nmaintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June 11, 2018. Numerous parties filed judicial\nchallenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia\nCircuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to the new rules, but reversed the FCC’s\ndecision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband internet service, requiring case-by-case\ndeterminations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the FCC’s rules. The court also required the\nFCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to remain in effect, while the FCC conducts that\nreview. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that the three issues remanded by the court did\nnot provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018 order. On October 19, 2023, the FCC adopted a notice of\nproposed rulemaking proposing to reinstate the 2015 rules, and on April 24, 2024, adopted an order that\nsubstantially reinstated those rules. On January 2, 2025, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit issued a\ndecision overturning the FCC order. That decision remains subject to potential further appeals. We cannot predict\nthe impact of the new rules on our operations or business.\nIn addition, a number of states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that\nwould regulate the conduct of broadband providers, including legislation to impose state-level network requirements\nin New York. After a federal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-\nspecific network neutrality law, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. A number of other states\nhave adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of\nbroadband providers. A similar law in Vermont is subject to a pending challenge, but went into effect on April 20,\n2022 and the challenge has been suspended until an appeal in another case addressing state powers to adopt internet\nregulation is resolved. The FCC’s April 24 order, which, as described above, was overturned by the Sixth Circuit\nCourt of Appeals, permits it to preempt any state-level network neutrality requirements that go beyond the\nrequirements adopted in that order, but specifically held that the California law would not be preempted. We cannot\npredict whether the FCC order or other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated by\nlegal action of the court, federal legislation, or the FCC. Under the FCC’s 2018 rules, which currently remain in\neffect, broadband internet access providers may be able to charge web-based services such as ours for priority\naccess or favor services offered by our competitors or by the internet access providers themselves, which could\nresult in increased costs and a loss of existing customers, impair our ability to attract new customers, and harm\nour business but the 2024 rules, if they go into effect, are intended to limit the ability of broadband internet\naccess providers to engage in such behavior.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\noverturned, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur security measures, and those of third parties with whom we work, have been compromised in the past and may be\ncompromised in the future. If our security measures are compromised in the future or if our information technology\nfails, this could harm our reputation, expose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our\nbusiness. In addition, if our products and services are perceived as not being secure, this could result in\ncustomers and users curtailing or ceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our\nbusiness being harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties with whom we work collect, receive, store,\nprocess, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share\nconfidential, proprietary, and sensitive data, including data of ours, our customers, and our users, the data which\nincludes personal information, customer and user content, health-related data, intellectual property, trade\nsecrets, business plans, and financial information. We and the third parties upon which we rely face a variety of\nevolving threats, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, which could cause security incidents. We\nroutinely investigate security incidents, which have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, that result\nin unauthorized access to, loss or unauthorized disclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of confidential,\nproprietary, and sensitive information.\nCyberattacks, other malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities\nthreaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data and\ninformation technology systems, and those of the third parties with whom we work. Cloud-based platform providers of\nproducts and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. Threats are prevalent and continue to\nrise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and\n21\nTable of Contents\ncome from a variety of sources, including traditional computer “hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized\ncriminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation-state and nation-state\nsupported actors, and advanced persistent threat intrusions. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to\nengage in cyberattacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in\nconjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and\nthe third parties with whom we work may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, which could materially\ndisrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to provide our services. We and the third parties\nwith whom we work are subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social-engineering\nattacks (including through deep fakes, which may be increasingly more difficult to identify as fake, and phishing\nattacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat\nintrusions), denial-of-service attacks, credential stuffing, personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks,\nsoftware bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology\nassets, adware, telecommunications failures, attacks enhanced or facilitated by AI, earthquakes, fires, floods, and\nother similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-\nstates, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and severe and can lead to\nsignificant interruptions in our operations or our ability to provide our products or services, loss of data and\nincome, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a\nransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or\nregulations prohibiting such payments. Additionally, our platform, products, and services are relied on by a large\nnumber of companies worldwide and as a result, if our platform, products, or solutions are compromised, a\nsignificant number or all of our customers and their data could be simultaneously affected. The potential liability\nand associated consequences we could suffer as a result of such a large-scale event could be catastrophic and\nresult in irreparable harm.\nFuture or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional\ncybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in\nacquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, we have discovered, and may in the future\ndiscover security issues that were not found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it\nmay be difficult to integrate companies into our information technology environment and security program.\nIn addition, our reliance on third parties has in the past and could continue to introduce new cybersecurity risks\nand vulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other threats to our business operations. We rely on third\nparties to operate critical business systems to process confidential, proprietary, and sensitive data in a variety\nof contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center facilities, encryption and\nauthentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, and other functions. We also rely on\nthird parties to provide other products, services and parts, or otherwise to operate our business. Our ability to\nmonitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have\nadequate information security measures in place. If the third parties with whom we work experience a security\nincident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we may be entitled to damages if\nthe third parties with whom we work fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related obligations to us, any award\nmay be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award. In addition, supply-chain\nattacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third parties’ infrastructure in our\nsupply chain or that of the third parties with whom we work supply chains have not been compromised.\nIf our security measures are compromised, as has occurred in the past, our reputation could be damaged; our data,\ninformation or intellectual property, or that of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised;\nour business may be harmed; and we could incur significant liability. We take steps designed to detect and\nremediate vulnerabilities in our information systems and those of third parties with whom we work, but we may not\ndetect or remediate all such vulnerabilities or do so in a timely manner. The threats and techniques used to\nexploit vulnerabilities change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature, and may be difficult to detect by\nsecurity tools. Vulnerabilities could be exploited and result in a security incident. We have limited budgetary and\nhuman resources for detecting and remediating vulnerabilities and have experienced difficulties in hiring and\nretaining qualified security personnel, especially after our recent restructuring actions. We may experience delays\nin developing and deploying remedial measures, including patches, designed to address identified vulnerabilities,\nand our remedial measures may require action by our customers such as installing patches or updates, which may\nincrease the amount of time a vulnerability remains unremediated. We have not always been able in the past and may\nbe unable in the future to anticipate or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in\nour information systems or third-party software, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise our systems.\nIn addition, security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to\nactively search for and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software or services. This activity may\nincrease because of increased demand for our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified communications\nand collaboration platform, and can lead to additional adverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats,\nbusiness and operational interruptions, security incidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions, and substantial harm to our business, some of which we have experienced. For example,\nin July 2019, a security researcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the Zoom Meeting platform,\nincluding certain video-on features. We were able to release updates to the software addressing these\n22\nTable of Contents\nvulnerabilities, and we are not aware of any customers being affected or meetings compromised by these\nvulnerabilities. In most cases customers are responsible for installing this update to the software, and their\nsoftware is subject to these vulnerabilities until they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security researcher\nreported certain vulnerabilities related to our macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized person to\ngain root access to a user’s system. Given the nature of our business and operations, our products and services\nwill inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects that have not been identified or remediated\nand cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We have identified high or critical vulnerabilities in our\nproducts, services and information systems in the past, and we expect that we will continue to identify such\nvulnerabilities in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to address any vulnerabilities in our\nproducts, services and information systems that we may become aware of in the future, or there may be delays in\ndeveloping patches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities.\nWe will continue to make prioritization decisions based on, among other things, our available resources, the\nefficacy of our security tools, and the increasing workload to meet certain security obligations, to determine\nwhich vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit\nthat compromises security. In some cases, customers are responsible for installing our software updates, and until\nthey do so, their service remains subject to the vulnerabilities addressed in the software update. Vulnerabilities\nand critical security defects, errors in remediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party\nproviders to remediate vulnerabilities or security defects, or customers not deploying security releases or\ndeciding not to install software updates could result in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or\notherwise harm our business.\nSecurity incidents and vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and information security\nmay also prevent some of our customers and users from using or cause some of our customers and users to stop using\nour solutions and fail to upgrade or renew their subscriptions. Failures to meet customers’ and users’ expectations\nwith respect to security and confidentiality of their data and information could damage our reputation and affect\nour ability to retain customers and users, attract new customers and users, and grow our business.\nIn addition, cybersecurity events or security vulnerabilities could result in breaches of our agreements with\ncustomers, lawsuits against us (including class action litigation), regulatory investigations or actions, and\nsignificant increases in costs, including costs for remediating the effects of such an event or vulnerability, lost\nrevenue due to network downtime, and a decrease in customer and user trust, increases in insurance premiums due to\ncybersecurity incidents, increased costs to address cybersecurity issues, and attempts to prevent future incidents,\nfines, penalties, judgments and settlements, and attorney fees, and harm to our business and our reputation because\nof any such incident.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that\ncould result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration,\nencryption, disclosure of, or access to confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data or our information technology\nsystems, or those of the third parties with whom we work A security incident or other interruption could disrupt\nour ability (and that of third parties with whom we work) to provide our services. We expend significant resources\nor modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Additionally, certain privacy, data\nprotection, and information security obligations require us to implement and maintain certain security measures or\nindustry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive data.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents, including\nthose recently promulgated by the SEC. These laws may also require us to take certain measures, such as providing\ncredit monitoring to individuals. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data\nbreach is costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse\nconsequences. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches.\nActual or perceived security gaps or security compromises experienced in our industry or by our competitors, our\ncustomers, a third party with whom we work, or us could cause us to experience adverse consequences, such as\ngovernment enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional\nreporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal\ninformation); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational\nharm; monetary fund diversions; diversion of management attention; interruptions in our operations (including\navailability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security incidents and attendant consequences may\ncause customers to stop using our services, deter new customers from using our services, and negatively impact our\nability to grow and operate our business.\nIn addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States, like many similarly situated\ntechnology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel outside of the United States,\nincluding in China, which has exposed and could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as\nmarket and media scrutiny regarding the actual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy\nfeatures.\n23\nTable of Contents\nIncreased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand has led\nand could in the future lead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our\ninformation security and potential vulnerabilities associated with our platform. For example, during the COVID-19\npandemic, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users, leading to challenges for users who\ndid not have full IT support or established protocols for security and privacy like our larger customers. As a\nresult, we have experienced negative publicity related to meeting disruptions and security and privacy issues,\nincluding on encryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could result in material reputational harm, a loss\nof customer and user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation exposure, additional expenses, and other harm\nto our business.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of use\nor other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities or\ndamages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability insurance\ncoverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on acceptable terms\nor will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer will not deny\ncoverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are not\ncovered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including\npremium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our business.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers and users\nand, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad communications and\ncollaboration platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users view the Zoom brand primarily\nas a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform that connects people through video,\nvoice, chat and content sharing, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market\nposition may be detrimentally impacted. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive,\nmaintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or\nperception of our platform, including from any delays or interruptions in service due to capacity constraints\nstemming from increased usage, from our privacy or security features, because of sentiment towards the providers of\ncommunication and collaboration technologies generally, or from our integration of new product functionalities\nusing technologies with heightened public interest, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to\nattract and retain customers. Similarly, any unfavorable perception of our company, including due to any actual or\nperceived violation by our employees of our policies, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause\nus reputational harm and customer loss, impact our financial performance, expose us to litigation, and harm our\nbusiness, among other things. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom brand, including consumer and public\nperception of our platform or our company, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business will be\nharmed.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be\nharmed.\nWhile our employee headcount both in the United States and internationally has generally increased over time, we\nhave undertaken, and may undertake from time to time in the future, restructuring actions to better align our\nfinancial model. For example, in February 2023, we commenced certain restructuring actions, designed to reduce\noperating costs and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth.\nThese organizational changes may not achieve or sustain the targeted benefits, or the benefits, even if achieved,\nmay not be adequate to meet our long-term profitability and operational expectations. Steps we take to manage our\nbusiness operations, including workplace policies for employees, and to align our operations with our strategies\nfor future growth, may adversely affect our reputation and brand, our ability to recruit, retain and motivate\nhighly skilled personnel. Additionally, while we expect to continue to grow our business and operations over time,\nwe have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties frequently experienced by\ngrowing companies in rapidly changing industries. Our ability to manage our growth and business operations\neffectively and to integrate new employees, technologies and acquisitions into our existing business will require\nus to continue to expend resources to support our global user-base and to retain, attract, train, motivate and\nmanage employees. This places a continuous, significant strain on our management, operational, and financial\nresources. If we fail to achieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are\nnot able to accurately forecast future growth, our business would be harmed.\n24\nTable of Contents\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing customers and make it more difficult to attract new customers;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, Europe,\nMiddle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). All of our executive officers are at-will employees,\nand we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Any changes in our senior management team in\nparticular, even in the ordinary course of business, including the transition of our Chief Financial Officer in\n2024, may be disruptive to our business. Such changes may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause\ndisruptions to our business. If our senior management team fails to work together effectively or execute our plans\nand strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover or otherwise, our business could be harmed.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly-qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all, which may be exacerbated by our recent restructuring actions and any\nsimilar future actions. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be altered to\naddress a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in a timely\nmanner. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience employee turnover as a result of our recent\nrestructuring actions. New hires require training and take time before they achieve full productivity. New\nemployees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of\nqualified individuals. If we fail to attract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel,\nour business could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be\n25\nTable of Contents\nthreatened with legal action under agreements with their existing employers if we attempt to hire them, which could\nimpact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and resources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as\nrestrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to recruit internationally. We must also continue to retain and\nmotivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development\nopportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\nIn addition, as our stock price has fluctuated since our initial public offering (“IPO”), employees joining us at\ndifferent times could have significant disparities in proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business. Further, the volatility of our stock price may make our equity compensation less\nattractive to current and potential employees, and could contribute to increased turnover or difficulties in\nhiring.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 28.2% and 28.7%, and\n30.5% of our revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Our customers\ninclude multinational corporations with global users, and we expect to continue to expand our international\noperations, which includes opening offices in new jurisdictions and providing our platform in additional languages\nto support the needs of these multinational corporations. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to\nallow users to access our services or sell subscriptions to our platform may not be receptive. If we are not able\nto satisfy certain government- and industry-specific requirements, we have in the past and may in the future\nexperience service outages or other adverse consequences, including interference with our local operations or\nrestrictions on our ability to continue our operations in certain jurisdictions, that would impair our ability to\noperate or expand further into certain markets. As an example, if local or national Chinese government agencies\ninterfered with or placed restrictions on our research and development operations in China, our ability to design\nnew products, features, and functionality on a timely basis or at all, or our ability to effectively deliver our\nservices, would be adversely impacted as a significant portion of our research and development organization resides\nin China. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally in the future\nrequires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting\na rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory\nsystems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international expansion will require\ninvestment of significant funds and other resources. We also face risks related to recruiting and retaining\ntalented and capable employees outside the United States, including complying with complex employment- and\ncompensation-related laws, regulations, and practices in these international jurisdictions, and maintaining our\ncompany culture across all of our offices. We may also be unable to grant equity compensation to employees in\ncertain countries outside of the United States due to the complexities of local laws and regulations. This may\nrequire us to offer equally compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash\ncompensation plans or increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees\nin these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and increases risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection, automatic\nrenewals, and unsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees\nif our practices are deemed to be out of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices or develop new products, features, and functionality;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as the United States;\n26\nTable of Contents\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our intellectual property that resides outside of the United States, such as\nthe risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual property outside of the\nforeign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\npolitical and economic instability and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the continuing deterioration in diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and China, or deterioration in diplomatic relations between the United States and\ncountries with which the United States has traditionally enjoyed close ties and alliances, and the ongoing\nconflicts between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of recent macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, recessionary environments, recent\nbank failures and related uncertainties, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, weighing on our\ncustomers' ability to pay for our service on a timely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nAs described above, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, European\nUnion, and other nations announced various sanctions against Russia and export restrictions against Russia and\nBelarus. Such restrictions include blocking sanctions on some of the largest state-owned and private Russian\nfinancial institutions, and their removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or\nthe SWIFT, payment system. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be\ntaken in future, by the United States, NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could\nresult in a regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, including preventing us from performing existing contracts, pursuing new\nbusiness opportunities, or receiving payments for services already provided to customers.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. In addition, legal requirements in the United States and other\ncountries may come into conflict with each other making it challenging or impossible to comply with both countries’\nlegal requirements simultaneously. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal\npenalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and regulations\nor manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease operations in\ncertain foreign jurisdictions.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, and any failure to comply with such laws\ncould harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices\nAct of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-bribery and\nanti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their employees and\nintermediaries, from directly or indirectly authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or benefits to\ngovernment officials and other recipients for improper purposes. The FCPA also requires public companies to make\nand keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation and to devise and\nmaintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we take precautions to prevent violations of\nanti-corruption laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as\n27\nTable of Contents\nwe continue to expand our international presence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business,\nfinancial condition, and results of operations.\nGeopolitical tension between the United States and China, or between other economies, such as Taiwan, and China,\nmay intensify and lead to increased scrutiny of our business operations in China.\nWe have a significant number of employees, primarily engineers, in China, where personnel costs are less expensive\nthan in many other geographies. The number or proportion of our employees in China has fluctuated in the past and\nmay fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including macroeconomic changes and internal restructuring.\nGeopolitical and national security tensions between the United States and China, or between other countries and\nChina, have in the past, currently are and could in the future lead to increased scrutiny of our business\noperations in China and a negative perception among current and potential customers regarding our collection, use,\nstorage, disclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies, any of which may harm our\nreputation and business. Additionally, we may face certain adverse consequences, as a result of geopolitical and\nnational security tensions between the United States and China, including interference with, or restrictions on,\nour local operations that would impair our ability to operate in China. As an example, if local or national Chinese\ngovernment agencies interfered with or placed restrictions on our research and development operations in China, our\nability to design new products, features, and functionality on a timely basis or at all, or our ability to\neffectively deliver our service, would be adversely impacted as a significant portion of our research and\ndevelopment organization resides in China.\nIn June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nEastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of California (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our\ninteractions with foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well\nas about storage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY\nsubpoena requested information about the actions we took responding to law enforcement requests from the Chinese\ngovernment. The NDCA subpoena also requested documents and information about (among other things) contacts between\nour employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any\nforeign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United\nStates. We are fully cooperating with these investigations and have conducted our own thorough internal\ninvestigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we\nwill ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We\ncannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could\ncause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm,\na loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and users could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers who increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced plan must be recognized\nover the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and users may harm our relationships with our customers\nand users and, consequently, our business.\nIncreased user demand for support may result in increased costs that may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, during the COVID-19 pandemic we saw surging demand requiring us to allocate additional resources to\nsupport our expanded customer and user base, including many who were using our platform for the first time, placing\nadditional pressure on our support organization. In addition, as we continue to support our global user base, we\nneed to be able to continue to provide efficient support that meets our customers and users’ needs globally at\nscale. If we are unable to provide efficient user support globally at scale or if we need to hire additional\nsupport personnel, our business may be harmed. Our new customer signups are highly dependent on our business\nreputation and on recommendations from our existing customers and users. Any failure to\n28\nTable of Contents\nmaintain high-quality support, or a market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our\ncustomers and users, would harm our business.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our resellers or potential resellers to\nfavor their products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology, product offerings and processes requires\nsignificant time and resources. For resellers in certain emerging markets, we may be unable to effectively oversee\nand quality check certain processes, such as customer due diligence, which has and may continue to impact such\nresellers’ ability to implement robust customer verification protocols and mitigate fraud risk. If we decide to\nfurther develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and\nprocedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and training. Many resellers may not be\nwilling to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to effectively sell our platform. If we fail\nto maintain relationships with our resellers, develop relationships with new resellers in new markets, expand the\nnumber of resellers in existing markets, or manage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing\nresellers, our ability to increase the number of new customers and increase sales to existing customers could be\nadversely impacted, which would harm our business.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nportion of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the\ncurrencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025,\n2024, and 2023, 19.3%, 19.3%, and 20.0% of our revenue, respectively, and 16.4%, 13.7%, and 10.8% of our expenses,\nrespectively, were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies\nother than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure\nto fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and\nearnings and could materially impact our results of operations. For example, for the fiscal year ended January 31,\n2025, our total revenue was lower than anticipated in part due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar. We do not\ncurrently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities and other government contractors are subject to a number of additional challenges\nand risks.\nWe expect to continue selling our products and services to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency\ncustomers, which may occur through sales to other companies that re-sell our services to government customers\nand/or through direct sales to government entities. While we are a U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) authorized SaaS service, selling to government entities and other government contractors\npresents a number of unique challenges and risks including the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense and ongoing compliance costs without any assurance\nthat these efforts will generate a sale;\ncontracts with governmental entities are subject to termination for the convenience of the customer;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector\nuntil we have attained such certificates;\ncontracts with governmental entities and other government contractors, including resellers in the government\nmarket, contain terms that are less favorable than what we generally agree to in our standard agreements,\nincluding, terms and conditions required by regulation that are not negotiable with the customer;\nnon-compliance with terms and conditions of government contracts, or with representations or certifications made\nin connection with government contracts, can result in significantly more adverse consequences than we typically\nwould\n29\nTable of Contents\nexpect in the commercial market, including, depending on the circumstances, criminal liability, liability under the\ncivil False Claims Act, and/or suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental entities;\nas a U.S. government contractor, we may be subject to executive orders and regulatory changes affecting various\naspects of our operations, including compliance with nondiscrimination plans, and any required elimination or\nmodification of such plans in response to new executive orders could pose challenges in hiring or retaining\nemployees and may lead to other adverse operational impacts, while failure to comply with these requirements could\nexpose us to administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including fines, penalties, repayments or suspension\nor debarment from eligibility for future U.S. government contracts; and\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced, among other things, by public sector budgetary\ncycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector\ndemand for our products.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities and/or other government contractors\nin the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nIn May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional\ninformation technology security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor\nauthentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records\nlaws and other applicable laws. The Executive Order will lead to the development of secure software development\npractices and/or criteria for a consumer software labeling program, which will reflect a baseline level of secure\npractices, for software that is developed and sold to the U.S. federal government. Software developers will be\nrequired to provide visibility into their software and make security data publicly available. Due to this Executive\nOrder, federal agencies may require us to modify our cybersecurity practices and policies, thereby increasing our\ncompliance costs. If we are unable to meet the requirements of the Executive Order, our ability to work with the\nU.S. government may be impaired and may result in a loss of revenue.\nIn January 2025, the current administration began issuing Executive Orders identifying new government policy and\ndirecting U.S. federal agencies to evaluate their current actions, including certain spending, to ensure that such\nactions are consistent with new Administration priorities. Some of those Executive Orders are the subjects of\npending litigation, and there remains significant uncertainty about the ways in which agencies will implement the\nnew Executive Orders. Such implementation could negatively affect our current and future business with U.S.\ngovernment agencies.\nOur current platform, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and users or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and users and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing platform or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, have attracted and may in the future\nattract negative attention if they involve technologies with heightened public interest, may fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and users or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New\nproducts may initially suffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market\nand sell such products to new and existing customers. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our\nproducts, or the introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products,\nincluding those incorporating AI features, fail to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers, or do not\nperform as expected, we may fail to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our\ninvestments in such products, any of which may harm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In\naddition, our current platform, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the\nfuture, may require us to compensate or reimburse third parties. For example, our cloud phone system, Zoom Phone,\nis a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate carriers that operate the PSTN. As a result, a portion of\nthe payments that we will receive from customers who will use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards\ncompensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our margins for Zoom Phone as compared to our other products.\nIn addition, new products that we introduce in the future may similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties, all of which would lower our profit margins for any such new products. If this trend continues with our\nnew and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could harm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid user base to decline significantly.\n30\nTable of Contents\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our\neffective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses;\nchanges in tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to use,\ndeferred tax assets; the applicability of withholding taxes; and effects from acquisitions.\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples, changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, other\nfundamental changes in tax law currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit\nby U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we\ntake, and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our business could be\nadversely impacted.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses\neffective for years beginning after December 31, 2021. The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our cash\ntax liabilities but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction. Although Congress has been considering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to\nlater years, we have no assurance that the provision will be repealed or otherwise modified. Absent a change in\nlegislation, we expect the mandatory capitalization requirement will continue to have a material impact on our cash\nflows.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed or enacted Digital Services Taxes (“DST”), many of which would apply to revenue derived from certain\ndigital services. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions outside of\nthe OECD's Inclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our business by\nincreasing our future tax obligations.\nThe OECD has also been working on a Base Erosion and Profits Shifting project that, upon implementation, would\nchange various aspects of the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined in many of the\ncountries in which we operate. In this regard, the OECD has proposed policies aiming to modernize global tax\nsystems, including a country-by-country 15% minimum effective tax rate (“Pillar Two”) for multinational companies.\nNumerous countries have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, legislation to implement the Pillar Two model\nrules with a subset of the rules becoming effective during our fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, and the\nremaining rules becoming effective for our fiscal year ending January 31, 2026, or in later periods. As these rules\ncontinue to evolve with new legislation and guidance, we will continue to monitor and account for the enactment of\nPillar Two rules in the countries where we operate, and the potential impacts such rules may have on our effective\ntax rate and cash flows in future years.\n31\nTable of Contents\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We\nhave limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not\nbe able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all, due to, among other things, possible delays and\nchallenges in obtaining regulatory approvals. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our\ncompetitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users,\ndevelopers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired businesses successfully or\neffectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to successfully integrate our\nacquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our company, the results of\noperations of the combined company could be adversely affected. The process of acquiring a business, including any\nintegration efforts, requires significant time and resources, requires significant attention from management, and\ncan disrupt the ordinary functioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully,\nwhich could harm our business. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and\naccurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in usage of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our business, and we\nhave a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for\nand model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our\nfuture performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could continue to slow or our revenue could\ndecline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform; increased competition;\ncontraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for\ncapacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities or to adapt and respond\nto inflationary factors affecting our business or future economic recession. The changes the COVID-19 pandemic\nfostered on the way companies operate, including the shifts to remote and hybrid work have limited our ability to\nforecast revenue, costs, and expenses due to the uncertainty around how companies choose to operate in the future,\nincluding the impacts of a remote and hybrid workplace. We have encountered and will encounter risks and\nuncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and\nuncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe rely on data from tools to calculate certain of our key business metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such\nmetrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track our key business metrics with tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our tools have\nlimitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our performance metrics, including the key metrics we report. If the tools we use to track\nthese metrics over- or undercount performance or contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate and our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business may be distorted, which could affect our longer-term strategies.\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure our key business metrics, and regularly review our\nprocesses to assess potential improvements.\n32\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nlaws and regulations, industry standards, policies, and contractual obligations relating to privacy, data\nprotection, information security, and other matters could harm, and has in the past harmed, our reputation and\nbusiness and subject us to significant fines and liability.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make\naccessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information,\nincluding personal information, customer and user content, business data, trade secrets, intellectual property,\nthird-party data, business plans, transactions, and financial information. Our data processing activities subject\nus to numerous privacy, data protection, and information security obligations, such as various laws, regulations,\nguidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, and contractual requirements.\nLaws in the United States\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal information privacy laws, consumer\nprotection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping\nlaws). Numerous U.S. states have enacted comprehensive privacy laws that impose certain obligations on covered\nbusinesses, including providing specific disclosures in privacy notices and affording residents with certain rights\nconcerning their personal data. As applicable, such rights may include the right to access, correct, or delete\ncertain personal data, and to opt-out of certain data processing activities, such as targeted advertising,\nprofiling, and automated decision-making. The exercise of these rights may impact our business and ability to\nprovide our products and services. Certain states also impose stricter requirements for processing certain personal\ndata, including sensitive information, such as conducting data privacy impact assessments. These state laws allow\nfor statutory fines for noncompliance. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) applies to\npersonal information of consumers, business representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide\nspecific disclosures in privacy notices and honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy\nrights. The CCPA provides for fines and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover\nsignificant statutory damages. Similar laws are being considered in several other states, as well as at the federal\nand local levels and we expect more states to pass similar laws in the future. These developments may further\ncomplicate compliance efforts and increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom\nwe rely. Under various laws and other obligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, we\nare required to obtain certain consents to process personal information. For example, some of our data processing\npractices may be challenged under wiretapping laws when we obtain consumer information from third parties through\nvarious methods, including chatbot and session replay providers, or via third-party marketing pixels. These\npractices are subject to increased challenges by class action plaintiffs. Several states and foreign jurisdictions\nhave enacted statutes imposing obligations on businesses collecting or processing biometric information. For\nexample, Illinois’ Biometric Information Privacy Act (“BIPA”) regulates the collection, use, safeguarding, and\nstorage of biometric information and provides for substantial penalties and statutory damages. The Federal Trade\nCommission (“FTC”), has indicated that use of biometric technologies (including facial recognition technologies)\nmay be subject to additional scrutiny. Our inability or failure to obtain consent for these practices could result\nin adverse consequences, including class action litigation, mass arbitration demands, and regulatory attention.\nLaws Outside of the United States\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards related to privacy,\ndata protection, and information security may govern. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (“EU GDPR”), the United Kingdom’s GDPR (“UK GDPR”), Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de\nProteção de Dados Pessoais, or “LGPD”) (Law No. 13,709/2018), and China’s Personal Information Protection Law\n(“PIPL”) impose strict requirements for processing personal information. For example, under the EU GDPR, companies\nmay face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million\nEuros under the EU GDPR and 17.5 million pounds sterling under the UK GDPR, or 4% of annual global revenue, in each\ncase, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal information brought by classes\nof data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent their interests. China’s PIPL\nimposes a set of specific obligations on covered businesses in connection with their processing and transfer of\npersonal information and imposes fines of up to RMB 50 million or 5% of the prior year’s total annual revenue of\nthe violator. The Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (“FADP”), also applies to the collection and processing of\npersonal information, including health-related information, by companies located in Switzerland, or in certain\ncircumstances, by companies located outside of Switzerland.\nWe also market to customers in Asia and have operations in Japan, Singapore and India, and may be subject to new\nand emerging privacy, data protection, and information security regimes in the region, including Japan’s Act on the\nProtection of\n33\nTable of Contents\nPersonal Information, Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act, and India's new privacy legislation, the Digital\nPersonal Data Protection Act.\nIn addition, we may be unable to transfer personal information from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United\nStates or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe\nand other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal\ninformation to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”)\nhave significantly restricted the transfer of personal information to the United States and other countries whose\nprivacy laws they generally believe are inadequate. Other jurisdictions have in the past and may continue to adopt\nsimilarly stringent data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various\nmechanisms that may be used to transfer personal information from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance\nwith law, such as the EEA’s standard contractual clause, and the EU-U.S. Data Privacy Framework and the UK\nextension thereto (which allow for transfers to relevant U.S.-based organizations who self-certify compliance and\nparticipate in the Framework), these mechanisms can be subject to legal challenges, and there is no assurance that\nwe can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal information to the United States.\nIf there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal information from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions\nto the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face\nsignificant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate\npart of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense,\nincreased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work\nwith partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal\ninformation necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal information out of\nthe EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from\nregulators, individual litigants, and activist groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to\nsuspend or permanently cease certain transfers of personal information out of Europe for allegedly violating the EU\nGDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations. For example, in May 2023, the Irish Data Protection Commission\ndetermined that a major social media company’s use of the standard contractual clauses to transfer personal\ninformation from Europe to the United States was insufficient and levied a 1.2 billion Euro fine against the\ncompany and prohibited the company from transferring personal information to the United States. The United States\nis also increasingly scrutinizing certain data transfers and may also impose certain data localization\nrequirements.\nWe may also become subject to new laws that regulate non-personal information. For example, the European Union’s\nData Act imposes certain data and cloud service interoperability and switching obligations to enable users to\nswitch between cloud service providers without undue delay or cost, as well as certain requirements concerning\ncross-border international transfers of, and governmental access to, non-personal information outside the EEA.\nDepending on how this Act and any similar laws are implemented and interpreted, we may have to adapt our business\npractices, contractual arrangements, and products and services to comply with such obligations.\nArtificial Intelligence\nOur development and use of AI technologies is subject to privacy, data protection, IP, and information security\nlaws, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, and contractual requirements, as\nwell as increasing regulation and scrutiny. Several jurisdictions around the globe, including the EU, the UK and\ncertain U.S. states, have proposed, enacted, or are considering laws governing the development and use of\ntechnology featuring AI. For example, the EU's AI Act enters in phases this year and will have a direct effect\nacross all EU jurisdictions. The EU AI Act and other similar laws, if implemented and if applicable, could impose\nonerous obligations related to the use of AI-related systems. Obligations on AI may make it harder for us to\nconduct our business using, or build products incorporating, AI, require us to change our business practices,\nrequire us to retrain our algorithms, require us to disclose or provide greater transparency regarding the nature\nof our AI tools and the data we have employed to train them, or prevent or limit our use of AI. For example, the\nFTC has required other companies to turn over (or disgorge) valuable insights or trainings generated through the\nuse of AI where they allege the company has violated privacy and consumer protection laws. Additionally, certain\nprivacy laws extend rights to consumers (such as the right to delete certain personal information) and regulate\nautomated decision making, which may be incompatible with our use of AI. If we do not develop or incorporate AI in\na manner consistent with these factors, and consistent with customer expectations, it has in the past and may in\nthe future result in an adverse impact to our reputation, our business may be less efficient, or we may be at a\ncompetitive disadvantage. Similarly, if customers and users do not widely adopt our new product AI experiences,\nfeatures, and capabilities, or they do not perform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our\ninvestment.\nLaws Relating to Minors\nAdditionally, regulators are increasingly scrutinizing companies that process minors' data and/or provide online\nservices or other interactive platforms used by minors. Numerous laws, regulations, and legally-binding codes, such\nas the Children’s\n34\nTable of Contents\nOnline Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), California’s Age Appropriate Design Code, the CCPA, other U.S. state\ncomprehensive privacy laws, the EU and UK GDPR, the EU's Digital Services Act (\"DSA\"), the UK's Online Safety Act\n(\"OSA\") and the UK Age Appropriate Design Code, impose various obligations on companies that process minors' data\nand/or provide online services, or other interactive platforms used by children, including prohibiting showing\nminors advertising, requiring age verification, limiting the use of minors’ personal information, requiring certain\nconsents to process such data and extending certain rights to children and their parents with respect to that data.\nThese laws may, and in some cases already have been subject to legal challenges and changing interpretations which\nmay further complicate our efforts to comply with laws applicable to us. Some of these obligations have wide\nranging applications, including for services that do not intentionally target child users (defined in some\ncircumstances as a user under the age of 18 years old). In particular, COPPA is a U.S. Federal law that applies to\noperators of commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect\npersonal information from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they\nare collecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications and\ncollaboration services to schools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid\nclassrooms, distance learning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these\nservices, Zoom may be used by students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect personal information\nfrom such students on behalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually consent to Zoom’s\ninformation practices on behalf of students, prior to students using the services. If we fail to accurately\nanticipate the application, interpretation, or legislative expansion of these laws, regulations, and legally-\nbinding codes, we could be subject to governmental enforcement actions, data processing restrictions, litigation,\nfines and penalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as a result of any such failures, we could\nbe in breach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could lose trust in us, which could harm our\nreputation and business.\nConsumer Preferences and Protection\nIndividuals are increasingly resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of personal information to deliver\ntargeted advertising. Third-party platforms have introduced (or plan to introduce) measures to provide users with\nmore privacy controls over targeted advertising activities, and regulators (including in the EEA/UK) are heavily\nscrutinizing the use of technologies used to deliver such advertisements. Major technology platforms on which we\nrely to gather information about consumers have adopted or proposed measures to provide consumers with additional\ncontrol over the collection, use, and sharing of their personal information for targeted advertising or other\npurposes. For example, in 2021, Apple began allowing users to more easily opt-out of activity tracking across\ndevices. In February 2022, Google announced similar plans to adopt additional privacy controls on its Android\ndevices to allow users to limit sharing of their data with third parties and reduce cross-device tracking for\nadvertising purposes. Additionally, Google has announced that it intends to phase out third-party cookies in its\nChrome browser, which could make it more difficult for us to target advertisements. Other browsers, such as Firefox\nand Safari, have already adopted similar measures. In addition, legislative proposals and present laws and\nregulations regulate the use of cookies and other tracking technologies, electronic communications, and marketing.\nFor example, in the EEA and the UK, regulators are increasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to\nthe targeted advertising ecosystem. European regulators have issued significant fines in certain circumstances\nwhere the regulators alleged that appropriate consent was not obtained in connection with targeted advertising\nactivities. In the EU, it is anticipated that the ePrivacy Regulation and national implementing laws will replace\nthe current national laws implementing the ePrivacy Directive, which may require us to make significant operational\nchanges. In the United States, the CCPA, for example, grants California residents the right to opt-out of a\ncompany’s sharing of personal information for advertising purposes in exchange for money or other valuable\nconsideration, and requires covered businesses to honor user-enabled browser signals from the Global Privacy\nControl. Partially as a result of these developments, individuals are becoming increasingly resistant to the\ncollection, use, and sharing of personal information to deliver targeted advertising or other types of tracking.\nIndividuals are now more aware of options related to consent, “do not track” mechanisms (such as browser signals\nfrom the Global Privacy Control), and “ad-blocking” software to prevent the collection of their personal\ninformation for targeted advertising purposes. As a result, we may be required to change the way we market our\nproducts, and any of these developments or changes could materially impair our ability to reach new or existing\ncustomers or otherwise negatively affect our operations.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers. For example, in September 2024, the FCC adopted new rules scheduled to take effect in 2027 that\nrequire video conferencing services to include features that expand accessibility requirements for consumers of our\nproducts and services. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future\nbecome the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,\nincluding our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or\napplied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur\nfines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\nIndustry Standards\n35\nTable of Contents\nIn addition to privacy, data protection and information security laws, we are contractually subject to certain\nindustry standards adopted by industry groups and may become subject to additional such obligations in the future.\nWe also have certain privacy, data protection, information security obligations arising from the practices in our\nindustry or of companies similar to us. We are also bound by other contractual obligations related to privacy, data\nprotection, and information security, and our efforts to comply with such obligations may not be successful. If we\nfall below such industry standard or cannot comply with such contractual obligations, our reputation and business\nmay be harmed. We also publish privacy policies, marketing materials, whitepapers and other statements, such as\ncompliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding privacy, data protection,\nartificial intelligence and information security. Regulators in the United States have scrutinized and are\nincreasingly scrutinizing these statements, and if these policies, materials or statements are found to be\ndeficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, misleading or misrepresentative of our practices, we may be\nsubject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences.\nGovernment Inquiries and Investigations\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nIn June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nEDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign political\nparties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user data, the\ndevelopment and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took responding to law enforcement\nrequests from the Chinese government. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various\nsecurity, data protection, and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as\nwell as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks\ninformation relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any\nattempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as\nthey relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking\nrelated information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations and have conducted our own thorough\ninternal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters\ncould cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational\nharm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business. As\nof the date hereof, in regard to the SEC matter, a tentative settlement of $18.0 million is now outstanding and\nremains subject to SEC approval. We do not know when these matters will be completed, including the SEC matter,\nwhich facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or\nmay not take.\nWe were also the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations and\npractices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January 19,\n2021. We could fail or be perceived to fail to comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other\norders or settlements relating to litigation or governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and\nsecurity practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such orders or settlements may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens\nimposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other obligations that are applicable to the businesses of our\nusers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business.\nConsents\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our\n36\nTable of Contents\nservices and features, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability\nto store and process user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nPublic Perception\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand has led to greater public scrutiny\nof, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage, disclosure, and processing of\npersonal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and customers, particularly those\nthat are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their own IT controls like those of\na larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with control over user settings. This\nhas resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by malicious actors. Additional\nunfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and litigation\nexposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence, additional\nexpenses and other harm to our business.\nFailure to Comply with our Obligations\nObligations related to privacy, data protection, information security, the use of AI, the provision of online\nservices and other interactive platforms (and consumers' expectations regarding them) are quickly changing,\nbecoming increasingly stringent, and creating uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to\ndiffering applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing\nfor and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources and has and may continue to\nnecessitate changes to our services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third\nparties that process personal information on our behalf.\nWe may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our obligations relating to\nprivacy, data protection, information security, the use of AI and the provision of online services and other\ninteractive platforms. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties with whom we work may fail to\ncomply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third parties\nwith whom we work fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable privacy, data\nprotection, and information security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited\nto: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar);\nlitigation (including class-action claims) and mass arbitration demands; additional reporting requirements and/or\noversight; bans or restrictions on processing personal information; and orders to destroy or not use personal\ninformation. In particular, plaintiffs have become increasingly more active in bringing privacy-related claims\nagainst companies, including class claims and mass arbitration demands. Some of these claims allow for the recovery\nof statutory damages on a per violation basis, and, if viable, carry the potential for monumental statutory\ndamages, depending on the volume of data and the number of violations. Any of these events could have a material\nadverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of\ncustomers; inability to process personal information or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to\ndevelop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse\npublicity; or substantial changes to our business model or operations.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments have taken and may in the future take administrative, legislative, or regulatory\naction, including imposing tariffs, that could materially interfere with our ability to sell products in certain\ncountries. The direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure\nand are only one part of a larger U.S./China economic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are\nuncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or\nworsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the United States\nand its trading partners, especially China, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to\nglobal trade, including retaliatory trade restrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot\npredict what actions may ultimately be taken by the current administration or future administrations with respect\nto tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or other countries, what products may be subject\nto such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. Any further deterioration in\nthe relations between the United States and China could exacerbate these actions and other governmental\nintervention. For example, the implementation of China’s national-security law in Hong Kong has created additional\nU.S.-China tensions and could potentially increase the risks associated with the business and operations of\nU.S.-based technology companies in China. Any alterations to our business strategy or operations made in order to\nadapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-consuming and expensive, and certain of our competitors may\nbe better suited to withstand or react to these changes.\nFurther, the U.S. Government has expressed concerns with the security of information and communications technology\nand services (“ICTS”) sourced from providers in China, Russia, and other jurisdictions. In May 2019, an executive\norder was issued invoking national emergency economic powers to implement a framework to regulate the acquisition\nor transfer of ICTS in transactions that imposed undue national security risks. The executive order is subject to\nimplementation by the Secretary of\n37\nTable of Contents\nCommerce and applies to contracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. On March 22, 2021, the\nU.S. Department of Commerce issued an interim final rule allowing it to identify, review, and prohibit ICTS\ntransactions that pose a national security risk, including transactions involving specified countries, such as\nChina. Several aspects of this rule remain unclear including the scope of affected transactions and how the rule\nwill be implemented and enforced in practice. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional\nrestrictions and may implement further restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese\ncompanies. Due to the uncertainty regarding the timing, content, and extent of any such changes in policy, we\ncannot assure you that we will successfully mitigate any negative impact. Depending upon their duration and\nimplementation, these tariffs, the executive order and its implementation, and other regulatory actions could\nmaterially affect our business, including in the form of increased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased\npricing for customers, and reduced sales.\nWe may be subject to additional liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. State and local taxing authorities have differing rules and regulations that are subject\nto varying interpretations. This makes the applicability of sales tax to e-commerce businesses, such as ours,\nuncertain and complex. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, additional taxes,\nfees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical presence\nor “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales of our\nplatform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus for\nsales made over the Internet and, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, states may\nrequire an e-commerce business with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax. Therefore, it\nis possible that we could face future audits or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities and that our\nliability for these taxes could exceed our estimates. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in\nthe U.S. or internationally, could harm our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our customers’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in potential violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we have in the past\ninadvertently made and may inadvertently make our software products available to some customers in potential\nviolation of the EAR. Therefore, as warranted, we may submit voluntary self-disclosures regarding compliance with\nU.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of\nIndustry and Security (“BIS”). For instance, in March 2022, we submitted a voluntary self-disclosure to BIS\nregarding our compliance with certain U.S. export control laws and regulations, which BIS closed out with a warning\nletter with no referral for criminal or administrative prosecution, and no imposition of monetary fines or\npenalties.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result\nin fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, business disruption,\nreputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working to implement additional\ncontrols designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully\neffective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or\nin our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international\noperations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nlikely harm our business.\n38\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to, or respond to requests from law enforcement in connection with enforcement of, a variety of\nU.S. and international laws that could result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our\nbusiness due to changes in the laws, changes in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws,\nor investigations into compliance with the laws.\nWe may be subject to, or respond to requests from law enforcement that are legally valid, appropriately scoped, and\nsufficiently detailed in connection with enforcement of, various civil and criminal laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive, and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to protect user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent, or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. Our trust and safety team may take further action as appropriate,\nincluding suspension or termination of the participant's account or referral to law enforcement. The laws in this\narea are currently in a state of flux and vary widely between jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that\nin the future we and our competitors may be subject to legal actions along with the users who shared such content.\nIn addition, regardless of any legal liability we may face, our reputation could be harmed should there be an\nincident generating extensive negative publicity about the content shared on our platform. Such publicity would\nharm our business.\nChanges in law or policy could compel us or limit our ability to engage in content moderation, or otherwise limit\nthe ability of users to engage in inappropriate or harmful behavior, and could expose us to liability.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. Section 230 provides\nprotection for providers of online service from liability for content produced by third parties and protects the\nright to engage in moderation of user content. The current administration and many members of Congress from both\nparties support the reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of Congressional action remains. In\naddition, the FCC is considering a petition to adopt rules interpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of\ninternet platforms for third-party content that is transmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of\noffensive content. No date has been set for a vote on that proposal, and the FCC has not released any document\ndescribing the rules that would be proposed. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition. If\nCongress revises or repeals Section 230 or the FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same level of\nprotection offered by Section 230. In addition, there are pending cases before the judiciary that may result in\nchanges to the protections afforded to internet platforms, including a lawsuit that, if successful, would greatly\nlimit the scope of Section 230. The U.S. Supreme Court recently declined to limit the applicability of Section 230\nin certain circumstances, but future cases may not yield the same results and a recent decision by the U.S. Court\nof Appeals for the Third Circuit would limit the applicability of Section 230 to curated content. These various\nefforts to limit the protections provided by Section 230 would increase the risks faced by internet-based\nbusinesses, like Zoom, that rely on third-party content. Even if claims asserted against us do not result in\nliability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If we are found liable for\nour customers’ or other users’ activities, we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business\nmethods, or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nLegislation has been adopted in Florida and Texas that is intended to reduce or eliminate the power of businesses\noperating on the Internet to moderate user-generated content, implicitly eliminating the federal protections\ngranted under Section 230. Similar legislation has been introduced in other states. Implementation of the Florida\nand Texas statutes has been stayed by various federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 18, 2022,\nthe parties in the Florida case requested, and were granted, a stay of the appeals court mandate pending Supreme\nCourt review. On September 16, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision upholding\nthe Texas law. On September 30, the parties in that case filed an unopposed motion to stay the Fifth Circuit\ndecision pending Supreme Court review, and the Fifth Circuit granted that request on October 13, 2022. On September\n29, 2023, the Supreme Court announced that it would review both the Florida and Texas decisions, and on July 1,\n2024, the Court issued a decision returning both cases to the trial courts for additional analysis. The district\ncourt in Texas, on August 29, 2024, issued a decision staying some portions of the Texas law and allowing others to\ngo into effect, relying on analysis under both Section 230 and the First Amendment, and on November 18, 2024, the\nFifth Circuit issued an order setting parameters for the district court's consideration of the issues raised by the\nSupreme Court. The district court in Florida set a trial date in its case for June 2025. Florida amended its\nstatute in an effort to address issues that led the court to issue the stay. It is likely that any other such state\nlegislation also would be challenged under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and on the ground that it\nis preempted by Section 230. In addition, on August 27, 2024, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit\nissued a decision limiting the protections afforded by Section 230 in cases where a social media company curates\nuser feeds to the extent that the feed becomes the speech of the company, reversing a trial court decision that\n39\nTable of Contents\nimmunized the company under Section 230. We cannot predict whether any such state legislation will be adopted,\nenforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.\nFurthermore, new laws and regulations have been enacted or are being considered that impose extensive obligations\nregarding online safety and the operation of online services or platforms, such as the OSA and DSA, which may\nincrease our compliance costs, require changes to our processes, operations, and business practices. For example,\nthese new laws and regulations may seek to regulate the sharing of user‑generated content and require us to\nidentify, mitigate, and manage the risks of harm to users from illegal or harmful content. Violating these\nobligations could carry significant consequences. For example, violating the DSA can result in fines of up to 6% of\ntotal annual worldwide revenue and violating the OSA can result in audits, inspections, and fines of up to £18\nmillion or 10% of worldwide revenue, whichever is higher.\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) service provider. As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access. The Supreme Court currently is considering a challenge to the USF contribution rules that could\naffect how such contributions are collected from services providers like us. Congress or the FCC may expand the\nscope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time. In addition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common\ncarrier or telecommunications service could result in additional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do\nnot comply with any current or future state regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could ultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any\nenforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public process, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly\nimpair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers and harm our business.\nAs described above, the FCC has reinstated its prior network neutrality regulations, but the FCC order was reversed\nby the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. See Part 1A. Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with\nbroadband access could cause current or potential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly\nleading our customers to switch to our competitors, or to cancel their subscriptions to our platform. Changes in\nFCC regulation of the internet and internet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations on our\nother services. Such action could result in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications\nservices like the ones we offer. The imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could\nbe required to modify our service offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such\nregulation could result in substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.\nOn December 13, 2023, the FCC adopted revised rules on reporting of breaches of private customer information, known\nas CPNI. The revised rules could broaden the types of CPNI breaches that must be reported, but also could limit the\nnumber of reports that must be filed by adopting a minimum threshold for the number of customers affected and not\nrequiring reporting in certain circumstances when customers are not harmed. The rules also require that breach\nreports be provided directly to the FCC, which could increase the risk of enforcement action, including fines and\nbehavioral remedies. These rules are not yet in effect and have been challenged in federal court. We cannot predict\nthe impact of the new rules on our operations or business or whether they will be overturned in court.\nThe FCC has adopted rules that prohibit Chinese companies that are deemed to be a national security risk by other\nfederal agencies from obtaining new authorizations and placed on a list known as the Covered List to sell\ntelecommunications equipment in the U.S. and is considering proposed rules that would ban those companies from\nselling previously-authorized equipment or could prohibit the use of their equipment in the U.S. Zoom does not\ncurrently have any equipment from the companies subject to the ban in its network, but if other companies are added\nto the Covered List and the FCC adopts rules that ban sales or use of equipment from such companies, we could be\nrequired to find new sources for similar equipment or replace existing equipment entirely.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer. The California Public Utilities Commission has adopted an order\nrequiring VoIP providers like Zoom Phone\n40\nTable of Contents\nto obtain authority to operate in that state. We generally pass USF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to\nour customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in our products becoming more expensive. We expect\nthat state public utility commissions will continue their attempts to apply state telecommunications regulations to\nservices like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or future state regulations that apply to our\nbusiness, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, and we may have to restructure our product\nofferings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nCertain states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the\nconduct of broadband providers. California’s state-specific network neutrality law has taken effect and Vermont’s\nlaw took effect, but a challenge to that law remains pending. The FCC’s April 25 order permits it to preempt any\nstate-level network neutrality requirements that go beyond the requirements adopted in that order, but specifically\nheld that the California law would not be preempted. The FCC order was stayed on August 1, 2024, pending resolution\nof an appeal. For additional information on this order, see the risk factor titled “Failures in internet\ninfrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to believe that our\nsystems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers to switch to our competitors, or to cancel their\nsubscriptions to our platform.” We cannot predict whether other state initiatives will be enforced, modified,\noverturned, or vacated.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. Some companies, including some of our\ncompetitors, own large numbers of patents, as well as valuable copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to\nassert claims against us. As we face increasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility\nof intellectual property rights claims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the\npast been, are currently, and may from time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes\nrelated to our use of intellectual property, our business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend\nthese lawsuits vigorously and believe that we have valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and\ntime consuming, divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade\npotential customers from subscribing to our services, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to\nthese lawsuits, there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle\nlitigation and disputes on terms that are unfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that\nmay not be reversible upon appeal. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of\nour operations or pay substantial amounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger\ncustomers include certain provisions for indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third\nparty’s intellectual property rights, which could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course\nof any litigation or dispute, we may make announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other\ninterim developments. If securities analysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price\nof our Class A common stock may decline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to\nseek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on\nreasonable terms and may significantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may\nnot be available to us at all, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices\nor discontinue the practices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require\nsignificant effort and expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, trademark and domain name protection,\ntrademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, consultants,\nand third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make business decisions about\nwhen to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright or trade secret\nprotection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where we seek patent\nprotection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of\nour products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our\n41\nTable of Contents\ntrademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If\nwe do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that\nwe have developed in those trademarks could be lost, diminished or impaired, which could harm our brand and our\nbusiness. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our intellectual property or proprietary rights;\nthird parties may challenge our intellectual property or proprietary rights; our pending and future patent,\ntrademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; and we may not be able to prevent infringement without\nincurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary\ntechnologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part\non trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties. These\nagreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate\nremedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may develop similar\ntechnologies or processes, or independently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to\nassert our trade secret rights. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of\nintellectual property protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as rights to patents,\ncopyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. For instance, the\nlegal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of\npatents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in\nprotecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may also be\nexposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other\nintellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive\ninformation. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to\nobtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming\nlitigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of\nour proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform,\nbrand, and other intangible assets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our\nplatform and its features. Any of these events would harm our business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software (including our open\nsource AI models) in our technologies. Open source software is generally licensed by its authors or other third\nparties under open source licenses. From time to time, companies that use third-party open source software have\nfaced claims challenging the use of such open source software and requesting compliance with the open source\nsoftware license terms. Accordingly, we may be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to\nbe open source software or claiming non-compliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open\nsource software licenses require end-users who use, distribute or make available across a network software and\nservices that include open source software to offer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source\nsoftware for no cost. We may also be required to make publicly available source code (which in some circumstances\ncould include valuable proprietary code) for modifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating\nor using the open source software and/or to license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the\nparticular open source license. Additionally, if a third-party software provider has incorporated open source\nsoftware into software that we license from such provider, we could be required to disclose our source code that\nincorporates or is a modification of such licensed software. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and\ncomply with the licenses of third-party open source software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we\nmay inadvertently use third-party open source software in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with\nthe terms of their licenses, including claims of intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of\ncontract. Furthermore, there exists today an increasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost\nnone of which have been tested in courts of law to provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we\nwere to receive a claim of non-compliance with the terms of any of these open source licenses, we could be required\nto publicly release certain portions of our proprietary source code. We could also be required to expend\nsubstantial time and resources to re-engineer some of our software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our\nbusiness. Furthermore, with respect to our use of third party open source AI models, some licenses to third party\nopen source AI models contain additional use restrictions pertaining to research-only limitations or, in some\ncases, vague notions of responsible uses for the AI models, which may not in all instances comport with our\nbusiness practices.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\n42\nTable of Contents\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These fluctuations could\ncause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations\nin the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral political, social, economic and market conditions, in both domestic and our foreign markets, including\neffects of increased interest rates and inflationary pressures.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April 2020, June 2020, July 2020 and October 2021, we and certain of our officers and\ndirectors were sued in putative class action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging\nviolations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our\ndata privacy and security measures. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert\nour management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. We may be the\ntarget of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\n43\nTable of Contents\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January\n31, 2025, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 61.8% of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding\n57.0% of such voting power in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2025, our founder, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Eric S. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 7.2% of our outstanding capital stock but\ncontrolled approximately 31.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have\nsignificant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\nincluding election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Zoom or\nour assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one\nshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or\nincapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing\nservices to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of\nthe then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary\nof the closing of our IPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate\nmatters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\n44\nTable of Contents\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\n45\nTable of Contents\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock\nafter price appreciation as the only way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications and collaboration platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using\nlegacy communication methods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product\nfeature that every customer or user wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform\ndoes not provide. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over\ntime, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market\nopportunity estimates will purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even\nif the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow\nfor a variety of reasons outside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks\nmaterializes, it could harm our business and prospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health\ndevelopments could have an adverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could\ninclude business and service disruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our\nemployees' ability to travel to support our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested\ncapital. Significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nWe have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies. The financial success of our\ninvestments in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. In\naddition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market\ndata. Likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an\nexit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public\nofferings and acquisitions are currently depressed and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the\ncompanies we have invested in could significantly worsen. In addition, valuations of privately held companies are\ninherently complex due to the lack of readily available market data.\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held non-marketable securities through\nthe consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of\noperations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held securities and the valuation and\ntiming of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. Our ability to\nmitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for\na set period of time. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment\ncapital. Changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies\ncould be material to our financial statements and negatively impact our business and financial results.\n46\nTable of Contents\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all, particularly during times of market volatility and\ngeneral economic instability. The need for additional liquidity may also be affected by the federal government’s\npotential failure to raise the debt ceiling or correct a prolonged banking or financial crisis. If we raise\nadditional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have\nrights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our Class A common stock, and our stockholders may\nexperience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to\nexpend, significant resources in our accounting, legal and IT organizations.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic\nmanagement evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in\nour periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Recently, the SEC has alleged violations of internal controls\nat other public companies, even in the absence of an underlying accounting or disclosure\n47\nTable of Contents\nviolation, which significantly increases the enforcement risk faced by us and other public companies for any\nweaknesses in disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting.\nIneffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause\ninvestors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative\neffect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these\nrequirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We are required to provide an annual\nmanagement report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.\nRegulators', investors’ and other stakeholders’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social\nand governance factors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, customers and other stakeholders concerning environmental,\nsocial and governance matters. To the extent we share information about our practices in this area, we could be\ncriticized for the accuracy, adequacy, or completeness of such disclosures. In addition, we may communicate related\ngoals or initiatives from time to time, which can be costly to achieve and difficult to implement. There is no\nassurance that we will achieve any of these goals, that our initiatives will achieve their intended outcome, and\nour ability to implement these initiatives or achieve these goals may be dependent on external factors outside our\ncontrol. Further, we may experience backlash from customers, government entities, advocacy groups, employees, or\nother stakeholders who disagree with our actual or perceived positions, or with our lack of position on social,\nenvironmental, governance, political, public policy, economic, geopolitical, or other sensitive issues. Any\nperceived lack of transparency about these matters could harm our brand and reputation, our employees’ engagement\nand retention, and the willingness of our customers and partners to do business with us.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nThere are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. We have a global workforce, and operate in\nleased office spaces and data centers, and the short, medium and long term climate impacts to our business are\nunclear.\n48\nTable of Contents\nChanging market dynamics, global policy developments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather\nevents to infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our\nthird-party suppliers and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs\nto maintain or resume operations. In addition, we may be subject to increased regulations, reporting requirements,\nstandards or expectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business.",

CYBERSECURITY\nRisk Management and Strategy\nWe have designed and implemented an information security program that is tailored to our operations and\ninfrastructure, the nature of our products and services, and the sensitivity of data. Our information security\nprogram consists of processes that are designed to identify, assess, and manage material risks from cybersecurity\nthreats.\nWe have implemented cybersecurity risk management processes that include, for example, vulnerability assessments,\napplication security assessments, penetration testing, third party security assessments, security audits, and\nongoing risk assessments.In addition, we have implemented certain technical, physical, and organizational\nsafeguards designed to mitigate material risks from cybersecurity threats, including, for example, depending on the\nenvironment or system: information security policies and standards, data protection policies and standards,\nsecurity training and awareness campaigns, information protection processes, and systems monitoring for\ncybersecurity threats. We have also implemented an Incident Response Plan and procedures that provide us with a\nframework for responding to cybersecurity incidents. The Incident Response Plan and procedures provide protocols\nfor incident evaluation, including the use of third-party service providers, processes for notification, and\ninternal escalation of information to our senior management and the appropriate Board committee(s), all as\nappropriate depending on the nature of the incident. The Incident Response Plan is reviewed and updated, as\nnecessary, under the leadership of Zoom’s Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”).\nFurther, our assessment and management of material risks from cybersecurity threats are an important element of our\noverall enterprise risk management program and included in our annual enterprise risk assessment which we provide\nto senior management and the Board.\nWe use third-party service providers to assist us from time to time to identify, assess, and manage material risks\nfrom cybersecurity threats, including for example: professional services firms (including legal counsel), threat\nintelligence service providers, cybersecurity consultants, cybersecurity software and managed service providers,\npenetration testing firms, and forensic investigators.\nWe have a third party risk management program designed to oversee, identify, and mitigate material risks from\ncybersecurity threats associated with our use of third-party service providers. We perform risk-based due diligence\nand ongoing monitoring of third parties, which may include, for example: reviewing the third party’s relevant\nsecurity audits and assessments, conducting our own security assessments, and imposing contractual obligations\nrelated to information security.\nAs of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we do not believe any risks from cybersecurity threats have\nmaterially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect us, including our business strategy, results of\noperations or financial condition.For a description of the risks from cybersecurity threats that may materially\naffect us and how they may do so, see the risk factor titled \"Our security measures, and those of the third parties\nwith whom we work, have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security measures\nare compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation, expose us to\nsignificant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products and services\nmay be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and users curtailing or ceasing their\nuse of our products, us incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed\" in Part I, Item 1A. Risk\nFactors of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGovernance\nOur Board addresses our cybersecurity risk management as part of its general oversight function. As outlined in its\ncommittee charter, the Cybersecurity Risk Management Committee of the Board (“Cybersecurity Risk Committee”)\nassists the Board in fulfilling its oversight responsibility. Our CISO, Michael Adams, leads the team responsible\nfor implementing and maintaining our information security program and reports directly to the Chief Operating\nOfficer (“COO”), who reports directly to our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”). Mr. Adams is a graduate of the United\nStates Naval Academy and brings nearly 30 years of security and leadership experience, including serving as Deputy\nGeneral Counsel of NATO's International Security Assistance Force Joint Command, Deputy General Counsel of the\nUnited States' Military's Pacific Command, and Deputy\n49\nTable of Contents\nGeneral Counsel for two Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States, as well as an executive at a\nleading technology company. Mr. Adams previously served as Zoom's Chief Counsel to the COO and CISO.\nThe CISO provides regular briefings to our senior management and the Cybersecurity Risk Committee concerning\nrelevant cybersecurity risks and the processes we have implemented to address them. The Cybersecurity Risk\nCommittee and the Board also receive various reports, summaries, and presentations related to cybersecurity\nthreats, risks, and mitigations.",

Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held in street name by brokers and\nother nominees on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our\nClass A common stock represented by these holders of record.\nDividend Policy\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nZoom Workplace with AI Companion is an open, AI-first work platform for human connection. Our platform is designed\nto enable seamless communication and collaboration through a suite of products that includes Zoom Meetings, Zoom\nPhone, Zoom Team Chat, and Zoom Docs, and more, all powered by AI to improve productivity, collaboration, and\nbusiness outcomes.\nWe strive to simplify the workday with tools that drive meaningful team collaboration and customer engagement. Zoom\nWorkplace, our AI-driven platform, supports businesses by providing an open, scalable solution for communication\nand collaboration. This includes Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Revenue Accelerator, and Zoom Events, which empower\nsales, marketing, and customer experience teams to foster stronger customer relationships.\nAI is core to Zoom’s product innovation. In fiscal year 2025, Zoom continued to invest in AI and focused on three\nkey areas regarding AI: supporting individual productivity, powering better collaboration, and helping customer-\nfacing teams deliver meaningful business value and delight to their customers. Our federated approach to AI enables\nusers to leverage multiple AI models (including those from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta), making AI more accessible\nand affordable so that more people can incorporate them in their day-to-day workflows. In line with our commitment\nto responsible AI, Zoom does not use customer audio, video, chat, screen sharing, attachments, or other\ncommunications (such as poll results, whiteboard, and reactions) to train Zoom’s or third-party AI models.\nZoom’s platform prioritizes security and privacy, with 32 co-located data centers globally and robust encryption.\nWe are committed to delivering high-quality, real-time video, even in low-bandwidth conditions, while safeguarding\nour customers' data.\nRevenue is driven by subscriptions to Zoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services. Our core offerings include Zoom\nWorkplace Pro, Business, and Enterprise bundles, with vertical-specific plans for Education, Healthcare, and\nGovernment. We also offer Zoom Phone, with regional and global calling plans designed to meet diverse customer\nneeds.\nOur revenue was $4,665.4 million, $4,527.2 million, and $4,393.0 million for the fiscal years ended January 31,\n2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 3.1% and 3.1%, respectively. We had net\nincome of $1,010.2 million, $637.5 million, and $103.7 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024,\nand 2023, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,945.3 million, $1,598.8 million, and\n$1,290.3 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nMacroeconomic Conditions and Other Factors\nThe macroeconomic environment including geopolitical conflicts, tariffs and trade tensions, inflationary pressures,\ninterest rate fluctuations, and foreign currency exchange rate volatility continues to create uncertainty in demand\nfor subscriptions to our unified communications and collaboration platform. These factors, along with responses by\ncentral banks and government policies, have placed pressure on consumer and business behavior, leading to elongated\nsales cycles and increased scrutiny of IT budgets among existing and potential customers. For the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2025, compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024, we experienced continued growth in total\nrevenue and revenue from Enterprise customers. However, several factors have impacted and may continue to impact\nour growth rate, such as higher market penetration, increased competition, and the maturation of our business,\namong others.\nWhile we have seen improvement in the macroeconomic environment in recent periods, we continue to monitor the\npotential effects of these circumstances as well as the overall global economy and geopolitical landscape on our\nbusiness and financial results, as well as the overall global economy. The implications of macroeconomic conditions\non our business, results of operations, and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain\nuncertain.\nRefer to “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussions of the\npotential impacts of the current macroeconomic conditions on our business.\n52\nTable of Contents\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers who use Zoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services. Our\noperating results and growth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we\nbelieve there is a significant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer\nadoption rates or the future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to\ninvest in sales and marketing in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented\nsales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Historically,\ncustomers have increased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across\ntheir operations. Over the past few years, macroeconomic headwinds have resulted in slower hiring and higher seat\ncount downsells from our existing Enterprise customers in key markets that has impacted the rate of expansion and\nhave caused our net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers to drop below one hundred percent. Despite the\ndecline in our rate of expansion, we believe there are still opportunities for future growth with our existing\ncustomers as we innovate our platform with additional product offerings and the use of AI. This expansion in the\nuse of our platform also provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our customers,\nsuch as Zoom Phone, Contact Center, and Workvivo. In order for us to address this opportunity and expand the use of\nour products with our existing customers, we will need to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new\nfeatures and functionality that are responsive to our customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing Enterprise customers through our net dollar expansion rate. We define\nEnterprise customers as distinct business units who have been engaged by either our direct sales team, resellers,\nor strategic partners. Revenue from Enterprise customers represented 59.0%, 57.9% and 54.8% of total revenue for\nthe fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. Our net dollar expansion rate includes the\nincrease in user adoption within our Enterprise customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven by the\nnumber of paid licenses within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our subscription\nrevenue from the same set of Enterprise customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion rate\nas of a period end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all Enterprise customers as of 12\nmonths prior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of subscription agreements from\nall customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) and multiplying\nit by 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all Enterprise customers\nfor the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers who have not provided any indication\nthat they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from these Enterprise customers as of the\ncurrent period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contractions, and attrition. We divide the\nCurrent Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For the trailing 12 months\ncalculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12 months. Our net dollar\nexpansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of penetration within our\ncustomer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our Enterprise customers. Our trailing\n12 month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers was 98%, 101%, and 115% as of January 31, 2025, 2024,\nand 2023, respectively.\nRetention of Online Customers\nIn addition to Enterprise customers, we also have a significant number of customers who subscribe to our services\ndirectly through our website (“Online customers” or “Online business”). Online customers represent a diverse\ncustomer base, ranging from individual consumers to small and medium-size businesses. We continue to focus on\nacquisition and retention of our Online customer base through various strategies to improve the features and\nfunctionalities of our products and services. Revenue from Online customers represented 41.0%, 42.1%, and 45.2% of\ntotal revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. The ability to retain\nthese Online customers will have an impact on our future revenue. The online monthly average churn for our Online\ncustomers was 2.9%, 3.1%, and 3.4% per month for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively. One of the dynamics in the Online portion of the business is the MRR contribution from customers who\nhave retained Zoom services for a certain portion of time as these customers tend to maintain their subscriptions\nand contribute meaningfully to the Online business. As of January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023 the percentage of total\nOnline MRR from Online customers with a continual term of service of at least 16 months was 75.1%, 74.2% and 72.0%\nrespectively.\nWe calculate our online average monthly churn by starting with the Online customer MRR as of the beginning of the\napplicable quarter (“Entry MRR”). We define Entry MRR as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements\nfrom all Online customers except for subscriptions that we recorded as churn in a previous quarter based on the\ncustomers' earlier\n53\nTable of Contents\nindication to us of their intention to cancel that subscription. We then determine the MRR related to customers who\ncanceled or downgraded their subscription or notified us of that intention during the applicable quarter\n(“Applicable Quarter MRR Churn”) and divide the Applicable Quarter MRR Churn by the applicable quarter Entry MRR to\narrive at the MRR churn rate for Online customers. We then divided that amount by three to calculate the Online\naverage monthly churn for the applicable quarter.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of Zoom Workplace and Zoom Business Services. For\nexample, we have introduced a number of new products and enhancements, including Zoom AI Companion, Zoom Docs, and\nongoing enhancements for Zoom Phone, Meetings, Zoom Rooms, Sessions, Webinars, Events, and Contact Center. We also\ndeliver Zoom Phone calling plans in more than 45 countries and territories as of January 31, 2025.\nWe recently announced several upcoming products, including Zoom Tasks, a custom AI Companion add-on, Zoom Workplace\nfor Frontline Workers, and Zoom Workplace for Clinicians. The custom AI Companion add-on is designed to handle\ncomplex tasks across our platform by integrating data from multiple sources, including third-party apps. Zoom\nWorkplace for Frontline Workers is an AI-powered mobile solution aimed at enhancing on-shift communications, task\nmanagement, and insights for frontline employees and their managers. Zoom Workplace for Clinicians is designed to\nautomate clinical workflows, leveraging healthcare AI to streamline clinical notes, reduce documentation overhead,\nand improve doctor-patient interactions. These products are expected to be generally available in the first half of\n2025.\nThird-party developers are also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it easier for\ncustomers and developers to extend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as more\ndevelopers and other third parties use our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will become the\nubiquitous platform for communications and collaboration. We will need to expend additional resources to continue\nintroducing new products, features, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the\nvalue of our platform with their own applications.\nAn E2EE option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings with up to 1,000\nparticipants as well as on Zoom Phone for one-on-one calls on the same Zoom account. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same\n256-bit AES-GCM encryption to encrypt real-time media in meetings during transit that supports standard Zoom\nMeetings, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the feature is designed so that the device of the meeting host, or originating\ncaller in the case of Zoom Phone, as opposed to Zoom’s servers, generates encryption keys and uses public key\ncryptography to distribute these keys to the other meeting participants or call recipient. Additionally, Zoom’s\npost-quantum E2EE is now globally available for Zoom Workplace, specifically for Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone, with\nsupport for Zoom Rooms coming soon. We believe that the launch of the new security enhancement makes Zoom the first\nUCaaS company to offer a post-quantum E2EE solution for video conferencing.\nInternational Opportunity\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from the rest of the world (APAC and EMEA) represented 28.2%, 28.7%,\nand 30.5% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively. We use\nstrategic partners and resellers to sell in certain international markets where we have limited or no direct sales\npresence. While we believe global demand for our platform will continue to increase as international market\nawareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our operations internationally will require considerable management\nattention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an\nenvironment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems,\nand commercial markets.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial\nprojections, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Enterprise Customers\nAs Zoom continues to expand and evolve, we have seen an increasing overlap between our Enterprise and Online\ncustomer categories. Over time, customers with lower MRR are expected to move from Enterprise to Online as we\noptimize our sales strategies. While these moves do not have a material impact on other key business metrics, the\nnumber of customers between these two groups has become less meaningful as a key business metric. Therefore,\nbeginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, we will no longer report the number of Enterprise customers as\na key business metric. However, we will\n54\nTable of Contents\ncontinue to provide this metric in the appendix of our investor deck through the end of fiscal year 2026, which\nwill be accessible on our investor relations website (investors.zoom.us).\nInstead of using Enterprise customer count as an indicator of our performance, we believe that revenue from\nEnterprise customers and the number of customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 month revenue are\nbetter indicators of our ability to grow and scale with larger organizations. These metrics better reflect our\nprogress in attracting and retaining high-value customers and scaling our business over time.\nAs of January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had approximately 192,600, 220,400, and 213,000 Enterprise customers,\nrespectively. During the three months ended April 30, 2024, in order to enhance customer experience and improve\nefficiency, we transitioned approximately 26,800 Enterprise customers with lower MRR away from working with direct\nsales teams, resellers, or strategic partners. These customers are now considered Online customers and no longer\nincluded in our Enterprise customer total as of January 31, 2025. The impact of this transition did not have a\nmaterial impact on the percentage of revenue from Enterprise and Online customers, net dollar expansion rate, or\nOnline average monthly churn.\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers who contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as it\nis a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from\nthese customers represented 31.0%, 29.2%, and 27.1% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025,\n2024, and 2023, respectively. As of January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had 4,088, 3,810, and 3,471 customers,\nrespectively, that contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our penetration of\nlarger organizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of Enterprise customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”) is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure that is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nbelieve that FCF is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the\namount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for\nfuture growth. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and has limitations as an analytical\ntool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,\nsuch as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that other companies, including\ncompanies in our industry, may not use this metric, may calculate this metric differently, or may use other\nfinancial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the usefulness of this non-GAAP metric as\na comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nto net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in\naccordance with GAAP:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025             2024            2023\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating              $               1,945,308    $   1,598,836    $  1,290,262\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                              -136,560         -126,953        -103,826\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                   $               1,808,748    $   1,471,883    $  1,186,436\nNet cash used in investing activities       $              -1,106,024    $  -1,183,689    $   -318,322\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing    $              -1,028,077    $      60,186    $   -936,942\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications and\ncollaboration platform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also\nprovide services, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are\ngenerally considered\n55\nTable of Contents\ndistinct from the access to our unified communications and collaboration platform. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract term which\ncan include a free period discount.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-\nlocated data centers, third-party cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses,\namortization of capitalized software development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated\noverhead.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include credit card processing fees related to\nsales and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance and\nlegal organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services; expected\ncredit losses; insurance; certain indirect taxes; litigation settlements; corporate security and regulatory\nexpenses; and allocated overhead.\nGains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, Net\nGains (losses) on strategic investments, net consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses on our equity\ninvestments.\nOther Income, Net\nOther income, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion on our marketable securities and effect\nof changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions\nwhere we conduct business.\n56\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of

The change in income taxes was primarily due to an increase in\nincome before taxes, increases in non-deductible compensation and other permanent items, and a reduction in tax\nshortfalls on stock-based compensation for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025. See Part II, Item 8, Note 12\n“Income Taxes” to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report for further information.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023,\nplease refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\n59\nTable of Contents\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2025, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $7.8 billion, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, macroeconomic\nfactors, such as geopolitical conflicts, tariffs and trade tensions, inflationary pressures, interest rate\nfluctuations, and the fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. These factors and other risks detailed in\nthe section titled “Risk Factors” could impact the timing of cash collections from our customers. However, based on\nour current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable\nsecurities, together with net cash provided by operations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the\nnext 12 months and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We believe we will meet longer-term expected\nfuture cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash flows from operating activities and\navailable cash balances. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our revenue growth\nrate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent of spending to support further sales\nand marketing and research and development efforts, as well as expenses associated with our international\nexpansion, and the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces\nas well as data center infrastructure. We may, in the future, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in\ncomplementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual property rights. We may choose or be\nrequired to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that additional financing is required from\noutside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise\nadditional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and financial condition would be materially\nand adversely affected.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our leases for\noffice space and equipment, as well as non-cancelable purchase obligations. Expected timing of those payments are\nas follows:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $          69,243    $                 27,171    $   29,529    $  12,303    $        240\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         470,102                     236,451       227,497        6,154               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         539,345    $                263,622    $  257,026    $  18,457    $        240\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding.

Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted\nfor certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as\nwell as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,945.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, compared\nto $1,598.8 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. The increase in operating cash flow was mainly\ndriven by higher net income year over year.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,106.0 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 was due to net\npurchases of marketable securities of $964.3 million, purchases of property and equipment of $136.6 million, and\npurchases of strategic investments of $18.5 million, partially offset by proceeds from strategic investments of\n$13.4 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,183.7 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024 was due to net\npurchases of marketable securities of $951.4 million, cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $204.9\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $127.0 million, and purchases of strategic investments of $70.5\nmillion, partially offset by proceeds from strategic investments of $170.1 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $1,028.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 was due to\ncash paid for repurchases of common stock of $1,093.9 million, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common\nstock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $54.0 million, proceeds from employee equity\ntransactions to be remitted to employees and tax authorities, net, of $7.2 million, and proceeds from the exercise\nof stock options of $4.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $60.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was due to\nproceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $54.1 million and\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options of $10.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from employee equity\ntransactions remitted to employees and tax authorities, net, of $4.1 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management’s\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2024.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.5 billion of our Class A\ncommon stock. In November 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $1.2 billion of\nour outstanding Class A common stock. Repurchases of our Class A common stock may be effected, from time to time,\neither on the open market (including pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and other\ntransactions in accordance with applicable securities laws.\nThe timing and the amount of any repurchased Class A common stock will be determined by our management based on its\nevaluation of market conditions and other factors. The repurchase program will be funded using our working capital.\nAny repurchased shares of Class A common stock will be retired. The repurchase program does not obligate us to\nacquire any particular amount of Class A common stock, and the repurchase program may be suspended or discontinued\nat any time at our discretion.\n61\nTable of Contents\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased and subsequently retired 15,888,316 shares of our\nClass A common stock for an aggregate amount of $1.1 billion.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates that require the most difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the\nnature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly\nuncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial\ncondition or operating performance is material.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Part II, Item 8, Note 1 “Summary of\nBusiness and Significant Accounting Policies” to the consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report, the\nfollowing critical estimates involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue\nrecognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract\nterm which can include a free period discount. We apply judgment during the identification of a contract to\ndetermine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the\ncustomer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information\npertaining to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be\nentitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the\ntransaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue\nrecognized under the contract will not occur.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nSignificant judgment is required in arriving at this estimated period of benefit. We determine the period of\nbenefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the\ninitial estimated customer life and the technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform\nand related significant features. Sales commission is generally not paid upon contract renewal. Amortization is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2025, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\n62\nTable of Contents\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or\nchanges in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have\nnot recorded any impairment charges during the fiscal years presented.\nStrategic Investments\nAccounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a\ncontrolling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily\navailable market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs\nor data in an inactive market. The valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent\nlack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our\nstrategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to\nreflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.\nWe assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for indicators for\nimpairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative assessment that evaluates key factors including but\nnot limited to the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at\nwhich the investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at\nfair value by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new\ncarrying value for the investment.\nThe privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other\nsecurities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation\nto movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company\nmay move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of 10% in\nenterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2025 would not have had a\nmaterial impact on the value of our investment portfolio.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is\nrecognized based on the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and\nassets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements\nor tax returns. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current income tax provision\n(benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against a deferred tax asset. The\nassumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current income tax provision (benefit) take into account\ncurrent tax laws, their interpretation and possible results of foreign and domestic tax audits. Changes in tax law,\ntheir interpretation and resolution of tax audits could significantly impact the income taxes provided in our\nconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income\ntaxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and\nchanges to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.",

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a portion of our revenue from\namounts denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the\njurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in Australia, China, Europe and the United\nStates. Our results of current\n63\nTable of Contents\nand future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency\nexchange rates. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023, 19.3% , 19.3% and 20.0% of our revenue,\nrespectively and 16.4%, 13.7% and 10.8% of our expenses, respectively, were denominated in currencies other than\nthe U.S. dollar. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our\nbusiness would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal\nyears ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been\nmaterial to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we\nmay do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1.3 billion and marketable securities of $6.4 billion as of January 31, 2025.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds and high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and\nother debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes\nand have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-\nterm nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks\ndue to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented\nwould not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023.\n64\nTable of Contents",

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January\n31, 2025, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee\nof Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2025 and 2024, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2025, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n66\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $4,665\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2025.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts. Additionally, for the same sample\nof transactions, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the\narrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying performance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the\nsufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

provides an open, AI-first work platform for human connection. Our culture of delivering happiness drives our\nmission and values and is fundamental to everything we do at Zoom. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in\nApril 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose, California.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2025.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Communications,\nInc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary. All intercompany\nbalances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation\nexpense, the fair value of marketable securities, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the valuation of\ndeferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions, and accruals and contingencies. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2025 or 2024. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, or 2023.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases and cash from proceeds\nfrom international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we had $ 12.0million and $ 6.9million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe employees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the amount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding\namount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities.See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\nAccounts receivable, net\n74\nTable of Contents\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January       As of January\n31, 2025            31, 2024\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $        517,306    $        568,449\nLess: Allowance for credit losses             -17,262             -25,916\nLess: Other reserves                           -4,816              -6,455\nAccounts receivable, net             $        495,228    $        536,078\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Other reserves generally represent a reduction of accounts\nreceivable with an offsetting reduction to deferred revenue.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, our assessment took into account recent changes in macroeconomic\nconditions such as inflation pressures, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and uncertain\nenvironments, which may impact our estimates of credit and collectibility trends. Below is a rollforward of our\nallowance for credit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025.\nJanuary 31, 2025       January 31, 2024\n-in thousands\nBalance as of beginning of year    $            25,916    $            24,900\nProvision for credit losses                     22,198                 47,267\nWrite-offs                                     -30,852                -46,251\nBalance as of end of year          $            17,262    $            25,916\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), which is reflected as a component of\nstockholders’ equity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair\nvalue were due to credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through\nallowance for credit losses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized\ngains and losses from the sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method.\nRealized gains and losses are reported in other income (expense), net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nWe hold strategic investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held debt and equity securities in\nwhich we do not have a controlling interest. Publicly held equity securities are measured using quoted prices in\ntheir respective active markets with changes recorded through gains (losses) on strategic investments, net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value\nare recorded at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from\nthe same issuer (i.e. using the measurement alternative) and are recorded through gains (losses) on strategic\ninvestments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIf, based on the terms of these publicly traded and privately held securities, we determine that we exercise\nsignificant influence on the entity to which these securities relate, we will apply the equity method of accounting\nfor such investments.\n75\nTable of Contents\nPrivately held equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method are measured at cost less any\nimpairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss, which is reported in gains (losses)\non strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPrivately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated\nother comprehensive income (loss) on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess our privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio\nfor indicators for impairment.For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we recognized an\nimmaterial amount of impairment to our privately held debt and equity securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications and collaboration platform during the\napplication development stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be\nused to perform the function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and\nequipment, net. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\nincurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s\nestimated useful life, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.We have\ncapitalized $ 14.9million, $ 8.1million, and $ 18.0million of software development costs during the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nLeases\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that\noption. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present\nvalue of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our incremental\n76\nTable of Contents\nborrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as\nour leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate\nthe interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment where the\nleased asset is located. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at\nor before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. We reassess the lease term if and when a\nsignificant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. We currently do not have any finance\nleases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were noimpairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2025, 2024, or 2023.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have onereporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2025 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. We routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-\nlived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period\nof amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the\nuseful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and\ncircumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine that the life of an\nintangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively\nover its estimated remaining useful life.There were noimpairment charges to acquired intangible assets during the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2025.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue\nrecognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract\nterm which can include a free period discount. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n77\nTable of Contents\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications and collaboration platform, which consists of one or more software-based services.\nOur customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we\nprovide a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications and collaboration platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a\nprofessional manner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include\nservice-level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and\npermitting those customers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits\nrepresent a form of variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements\nin the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and related services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the\nrelated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 1% of total revenue during the periods presented.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located\ndata center costs, third-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related\nexpenses, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments,\nand allocated overhead costs. Indirect overhead\n78\nTable of Contents\ncosts associated with corporate facilities and related depreciation, health care benefits, training, and other\nemployee benefits are allocated to cost of revenue and operating expenses based on applicable headcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and\ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $ 50.8million, $\n56.5million, and $ 64.7million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards with only service conditions, including stock options,\nRSUs, and ESPP, are measured based on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on a\nstraight-line basis over the requisite service period. For RSU’s with service and performance conditions, expense\nis recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable the performance condition will be achieved. The\nprobability of achievement is assessed quarterly, and the effect of any change in the estimated number of\nperformance-based awards expected to vest is recognized in the period those estimates are revised as a cumulative\ncatch-up adjustment to stock-based compensation expense.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of assumptions, including the fair value of the\nunderlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock,\nrisk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,\ntax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions on the basis of a two-step process in which (1) we determine whether it is more\nlikely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits of the position and\n(2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we recognize the largest\namount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related\ntax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax positions, which involve significant\njudgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these uncertain tax positions in a manner\ninconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income\ntaxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included with the related tax liability.\n79\nTable of Contents\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock, which includes early exercised stock options, to be participating securities as holders of such\nsecurities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of common\nstock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable\nSegment Disclosures , which aims to improve financial reporting by requiring disclosure of incremental segment\ninformation on an annual and interim basis to enable investors to develop more decision-useful financial analyses.\nASU 2023-07 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods within fiscal years\nbeginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted the ASU as of February 1, 2024, and\napplied the amendments in this Update retrospectively to all prior periods presented in these financial statements.\nOur adoption resulted in the addition of a note to consolidated financial statements, “14. Segment Information.”\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures\n, which aims to improve the transparency of income tax disclosures by requiring consistent categories and greater\ndisaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid disaggregated by jurisdiction. ASU\n2023-09 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024 and early adoption is permitted. We are\ncurrently evaluating the impact from the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2024, the FASB issued ASU No. 2024-03, Income Statement—Reporting Comprehensive Income—Expense\nDisaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses , which aims to improve\nfinancial reporting by requiring additional disclosure about specific expense categories in the notes to financial\nstatements at interim and annual reporting periods. ASU 2024-03 is effective for fiscal years beginning after\nDecember 15, 2026 and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2027. Early adoption is\npermitted. We are currently evaluating the impact from the adoption of this ASU on our consolidated financial\nstatements.\n80\nTable of Contents\n2.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 118.5million and $ 124.8million as of January 31, 2025\nand 2024, respectively, and the amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within other assets, noncurrent on\nthe consolidated balance sheets was immaterial as of January 31, 2025 and 2024.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 1,249.8million, $ 1,257.4million, and $\n1,140.7million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2025, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n3,801.9million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 1,353.7million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 2,448.2million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 59%\nof our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nGenerally, we do not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line\nbasis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid\nfor the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer\nlife and the technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform and related significant\nfeatures. Amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were no impairment losses recorded\nduring the periods presented.\n81\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents a rollforward of deferred contract acquisition costs:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025           2024\n-in thousands\nBeginning balance                       $                 347,198    $   403,241\nAdditions to deferred contract                            246,727        214,657\nacquisition costs\nAmortization of deferred contract                        -282,103       -270,700\nacquisition costs\nEnding balance                          $                 311,822    $   347,198\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,\ncurrent (to be amortized in next 12     $                 188,358    $   208,474\nmonths)\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,                      123,464        138,724\nnoncurrent\nTotal deferred contract acquisition     $                 311,822    $   347,198\ncosts\n3.

Business Combinations\nWorkvivo Limited\nOn April 21, 2023, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Workvivo Limited (“Workvivo”), a\nprivate technology company that provides an employee experience platform, for an all-cash purchase consideration of\n$ 221.8million. The acquisition extends our platform and offers our customers new ways to keep employees informed,\nengaged, and connected. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration, $ 184.7million was attributed to goodwill, $ 28.0million to intangible\nassets (primarily consisting of $ 10.8million to developed technology and $ 17.0million to customer relationships),\nand $ 9.1million to other net assets acquired. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing\nproducts expected to be realized from the acquisition and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill is not\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nAt the date of the acquisition, the developed technology and customer relationships both had an estimated useful\nlife of 5.0years, and both are amortized using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful\nlives. Amortization of developed technology and customer relationships is recorded within cost of revenue and sales\nand marketing expense, respectively, within the consolidated statements of operations. As of January 31, 2025, the\ndeveloped technology and customer relationships both had a remaining useful life of 3.2years.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were immaterial. The results of operations of\nWorkvivo, which are not material, have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the\nacquisition. Pro forma and historical results of operations of the company have not been presented, as the results\ndo not have a material effect on any of the periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations.\n6.

Operating Leases\nWe have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, with remaining contractual periods of up\nto five years. We also enter into equipment operating lease agreements related to our Hardware-as-a-Service\n(“HaaS”) offering. We elect to apply the lessor practical expedient per ASC 842 and account for HaaS with customers\nas a combined performance obligation with the right to access our unified communications and collaboration platform\nunder ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . HaaS was immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Many of our leases contain oneor more options to extend. As leases approach maturity, we consider\nvarious factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist to determine whether\nwe are reasonably certain to exercise the options to extend the lease. Operating lease expense for the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 was $ 26.7million, $ 24.9million and $ 32.7million , respectively, excluding\nshort-term lease costs, variable lease costs, and sublease income, each of which was immaterial for the fiscal\nyears ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023 .\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows:\nAs of January 31,\n2025\nReported as:                                  (in thousands, except life and\nAssets:                                                         percentages)                    2024\nOperating lease right-of-use          $                               55,900               $  58,975\nassets\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other current    $                               27,026               $  24,645\nliabilities\nOperating lease liabilities,                                          37,406                  48,308\nnoncurrent\nTotal operating lease liabilities     $                               64,432               $  72,953\nWeighted average remaining lease                                              3.3 years               3.7 years\nterm\nWeighted average discount rate                                           4.4  %                  4.1  %\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to operating leases was as follows:\n87\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025         2024         2023\n-in thousands\nCash payments included in the\nmeasurement of our operating lease          $                  31,197    $  26,471    $  27,120\nliabilities\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nrecognized in exchange for new operating    $                  21,760    $       —    $  13,857\nlease obligations\nAs of January 31, 2025, the future minimum lease payments included in the measurement of our operating lease\nliabilities are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2025\n-in thousands\nYear Ending January 31,\n2026                                 $                  27,171\n2027                                                    18,017\n2028                                                    11,512\n2029                                                     9,658\n2030                                                     2,645\nThereafter                                                 240\nTotal operating lease payments       $                  69,243\nLess: imputed interest                                  -4,811\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                  64,432\n8.

Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2025, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of less than 12 months of $ 236.5million and non-cancelable purchase obligations with a\nterm 12 months or longer of $ 233.7million.\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes,\n89\nTable of Contents\nthere is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy taxes, fees, and\nsurcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2025 and 2024, we recorded sales and other tax\nliabilities of $ 83.3million and $ 77.7million, respectively, of which $ 41.8million and $ 35.5million are included\nin accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 41.5million and $ 42.3million are included\nin other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, based on our best estimate of\nthe probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those dates. Our estimate of a probable outcome\nunder the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and marketing activities, revenue subject to sales\ntax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each period. No significant adjustments to the sales\nand other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for changes to\nthe assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our assumptions may occur in the future as we obtain\nnew information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability.\nLegal Proceedings\nIn June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York (“EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access\nto user data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took responding to\nlaw enforcement requests from the Chinese government. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of\nJustice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek\ndocuments and information relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our\nencryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public\nstatements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since\nreceived additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of\nthese investigations and have conducted our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing,\nand a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or\nother financial exposure, as well as reputational harm. During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we recorded\nan $ 18.0million accrual with respect to a tentative settlement offer for the SEC matter that remains subject to\nSEC approval. We do not know when these matters will be completed, including the SEC matter, which facts we will\nultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We are\nunable to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters and are unable to reasonably estimate any range of possible\nloss beyond the $ 18.0million settlement offer for the SEC matter.\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors, and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. On October 27, 2021, a\nthird substantially identical lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants, seeking unspecified\nmonetary damages and governance reforms. On November 17, 2021, all threederivative lawsuits were consolidated. The\nconsolidated case was stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. On April 11,\n2023, the court entered a stipulated order that required defendants to answer, move, or otherwise respond to the\noperative complaint by June 12, 2023. On June 12, 2023, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated case.\nOn August 11, 2023, the plaintiff in the consolidated case filed an amended complaint. On October 18, 2023,\ndefendants filed their motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 22, 2023, plaintiff filed her\nopposition to the motion to dismiss, and on January 26, 2024, defendants filed their reply in support of the motion\nto dismiss. On April 1, 2024, the parties notified the court that the parties are engaged in good-faith, material\nsettlement discussions, and requested that the court stay any proceedings and rulings in connection with the\npending motion to dismiss while the parties attempt to reach a proposed resolution of this action. On April 2,\n2024, the Court stayed the case. On January 14, 2025, the parties executed a Stipulation of Settlement\n(“Stipulation”) to resolve this matter. Under the terms of the Stipulation, in exchange for the release and\ndismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the matter, Zoom agreed to enact certain corporate\ngovernance reforms and to pay plaintiff’s counsel a fee award of up to $ 1.35million. The Stipulation and\nsettlement remain subject to preliminary and final approval by the court. On January 16, 2025, plaintiff filed a\nmotion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On February 6, 2025, the court held a hearing on the motion for\npreliminary approval of the settlement. We accrued the $ 1.35million fee award and recorded it as a general and\nadministrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2025.\nWe are vigorously defending ourselves against these lawsuits. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary\nstage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among other things, class certification and\nsuccess on the merits,\n90\nTable of Contents\nexcept as otherwise described above, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss that may\nresult from these actions.\nOn April 7, 2020 and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our officers\nin the United States District Court for the NDCA. The plaintiffs are purported stockholders of ours. The complaints\nallege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 10b-5 by making\nfalse and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about our data privacy and security measures. The\ncomplaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On May 18, 2020, the actions were consolidated. On\nNovember 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On December 23, 2020, the lead plaintiff filed a\nconsolidated complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on May 20, 2021. Plaintiff filed an\nopposition to our motion to dismiss on July 9, 2021. Our reply in support of the motion to dismiss was filed on\nAugust 9, 2021. On February 16, 2022, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion to dismiss. On\nMarch 14, 2022, we moved for reconsideration of the court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss. On March 22, 2022, the\ncourt ordered plaintiff to respond to our motion, which plaintiff did on March 29, 2022. On April 22, 2022, we\nanswered the complaint. On March 8, 2023, the court denied our motion for reconsideration. On April 6, 2023, the\ncourt entered a scheduling order. On July 17, 2023, the parties entered into a stipulation and agreement of\nsettlement (the “Stipulation”) to resolve this matter. Under the terms of the stipulation, in exchange for the\nrelease and dismissal with prejudice of all claims against all defendants in the matter, we have agreed to pay\nand/or cause our insurance carriers to pay a total of $ 150.0million. The Stipulation and settlement remain subject\nto preliminary and final approval by the court. On July 25, 2023, the court entered an order staying further\nproceedings in the matter pending the filing of a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. On October 17,\n2023, lead plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement. A hearing on the motion for\npreliminary approval was held on June 13, 2024, but the court has yet to enter a preliminary approval order. As a\nresult of the settlement, we made net payments of $ 60.0million ($ 150.0million for the settlement net of $\n90.0million covered by insurance) during the year ended January 31, 2024, of which $ 7.5million had been accrued\nduring the year ended January 31, 2023 and $ 52.5million was recorded as a general and administrative expense in\nour consolidated statement of operations for the year ended January 31, 2024.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n10. Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into oneshare of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into oneshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into oneshare of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that are authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nCommon Stock\n91\nTable of Contents\nUpon the completion of the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became\neffective, which also authorized the issuance of 2,000,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $ 0.001par value per\nshare and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share.\nWe have the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:\nAs of January 31,\n2025          2024\nStock options outstanding                        2,394,918     3,314,228\nRSUs outstanding                                23,870,513    26,040,557\nESPP purchase rights outstanding                 2,311,567     2,086,604\nRemaining shares available for future           56,022,675    50,559,254\nissuance under the 2011 and 2019 plan\nRemaining shares available for future           18,807,595    14,712,385\nissuance under the ESPP\nTotal shares of Class A common stock           103,407,268    96,713,028\nreserved\nStock Repurchase Plan\nIn February 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 1.5billion of our Class A\ncommon stock. In November 2024, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $ 1.2billion of\nour outstanding Class A common stock. Repurchases of our Class A common stock may be effected from time to time,\neither on the open market (including preset trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and other\ntransactions in accordance with applicable securities laws. The program does not obligate us to repurchase any\nspecific number of shares and may be discontinued at any time.\nDuring the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased and subsequently retired 15,888,316shares of our\nClass A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 1.1billion. As of January 31, 2025, $ 1.6billion of the\nrepurchase authorization remained available.\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn 2011, we adopted the 2011 Global Share Plan (“2011 Plan”), under which officers, employees, and consultants were\ngranted various forms of equity incentive compensation at the discretion of the board of directors, including stock\noptions and restricted stock awards. In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The awards generally vest over four years. The plan administrator determines the term of stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10years. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock\nthat may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not exceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the\nsum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an additional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of\n(A) shares that remain available for the issuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time\nour 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B) shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or\nother stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or\nexpire prior to exercise or settlement; are not issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because\nof the failure to vest; or are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or\nthe purchase or exercise price, if any, as such shares become available from time to time. In addition, the number\nof shares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance under our 2019 Plan automatically increases on February\n1 of each calendar year, starting on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, in an amount equal to (i) 5% of the\ntotal number of shares of our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on January 31 of the fiscal year\nbefore the date of each automatic increase or (ii) a lesser number of shares determined by our board of directors\nprior to the applicable February 1.\n92\nTable of Contents\nStock Options\nA summary of stock option activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nStock Options\nOutstanding                    Weighted-\nStock       Weighted-    Average\nOptions         Average    Remaining               Aggregate\n(in thousands, except share,        Exercise    Contractual             Intrinsic\nlife and per share data)           Price    Life (Years)                Value\nOutstanding as of January                        3,314,228    $       8.21                  3.9    $    189,921\n31, 2024\nExercised                                         -908,844    $       5.08                         $     62,063\nCanceled/forfeited/expired                         -10,466    $      93.57\nOutstanding and\nExercisable as of                                2,394,918    $       9.02                  2.6    $    187,284\nJanuary 31, 2025\nThere were nooptions granted for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024 and 2023.

A total of\n9,000,000shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar\nyear, beginning on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares\nof our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of\nthe automatic increase, and (2) 7,500,000shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2).\nUnder our current ESPP, Class A common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the\nESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common\nstock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock\non the date of purchase. No employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $ 25,000worth of our\nClass A common stock based on the fair market value per share of our Class A common stock at the beginning of an\noffering for each calendar year such purchase right is outstanding or 3,000shares. The 2019 ESPP provides for, at\nmaximum, 27months offering periods with fouroffering dates, generally in June and December of each year. The first\noffering period began on April 18, 2019. During the fiscal years\n93\nTable of Contents\nended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023, 1,066,977, 921,892, and 678,279shares, respectively, of our Class A common\nstock were purchased under the ESPP.\nAs of January 31, 2025, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to the ESPP was $ 36.2million, which\nis expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6years.\nWe estimated the fair value of ESPP purchase rights using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following\nassumptions:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025                      2024            2023\nExpected term (years)      0.5-2.0                   0.5-2.0         0.5-2.0\nExpected volatility        28.4% -43.3%              30.0% -57.6%    57.6% -64.6%\nRisk-free interest rate    4.2% -5.4%                4.6% -5.4%      2.2% -4.8%\nExpected dividend yield    —                         —               —\nThe stock-based compensation expense by line item in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations is\nsummarized as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,                2025            2024            2023\n-in thousands\nCost of revenue                                                $        124,561    $    143,798    $    174,546\nResearch and development                                                333,767         336,309         361,720\nSales and marketing                                                     319,631         381,298         532,371\nGeneral and administrative                                              153,350         195,756         217,115\nTotal stock-based compensation                                          931,309       1,057,161       1,285,752\nexpense\nBenefit from income taxes                                              -176,463        -197,068        -199,971\nTotal stock-based compensation\nexpense                                                        $        754,846    $    860,093    $  1,085,781\nrecorded to net income\n11.

Based on the available\nobjective evidence during the year ended January 31, 2025, we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax\nbenefits relating to U.S. losses that are capital in nature and certain state deferred tax assets may not be\nrealized prior to expiration. Accordingly, we have maintained a valuation allowance against these deferred tax\nassets and intend to maintain the applicable valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to\nsupport a reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation allowance.\nAs of January 31, 2025, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 1.8million for federal income\ntax purposes, and $ 12.5million for state income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year 2033 if\nunused. We also had certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 22.4million, which have an indefinite\nlife.\nAs of January 31, 2025, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 1.2million for\nfederal income tax purposes and $ 23.4million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development\ntax credits have a twenty-year carryover period while the state research and development tax credits carry forward\nindefinitely.\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n96\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits (in thousands)                         2025         2024         2023\nBalance, beginning of year                  $                  41,772    $  30,404    $  19,171\nTax Positions taken in prior year:\nGross increases                                                   931          228          877\nGross decreases                                                     —            —            —\nTax Positions taken in current year:\nGross increases                                                13,650       12,415       10,547\nGross decreases                                                   -19         -891            —\nLapse of Statute of Limitations                                     —         -384         -191\nAcquisitions                                                        —            —            —\nBalance, end of year                        $                  56,334    $  41,772    $  30,404\nAs of January 31, 2025, gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 56.3million ($\n66.0million total, including $ 9.7million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2024, gross\nunrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 41.8million ($ 46.5million total, including $\n4.7million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2023, gross unrecognized tax benefits related\nto uncertain tax positions were $ 30.4million ($ 32.5million total, including $ 1.6million associated with interest\nand penalties). We recognized approximately $ 9.7million, $ 4.7million, and $ 1.6million in potential interest and\npenalties associated with uncertain tax positions during fiscal years ended January 31, 2025, 2024, and 2023,\nrespectively. To the extent taxes are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, substantially all\namounts accrued (including interest and penalties) will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall\nincome tax provision. Unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties are included in our\nincome tax provision.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2025, all of the years in which net operating losses or tax credits were utilized\nremain open to examination by the federal and state tax authorities. We believe that an adequate provision has been\nmade for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. Although the timing of the resolution, settlement,\nand closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax\nbenefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\nAs required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we started capitalizing research and development expenses incurred\nbeginning in fiscal year 2023. These expenses are capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic research\nand fifteen years for international research. The mandatory capitalization requirement increases our cash tax\nliabilities but also decreases our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction. The cash flow impact will decrease over time as capitalized research and development expenditures\ncontinue to amortize.\n97\nTable of Contents\n13.

Segment Information\nOur CEO is the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) of the Company. The Company manages the business activities\non a consolidated basis and all information provided to and reviewed by our CODM is compiled at the consolidated\nentity level. Therefore, we have only oneoperating and reportable segment. The description of the types of products\nand services from which the reportable segment derives its revenue is the same as those described in the Summary of\nBusiness and Significant Accounting Policies.\nThe measure of segment profit or loss that our CODM uses to allocate resources and assess performance is our\nconsolidated net income. The CODM uses net income to monitor results and to decide whether to reinvest profits. Our\nCODM does not assess segment performance or make decisions using asset or liability information.\n98\nTable of Contents\nThe following table summarizes the significant segment expenses regularly provided to the CODM as well as other\nsegment items:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2025            2024            2023\nRevenue                                   $               4,665,433    $  4,527,224    $  4,392,960\nAdjusted cost of revenue(1)                                 984,916         908,283         912,913\nAdjusted research and development(1)                        500,177         430,117         393,548\nAdjusted sales and marketing(1)                           1,090,294       1,116,356       1,153,660\nAdjusted general and administrative(1)                      252,152         297,580         353,755\nStock-based compensation expense                            931,309       1,057,161       1,285,752\nInterest income                                            -340,474        -210,009         -54,103\nOther segment items(2)                                      -68,525          95,424          98,159\nProvision for income taxes                                  305,346         194,850         145,565\nSegment net income                                        1,010,238         637,462         103,711\nAdjustments and reconciling items                                 —               —               —\nConsolidated net income                                   1,010,238         637,462         103,711\n(1) Excludes stock-based compensation expense and related payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses,\nrestructuring expenses, and litigation settlements, net\n(2) Includes stock-based compensation related payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, restructuring expenses,\nlitigation settlements, net, gains on strategic investments, net, and other income, net excluding interest income\nThe following table presents our property and equipment, net of depreciation and amortization, by geographic\nregion:\nAs of January 31,\n2025\n(in thousands)          2024\nAmericas                             $            238,328    $  202,022\nAPAC                                               51,036        45,321\nEMEA                                               41,111        46,361\nTotal property and equipment, net    $            330,475    $  293,704",

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2025 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\n99\nTable of Contents\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2025 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2025 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
