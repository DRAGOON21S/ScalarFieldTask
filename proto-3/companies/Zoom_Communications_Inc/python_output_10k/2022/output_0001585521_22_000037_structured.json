          "content": "Item 1. BUSINESS\nOverview\nOur mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nZoom enables users to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their\nimagination. Our frictionless communications platform started with video as its foundation, and we have set the\nstandard for innovation ever since. That is why Zoom is an intuitive, scalable, and secure choice for large\nenterprises, small businesses, and individuals alike. We connect people through our core unified communications\noffering, which frictionlessly brings together video, phone, chat, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences\nacross disparate devices and locations. Our Developer Platform enables customers, developers, and service providers\nto easily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-leading video communications platform, with\nopportunities for global discovery and distribution. Our virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to\nseamlessly create and manage engaging events.\nOur cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video and voice solutions that are easy to use, manage,\nand deploy; provides an attractive return on investment; and is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces\nand applications. As businesses around the world navigate a period of significant work transformation, Zoom’s\nability to enable meaningful connections whether teams are in the office, at home, on-the-go, or in other locations\nsuch as a retail or manufacturing setting, is a critical differentiator. We believe that rich and reliable\ncommunications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our\ncustomers place in us by delivering a communications solution that is secure, reliable, and “just works.”\nA cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a full suite of products and features\ndesigned to give users an easy, reliable, and innovative unified communications experience. Users comprise both\nhosts, who organize video meetings, and individual attendees, who participate in those video meetings. In 2019, we\nlaunched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, creating a unique unified communications platform. Many customers\nalso choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-based conference room system, which enables users to easily\nexperience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces. In February 2022, we announced Zoom Contact Center, an\nomnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for video and integrated right into the same Zoom experience.\nThe happiness we bring is recognized by customers. Zoom has consistently high scores across customer review sites,\nincluding Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2 Crowd, including being recognized as a 2021 Gartner Peer\nInsights Customers’ Choice for Meeting Solutions and a TrustRadius Top Rated Web Conferencing Software. Industry\nanalysts also recognize our market leadership: Gartner has named Zoom a leader in its Magic Quadrant for Meeting\nSolutions for the sixth consecutive year, and a leader in the Magic Quadrant for UCaaS for a second year. Frost &\nSullivan recognized Zoom with its 2021 Global Webinars and Virtual Events Market Leadership Award. In 2021, we were\nalso recognized as a leader in IDC’s MarketScapes for UCaaS Service Providers (Small- and Medium-sized Businesses\nand Worldwide Enterprise) and for Worldwide Unified Communications and Collaboration, by Omdia Universe for\nCollaborative Meeting Services, and by Aragon Research Globes for Unified Communications and Collaboration and\nVideo Conferencing. We also received Aragon’s Innovation Award for Video Conferencing in both 2020 and 2021. Zoom\nwas also named to Fortune’s 2021 Future 50 list, which recognized innovative companies with high-growth potential\nwho are creating meaningful value for their customers.\nWe have a unique model that combines viral enthusiasm for our platform with a multipronged go-to-market strategy\nfor optimal efficiency. Viral enthusiasm begins with our users as they experience the simplicity and reliability of\nour platform – it “gets out of the way” so they can focus on what they need to get done together. This enthusiasm\ncontinues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as businesses of all sizes become our customers. Our sales\nefforts funnel this viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer opportunity, which can\ninclude our direct sales force, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners.\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:\nKeep our existing customers happy. We provide happiness to our customers by giving them an experience that\ndelights them. We respond to customer needs with action to drive positive user experiences. We believe these\npractices result in our high scores across customer review sites and will continue to generate referrals from our\nexisting customers, providing meaningful viral adoption for the foreseeable future.\nDrive new customer acquisition. Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nhosts to use our platform, we promote usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the\n6\nTable of Contents\nZoom difference. We complement this lead-generation model with our multipronged go-to-market strategy that\nintegrates the viral enthusiasm for our platform with optimal routes-to-market, including direct sales\nrepresentatives, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners. This approach allows us to cost-effectively\ndrive upgrades to our paid offering and expansion within organizations of all sizes and verticals.\nExpand within existing customers. As organizations experience our platform and become familiar with its benefits,\nmore teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and\nthen organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest\ndeployments. Customers are also purchasing services for webinars, room solutions, and phone for the full Zoom\nUnified Communications as a Service (“UCaaS”) experience.\nInnovate our platform continuously. Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of communication and\ncollaboration technologies. We strive to deliver the best experience to our users by dedicating a portion of\nengineering capacity to developing on-demand, customer-requested features that would be valuable across our\ncustomer base.\nAccelerate international expansion. With users, offices, and data centers strategically located around the world,\nwe are poised to reach new customers globally. Our platform is intuitively designed such that localization\nrequirements are minimal. For example, our platform works without intensive translation requirements with only a\nfew language adjustments to our user interface and support systems.\nGrow our partnership ecosystem and continue to expand our platform. Our platform integrates easily with other\nsystems and tools. We enable developers to embed our platform into their own offerings through open application\nprogram interfaces (“APIs”) and our cross-platform software development kits (“SDKs”). We have already partnered\nwith several hardware video conferencing and peripheral providers and with software providers, including Atlassian\nand Dropbox. Third-party developers are able to engage with the Zoom App Marketplace and Zoom Developer Platform to\nextend the value and adoption of Zoom with our customers through the development of public and private apps and\nintegrations.\nOur Products\nWe provide a unified communications platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact,\nconnecting them through frictionless and secure video, phone, chat, and content sharing. Our core products include\nZoom Meetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Chat, Zoom Rooms, Zoom Hardware-as-a-Service, Zoom Conference Room Connector, Zoom\nEvents, Zoom Webinar, Zoom Developer Platform, Zoom App Marketplace, and Zoom Contact Center.\nZoom Meetings\nZoom Meetings provide HD video, voice, chat, and content sharing across mobile devices, desktops, laptops,\ntelephones, and conference room systems. Our architecture can support up to 1,000 video participants in a single\nmeeting. Conversations can be one to one, one to many, or many to many. Zoom Meetings feature 49-person video\ngallery view, virtual backgrounds, MP4/M4A cloud/local recording with transcripts, video breakout rooms, screen\nsharing with annotation, and integrations with other powerful business applications to help teams get more done\ntogether. Zoom Meetings integrate with tools created by companies such as Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn,\nMicrosoft, Salesforce, and Slack. Our meetings are a flexible tool for on-the-go employees who rely on their mobile\ndevice or tablet throughout their business day.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same 256-bit AES GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by\ndefault, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to\ndistribute these keys to the other meeting participants.\nZoom Phone\nZoom Phone is an enterprise cloud phone system that provides powerful private branch exchange (“PBX”) features,\nsuch as secure call routing, call queuing, call detail reports, call recording, call quality monitoring, voicemail,\nswitch to video, and much more. Available stand-alone, or as an optional add-on to Zoom Meetings, Zoom Phone is a\ncore component of our modern UCaaS strategy that enables customers to replace their existing PBX solution and\nconsolidate all of their business communications and collaboration requirements onto Zoom.\nZoom Phone provides inbound and outbound calling via its support for native connectivity to the public switched\ntelephone network (“PSTN”). In the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, Zoom Phone provided native PSTN connectivity\nin more than 45 countries and territories.\n7\nTable of Contents\nZoom Phone also supports Premise Peering and Cloud Peering, which provide customers with the flexibility to keep\ntheir current PSTN service providers by redirecting existing third-party voice circuits to the Zoom Phone cloud.\nHybrid connectivity is also supported, allowing customers to mix native Zoom Phone calling plans and third-party\nvoice circuits. This unique capability allows customers to enjoy all of the benefits and features of Zoom Phone\nwhile keeping their existing service provider contracts, phone numbers, and calling rates with their preferred\ncarrier of record.\nZoom Chat\nZoom Chat, which is included in the Zoom client for meeting and phone customers, enables organizations and teams to\ncommunicate and collaborate in groups, channels, or 1-1s and to stay connected by instantly sharing messages,\nimages, audio files, and other content across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices. With Zoom Chat, users\ncan easily invite people outside their organization to a chat conversation, and users can quickly switch from a\nchat to a phone call or video meeting during a conversation. Zoom Chat also features content storage for users who\nwant discoverability and the ability to review their conversations or shared files. There are dozens of Zoom Chat\ncompatible applications available in the Zoom App Marketplace that provide notifications and improved workflow for\nother enterprise systems.\nZoom Rooms\nZoom Rooms is our software-based conference room system that transforms every room – from executive offices, huddle\nrooms, training rooms, to broadcast studios – into a collaboration space that is easy to use, simple to deploy, and\nlow-effort to manage. Designed to increase workforce collaboration across in-room and virtual participants, Zoom\nRooms bring one-click to join meetings, wireless multi-sharing, interactive whiteboarding, and intuitive room\ncontrols for a frictionless and secure Zoom Meeting experience. Zoom Rooms can leverage purpose-built hardware,\nsuch as Zoom Rooms Appliances, for a turnkey deployment, or users can customize room builds with Zoom’s open\nhardware ecosystem and professional audio/visual equipment, enabling organizations to build video-enabled spaces\nfor any use case.\nZoom Rooms Scheduling Display helps meet the needs of the agile office by delivering simple, on-the-fly room\nbooking and room utilization management through a calendaring system. With a single Zoom Rooms license, customers\nget unlimited access to this service, requiring only an iOS or Android touch display outside their rooms.\nZoom Rooms Digital Signage leverages displays, in and out of conference rooms, to project image, video, and URL\ncontent playlists. Included as part of Zoom Rooms, role-based admins can easily manage unlimited Digital Signage\ncontent and displays through the Zoom Admin Portal and remotely control the content displayed across screens for\ncorporate communications, internal marketing, branding, and more.\nZoom for Home is a personal home office solution designed to help remote workers connect and be more productive.\nThe leading providers of Zoom for Home compatible devices include Amazon, DTEN, Facebook, Google, Neat, Poly, and\nothers.\nZoom Hardware-as-a-Service\nOur Zoom Hardware-as-a-Service offering allows customers to access the latest and greatest video communication\ntechnology from third party equipment providers. Customers can deploy a world-class communications experience with\na variety of subscription options for phone and meeting room hardware. Customers can also scale video conference\nrooms and phones with hardware options and hardware refreshes at an affordable, fixed monthly price.\nZoom Conference Room Connector\nThe Zoom Conference Room Connector is a gateway for SIP/H.323 endpoints to join Zoom meetings. For organizations\nthat use SIP/H.323 conference room systems from providers, such as Poly and Cisco, Zoom’s Conference Room Connector\ncan take these traditional hardware video conferencing systems to the cloud, allowing users to leverage their\nexisting investments while taking advantage of the Zoom platform. As organizations transition from legacy hardware-\nbased conference rooms to software-based Zoom Rooms, IT administrators save cost on layers of service, maintenance,\nand support contracts and bridge their endpoints with Zoom Conference Room Connector. With the cost-savings,\norganizations can reinvest in video-enabling more rooms and continue to leverage their existing SIP/H.323 endpoints\nwith a consistent, cloud-based experience across all their rooms.\nZoom Events\nZoom Events provides businesses with a virtual event management solution powered by the Zoom platform. Zoom Events\nenables users to manage and host all types of internal and external virtual events, from small interactive sessions\nto multi-day and multi-track events like conferences or consumer events. This includes the ability to create a\n“hub” where all of a business’ events can be listed with corresponding information about each experience. It also\nenables event hosts to provide ticketing and registration for attendees, and the ability to track these activities.\n8\nTable of Contents\nOnZoom is a prosumer-focused virtual event platform and marketplace for Zoom users to create, host, and monetize\nonline events. OnZoom is an extension of Zoom’s unified communications platform with robust monetization (ticketing\nand fundraising) and simpler event management capabilities. OnZoom is currently offered as a public beta for United\nStates (“U.S.”) users to host and attend online events.\nZoom Webinars\nZoom Webinars support interactive video presentations to large audiences from almost anywhere in the world and from\nmany devices. Zoom Webinars scale up to 50,000 people, including up to 100 interactive video panelists. With\nwebinars, hosts have control over the video viewing experience and attendees join to listen, learn and interact\nusing chat, Q&A, live polling and more. Our powerful third-party integrations help users maximize usage of their\nwebinars and expand capabilities with paid registration, marketing automation, lead nurturing, and learning\nmanagement.\nZoom Developer Platform and Zoom App Marketplace\nThe Zoom Developer Platform enables developers, platform integrators, service providers, and customers to easily\nbuild apps and integrations that use Zoom’s video-based communications solutions across video, phone, chat, or\nintegrate Zoom’s core technology into their products and services, with opportunities for co-marketing, discovery\nand distribution. Our developer platform also allows Zoom customers to administer their accounts including managing\napp requests and provisioning, as well as optimizing account usage with access to dashboards and comprehensive\nusage metrics. With our SDKs, APIs, webhooks and extensive developer resources, Zoom, third-party developers, and\npartners build applications that integrate our platform with other globally in-demand applications, platforms,\nwebsites, and services. Our customers also have access to tools and resources to develop private applications that\nintegrate Zoom and Zoom technology into their workflows and systems.\nOur App Marketplace brings together integrations built by Zoom and third-party developers, making it easy for\ndevelopers to publish their apps and for customers to enhance their Zoom experience with new functionalities. The\nApp Marketplace features third-party integrations of Zoom into best of breed apps, Zoom Apps (third-party apps\nintegrated into the Zoom experience) and SDK apps (apps built by ISV program partners using our Meeting SDK). Key\nintegrations include Google Workspace, Calendly, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Salesforce, Otter.ai, Hubspot, Asana,\nKahoot! and Miro.\nZoom Apps combine users' favorite apps with the power of video communications by allowing users to access them\ndirectly in Zoom Meetings. Users can enrich their Zoom experience with a variety of apps that cover many use cases\n— including whiteboarding, project management, note-taking, gaming, and more.\nZoom Contact Center\nIn February 2022, we introduced Zoom Contact Center which combines contact center functionality with our Zoom\nunified communications solutions. Zoom Contact Center is currently available in the U.S. and Canada with additional\ninternational availability planned for later this year.\nOur Technology and Infrastructure\nOur unique technology and infrastructure enable best-in-class reliability, scalability, and performance. We\ndesigned our communications platform to be video-first and cloud-native. Most legacy approaches utilize single\nmultipoint control units (“MCUs”) to bridge video and voice participants into an integrated stream that is\nbroadcast back to the participants. These hardware devices are shipped with defined processing and memory capacity\nthat are difficult to scale. In addition, an MCU architecture is similar to other mainframe-like approaches where\nstream processing and mixing run on the same machine, which is resource-intensive and limits scalability.\nOur technology was specifically designed from the start to address the most difficult component of communications:\nvideo. Video requires intense computing resources for encoding, decoding, multiplexing, and synchronization, as\nwell as higher bandwidth and network performance, to a much higher degree than other forms of communication like\nvoice, chat, and content sharing. Our architecture separates video content processing from the transporting and\nmixing of streams. We allocate video content processing to intelligent agents that reside on client devices and\ndynamically encode and decode based upon the performance of client technology, network performance, and bandwidth.\nWe leverage a next-generation multimedia router that operates on commodity hardware and a globally distributed\ncloud infrastructure to determine the optimal data centers to host a meeting and an optimal set of paths to connect\nthe participants.\nOur Customers\nWe have customers of all sizes, from individuals to global Fortune 50 organizations. Our current customer base\nspans numerous industry categories, including education, entertainment/media, enterprise infrastructure, finance,\ngovernment, health\n9\nTable of Contents\ncare, manufacturing, nonprofit/not for profit and social impact, retail/consumer products, and software/internet.\nNo individual customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nSales\nOur sales model combines our viral demand generation and our free Zoom Meetings plan with a sales approach\noptimized for the size of each customer opportunity. Our direct sales force includes our field sales\nrepresentatives as well as our inside sales team, and it is organized by customer employee count, region, and\nvertical. Our channel team coordinates the activities of resellers and strategic partners to build a strong\necosystem that broadens our reach. Our online channel supports high-volume, high-velocity, self-service sales.\nMarketing\nOur marketing team’s primary objective is to create preference for our brand by leveraging our viral growth,\nenhancing brand perception, and engaging our users with virtual events, content, social media, and customer\nadvisory councils. We complement our viral growth with targeted online and out-of-home advertising. We shifted our\nevents strategy from in-person to online during the pandemic, including hosting Zoomtopia, our annual user\nconference, virtually to tens of thousands of attendees.\nResearch and Development\nWe drive our business with constant innovation. We have research and development presence in the United States,\nIndia, Singapore, and China, which we believe is a strategic advantage for us, allowing us to invest more in\nincreasing our product capabilities in an efficient manner with a “follow the sun” strategy.\nOur Competition\nThe markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We face competition from legacy web-based meeting services\nproviders, including Cisco Webex and GoTo, bundled productivity solution providers with video functionality,\nincluding Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams, and UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including 8x8, Avaya, and\nRingCentral, as well as consumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including\nAmazon, Apple, and Facebook. Additionally, as we build out Zoom Contact Center, we may face additional competition,\nincluding from Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact.\nWe believe we compete favorably based on the following competitive factors:\nvideo-first platform;\ncloud-native architecture;\nfunctionality and scalability;\nease of use and reliability;\nbrand awareness and preference;\nability to utilize existing infrastructure, such as legacy conference room hardware; and\nlow total cost of ownership.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets, as well as contractual protections,\nto establish and protect our intellectual property rights. We actively seek patent protection covering inventions\noriginating from our company. We also pursue the registration and enforcement of trademarks and domain names in the\nUnited States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States.\nWe control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through internal and\nexternal controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners. Our\nsoftware is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy requires employees and\nindependent contractors to sign agreements (1) assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship,\nand other intellectual property generated by them in the course of their employment, and (2) agreeing to protect\nour confidential information.\nIn certain circumstances, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products. This may\ninclude open source software. We take steps to ensure compliance with the terms of the licenses governing such\nlicensed technology. We believe our business is not materially dependent on any individual patent, trademark,\ncopyright, trade secret, license, or\n10\nTable of Contents\nother intellectual property right. For information on the risks associated with our intellectual property, see\n“Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nGovernment Regulation\nOur business activities are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign laws, rules, and regulations.\nCompliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on\nour capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nNevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those\npertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material\nimpact on our business in subsequent periods. For more information on the potential impacts of government\nregulations affecting our business, see “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nHuman Capital\nAs of January 31, 2022, we had 6,787 full-time employees. Of these employees, 4,009 are in the United States and\n2,778 are in our international locations. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union. Employees in\none of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have the benefit of a collective bargaining agreement and are represented by a\nworkers’ council. We have not experienced interruptions of operations or any work stoppages due to labor\ndisagreements.\nOur Culture of Happiness\nWe are focused on delivering happiness to our employees and customers. We strive to change the way business is done\nthrough our communications technology and our company culture. We take happiness so seriously that we have an\nemployee-led happiness committee and crew to facilitate and amplify our efforts to deliver happiness to our\nemployees and customers.\nOur culture of delivering happiness drives our mission, vision, and values and is fundamental to everything we do\nat Zoom:\nMission. Our mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nVision. Our vision is to empower people to accomplish more through video communications.\nValues. We care for our community, our customers, our company, our teammates, and ourselves.\nThis culture supports our hiring and serves as a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining top talent.\nComparably recognized Zoom for numerous culture awards in 2021 including Best Company Happiness and Best CEO. Our\nemployees also named Zoom among the winners of Glassdoor’s Employees’ Choice Awards honoring the Best Places to\nWork in 2021.\nDiversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) at Zoom is an embodiment of our core value of Care. DEI also represents\nour intentional effort to create an inclusive environment of the brightest minds from a broad set of backgrounds in\norder to create the most innovative solutions for our customers. Our approach to DEI is driven across four\nstrategic focus areas: workforce (who and how we hire), workplace (how it feels to work at Zoom), marketplace (how\nwe include our customers) and community (how we help to make the world more equitable).\nWe have taken steps to diversify our candidate outreach through engagements with AfroTech, Merritt College,\nAnitaB.org, and a five-year strategic partnership with Claflin University. In our workplace, our Zoom Talks\ninitiative creates ongoing spaces for our employees to learn more about one another’s unique backgrounds. We have a\nnumber of Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) with a focus on Black, Latinx, Women, Asian and Pacific Islander,\nVeteran, and LGBTQ+ communities. Our ERGs offer our employees support and community building opportunities, and\nhelp to foster an inclusive environment and diverse workplace. Our DEI Team continues to partner with teams leading\nour product design and marketing to invest in making our products even more inclusive and accessible to the diverse\nset of communities we serve.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe offer fair, competitive compensation and benefits that support our employees’ overall well-being. Our employees’\ntotal compensation packages include base pay, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We offer a wide array of\nbenefits including comprehensive healthcare benefits, including mental health and fertility benefits, wellness\nbenefits, a book reimbursement plan to support continuous learning, and charitable gift matching through our Zoom\nCares program.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best\ninterest of our employees as well as the communities in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of\nour employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-\nsite work. We also provide flexible work hours in certain cases. We have also provided a work-from-home\nreimbursement policy to assist employees in that transition.\n11\nTable of Contents\nOver the past year, we conducted a comprehensive employee survey with regular follow-ups and engaged in peer\nresearch to make thoughtful decisions on how to move forward in an evolving world of work. Two priorities were\nimmediately clear: keeping our employees safe and supporting them through a meaningful employee experience. We\nbelieve that the future of work at Zoom will be based on enabling a flexible working environment for our employees.\nWe have created three \"workstyles\" for our employees (in-person, remote and hybrid) and will be allowing most\nemployees to choose their own workstyle.\nCorporate Information\nWe were incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware in April 2011 under the name Saasbee, Inc., and in\nFebruary 2012, we changed our name to Zoom Communications, Inc.

          "content": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nsecurities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business depends on our ability to attract new customers and hosts, retain and upsell additional products to\nexisting customers, and upgrade free hosts to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers and hosts, renewals,\nor upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and maintain and expand our relationships\nwith our customers and hosts, including upselling additional products to our existing customers and upgrading hosts\nto a paid Zoom Meeting plan. A host is any user of our unified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting\nand invites one or more participants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting\nplan as “paid hosts.”\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers\nwill renew their subscriptions utilizing the same tier of their Zoom Meeting plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier,\nor purchase additional products, if they\n12\nTable of Contents\nrenew at all. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, such\nas dissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer or host no longer having a need for our products,\nincluding any new customers or hosts that have subscribed to our services during the COVID-19 pandemic that may\nsubsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the impact of the pandemic has tapered, or the perception that\ncompetitive products provide better, more secure, or less expensive options. In addition, some customers downgrade\ntheir Zoom Meeting plan or do not renew their subscriptions. Furthermore, as a result of the increased usage of our\nplatform during the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer base has shifted largely from businesses and enterprises to a\nmix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. This shift in mix could result in higher non-renewal rates than we\nhave experienced in the past. We must continually add new customers and hosts to grow our business beyond our\ncurrent user base and to replace customers and hosts who choose not to continue to use our platform. Finally, any\ndecrease in user satisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand, word-of-mouth referrals, and\nability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage hosts to upgrade to our paid offerings by\nrecommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand\nwithin organizations by adding new hosts, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of\nZoom into other teams and departments within an organization. At the same time, we strive to demonstrate the value\nof our platform and various product offerings to those hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan, thereby\nencouraging them to upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. However, a majority of these hosts, including those that\nsubscribed to our free plan during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of shelter-in-place and work-from-home\nmandates, may never upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade hosts of our\nfree Zoom Meeting plan to paid subscriptions or expand the number of paid hosts within organizations, our business\nwould be harmed.\nIn addition, our user growth rate may slow or decline in the future as our market penetration rates increase and we\nturn our focus to upgrading our free hosts to a paid Zoom Meeting plan rather than growing the total number of\nusers. If we are not able to continue to expand our user base, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or\ndecline. While we continue to add paid users to our customer base, we expect our user growth rate to continue to\nslow or decline as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to taper, particularly as vaccines become widely\navailable and distributed, and users return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to limitations on\nin-person meetings.\nOur revenue growth rate has begun to decline and we expect our revenue growth rate to generally decline in future\nperiods.\nWe have experienced significant revenue growth in prior periods. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any\nprior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our future performance. Our revenue growth rate has begun to\ndecline and we expect our revenue growth rate to generally decline in future periods. Many factors may contribute\nto declines in our growth rate, including higher market penetration, increased competition, slowing demand for our\nplatform, especially once the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic tapers, particularly as vaccines become widely\navailable and distributed, and users return to work or school or are otherwise no longer subject to limitations on\nin-person meetings, a failure by us to continue capitalizing on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our\nbusiness, among others. Declines in our growth rate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our business\nand the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors,\nincluding increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, would impair the delivery of our services, require\nus to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\nAmazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of our business, as well as\nMicrosoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed meeting architecture,\nwe establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers in\norder to optimize performance on our platform. Damage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past\nresulted in and could in the future result in interruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have\nexperienced, and may in the future experience, other interruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety\nof other factors, including, but not limited to, infrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors,\nviruses, security attacks, ransomware or cyber extortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in\nusage, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these\nproblems within an acceptable period of time. For example, we have experienced partial outages in our services that\nimpacted a subset of our users for a limited number of hours. Additionally, in connection with the addition of new\ndata centers or expansion or consolidation of our existing data center facilities or other reasons, we may move or\ntransfer our data and our users’ metadata to other data centers, not including our China data center. Despite\nprecautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data transfers may impair or cause disruptions in\nthe delivery of our service, and we may incur significant costs in connection with any such move or transfer.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in our services would reduce our revenue; may require us to issue credits or pay\npenalties; may subject us to claims and litigation; and may cause customers and hosts to terminate their\n13\nTable of Contents\nsubscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts. Our ability to attract and\nretain customers and hosts depends on our ability to provide customers and hosts with a highly reliable platform\nand even minor interruptions or delays in our services could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, including increased\nusage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, customers may experience delays or interruptions in service as we seek\nto obtain additional capacity, which could result in the loss of customers who use our unified communications\nplatform because of its reliability and performance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new data centers\nto meet increased demand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a timely manner,\nincluding as a result of current shortages for certain parts, such as servers. In addition, to meet short-term\ncapacity needs, we may need to rely increasingly on public cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services and\nOracle Cloud, which may result in higher variable costs, harming our business, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error; intentional bad acts;\nearthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware failures; systems failures;\ntelecommunications failures; disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and similar events, any of which could disrupt\nour service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it may take a significant\nperiod of time to achieve full resumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning may not account for\nall eventualities. Despite precautions taken at these facilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of\nterrorism, or other act of malfeasance, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other\nunanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our business.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain\nfeatures of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products\noffered by:\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo;\nbundled productivity solutions providers with video functionality, including Microsoft Teams and Google G Suite\nand Meet products;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and\nFacebook.\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect\ncompetition to intensify in the future. For example, we recently introduced Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel\ncontact center solution that is optimized for video, which, as we build out our offering, may result in increased\ncompetition against companies that offer similar services, such as Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact, and new\ncompetitors that may enter that market in the future. Also, in connection with the travel restrictions and stay-in-\nplace policies resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from\nsmaller customers, many of whom are consumers or small and medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller\ncustomers, we face competition from more consumer-oriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the\nconsumer market than we do. Further, many of our actual and potential competitors benefit from competitive\nadvantages over us, such as greater name recognition; longer operating histories; more varied products and\nservices; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing relationships; more third-party integration; greater\naccessibility across devices or applications; greater access to larger user bases; major distribution agreements\nwith hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater financial, technical, and other resources. Some of our\ncompetitors may make acquisitions or enter into strategic relationships to offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. These combinations may make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these\ntrends to continue as competitors attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their video communications needs. There can be no assurance that we will not be\nforced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses to\nattract and retain customers in\n14\nTable of Contents\nresponse to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business. We, on occasion, offer customers a free\nperiod of time at the beginning of the subscription term that can result in deferred billings or long-term accounts\nreceivable and increase the risk of loss on uncollected accounts receivable.\nOur quarterly results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the\nunderlying performance of our business.\nOur quarterly results of operations have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly, and period-to-\nperiod comparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter\nshould not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate\nas a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully\nreflect the underlying performance of our business. For example, beginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30,\n2020, we faced unprecedented usage of our unified communications platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a\nsignificant portion of which is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet\nthis increased demand, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading\nour infrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have had to rely on\npublic cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Fluctuation in quarterly results may negatively impact the\nvalue of our securities. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations include,\nwithout limitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced tiers of Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to attract new hosts and upgrade hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan to one of our\npaid Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\nthe length of our sales cycles, especially with respect to sales to large enterprises and highly regulated\nindustries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agencies;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases; and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service; network outages; or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits; regulatory actions or investigations; legislator scrutiny; or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\n15\nTable of Contents\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our competitors, or\nto cancel their subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users grow and their usage\nof communications capacity increases, including increased usage stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, we will be\nrequired to make additional investments in network capacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the\navailability of which may be limited, or the cost of which may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity\nis not available to us as our user base grows, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high\ndata transmission capacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third\nparties providing internet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not\nhave access to our platform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate\nof adoption of new technologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently\nadapt to the increased demand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause\ncurrent or potential users to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our\ncompetitors or to avoid our platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by\nrestricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by\ncharging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform\nless attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, subject to certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The\norder requires broadband providers to publicly disclose accurate information regarding network management\npractices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of their broadband internet access services sufficient\nto enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and\nother small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June\n11, 2018. Numerous parties filed judicial challenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to\nthe new rules, but reversed the FCC’s decision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband\ninternet service, requiring case-by-case determinations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the\nFCC’s rules. The court also required the FCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to\nremain in effect, while the FCC conducts that review. On February 6, 2020, the court denied requests for rehearing\nof the original decision, and the deadline for petitions requesting the Supreme Court to review the decision has\npassed without the filing of any such petitions. On February 19, 2020, the FCC released a public notice asking for\ncomment on the three issues the court required it to reexamine. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order\nconcluding that the three issues remanded by the court did not provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018\norder. Petitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending. Democratic control of the Executive Branch,\nCongress, and the FCC following the 2020 elections increases the likelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse\nthe 2018 decision or adopt new network neutrality rules. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are\nadopting or considering legislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. A\nfederal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network\nneutrality law, and as a result, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. On March 10, 2021, trade\nassociations representing internet service providers appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary\ninjunction, and the appeal was denied on January 28, 2022. The trade associations have sought rehearing with the\nfull court of appeal. We cannot predict whether the FCC order or other state initiatives will be enforced,\nmodified, overturned, or vacated by legal action of the court, federal legislation, or the FCC. Under the FCC’s new\nrules, broadband internet access providers may be able to charge web-based services such as ours for priority\naccess or favor services offered by our competitors or by the internet access providers themselves, which could\nresult in increased costs and a loss of existing customers and hosts, impair our ability to attract new customers\nand hosts, and harm our business.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\nrepealed, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\n16\nTable of Contents\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen, and we could experience greater\ndeployment challenges.\nAs we continue to grow, we have begun investing more resources into sales to large organizations. Large\norganizations typically undertake a significant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size,\norganizational structure, and approval requirements, all of which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may also face\nunexpected deployment challenges with large organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large\norganizations may demand additional features, support services and pricing concessions, or require additional\nsecurity management or control features. We may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to large\norganizations without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales or that these customers will deploy our\nplatform widely enough across their organization to justify our substantial up-front investment. As a result, we\nanticipate increased sales to large organizations will lead to higher up-front sales costs and greater\nunpredictability in our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies\nmarket fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, or if any new customers or hosts that have\nsubscribed to our services during the COVID-19 pandemic subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the\nimpact of the pandemic has tapered, demand for our platform could be negatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\nease of adoption and use;\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe expect to increase our expenses in the future, which could decrease our profitability or prevent us from\nmaintaining profitability.\nAlthough we generated net income of $1,375.6 million, $672.3 million, and $25.3 million for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, we have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses\nin the future. We intend to continue to expend significant funds to expand our direct sales force and marketing\nefforts to attract new customers and hosts and to develop and enhance our products and for general corporate\npurposes, including operations, hiring additional personnel, including through acquisitions of other businesses,\nupgrading our infrastructure, and addressing security and privacy issues, including those stemming from the\nunprecedented numbers of first-time users during the COVID-19 pandemic who may not have full IT support or\nestablished protocols like our larger customers, and expanding into new geographical markets. To the extent we are\nsuccessful in increasing our user base, we may also incur increased losses because, other than sales commissions,\nthe costs associated with acquiring customers and hosts are generally incurred up front, while the subscription\nrevenue is generally recognized ratably over the subscription term, which can be monthly, annual, or on a multiyear\nbasis. Our efforts to grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our\n17\nTable of Contents\nrevenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses, which may result in decreased profitability. We may incur\nsignificant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a result of the other risks described\nherein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. For example, we\nhave faced unprecedented usage during the COVID-19 pandemic and, to meet this increased demand, have incurred and\nexpect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our infrastructure and expanding our\ncapacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have to rely on public cloud providers rather than our\nown data centers. While free users continue to be a meaningful portion of the user base, we have directed marketing\nprograms focused on converting free users to paid subscriptions. Some of these new hosts using our platform on a\nfree Basic account have upgraded to a paid Zoom Meeting plan but the remainder have not and may never do so. If we\nare unable to increase or sustain our profitability, the value of our business and Class A common stock may\nsignificantly decrease. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, customer\ndemand for our platform, user adoption and renewal of our platform, the entry of competitive products and services,\nor the success of existing competitive products and services. As a result, we may not increase or maintain\nprofitability in future periods. If we fail to grow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and\nother expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these and other third-party operating systems and\napplications that we do not control. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other\nproductivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors\nown, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other\nsoftware, and also have material business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute\noperating systems, applications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform\nrequires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and\nservices that more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business\npartners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products\nevolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors modify their products or\nstandards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to\ncompetitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the\ninteroperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Meetings product integrates with tools offered by\ncompanies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and\nexpand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are\nquality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’\nsolutions, our business will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple recently began requiring mobile applications using its\niOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising\nidentifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other privacy and regulatory changes remains\nuncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app stores, we could lose access to the app\nstore and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from\ncustomers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and\nproducts; and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.\nOur customers may require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We invest\nsignificantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality\nand ease of adoption, enhance privacy and security, and create organic\n18\nTable of Contents\nuser demand for our platform. There is no assurance that new additions or other future enhancements to our platform\nor new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance, or\nthat they will perform as expected. If our research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user\ndemand or if we fail to develop our platform in a manner that satisfies user preferences and requirements in a\ntimely and cost-effective manner, we may fail to retain our existing users or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing\nthat could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features,\nor capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and\ncapabilities and there can be no assurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released\naccording to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or\nclaims by users brought against us, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to\nour platform may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful.\nIf customers and hosts do not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not\nperform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop,\nlicense, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such\nenhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer and host base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and\nservices will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan\nto continue expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and internationally. If we are\nunable to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel in the near term, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to\nacquire customers and hosts is high due to these marketing and sales efforts. Our business will be harmed if our\nefforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We will not achieve anticipated revenue\ngrowth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel, our\nnew sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our\nsales and marketing programs are not effective.\nOur security measures have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security\nmeasures are compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation,\nexpose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products\nand services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and hosts curtailing or\nceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed.\nOur operations involve the storage and transmission of customer and user information. Security incidents have\noccurred in the past and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss or unauthorized\ndisclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of, this information, interruptions, delays, or outages in our operations\nand services, regulatory investigations or enforcement actions, litigation, indemnity obligations, and other\npossible liabilities, as well as negative publicity, which could damage our reputation, impair our sales, and harm\nour business.\nCyberattacks and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase, and cloud-based platform providers\nof products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. In addition to traditional computer\n“hackers,” we face security risks from sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and advanced\npersistent threat intrusions. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to\nsocial-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms),\nmalware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as\ncredential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions,\nsoftware or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, telecommunications\nfailures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including those perpetrated by\norganized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly\nprevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income,\nreputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware\nattack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations\nprohibiting such payments. If our security measures are compromised, our reputation could be damaged; our data,\ninformation or intellectual property, or that of our\n19\nTable of Contents\ncustomers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised; our business may be harmed; and we could incur\nsignificant liability. We have not always been able in the past and may be unable in the future to anticipate or\nprevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in our services or software or third-party\nsoftware, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise our systems, because such threats and techniques change\nfrequently and are generally not detected until after an incident has occurred. In addition, security researchers\nand other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to actively search for and exploit actual\nand potential vulnerabilities in our software or services. This activity may increase because of increased demand\nfor our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified communications platform, and can lead to additional\nadverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats, business and operational interruptions, security\nincidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory investigations and actions, and substantial harm to our\nbusiness, some of which we have experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, in July 2019, a security\nresearcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the Zoom Meeting platform, including certain video-on\nfeatures. We were able to release updates to the software addressing these vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of\nany customers being affected or meetings compromised by these vulnerabilities. In most cases customers are\nresponsible for installing this update to the software, and their software is subject to these vulnerabilities\nuntil they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security researcher reported certain vulnerabilities related to\nour macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized person to gain root access to a user’s system.\nGiven the nature of our business and operations, our products and services will inevitably contain vulnerabilities\nor critical security defects that have not been identified or remediated and cannot be disclosed without\ncompromising security. We have identified vulnerabilities in our products and services in the past, and we expect\nthat we will continue to identify vulnerabilities in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be able to\naddress any vulnerabilities in our software products and services that we may become aware of in the future, or\nthere may be delays in developing patches that can be effectively deployed to address vulnerabilities. We expect\nsecurity issues to arise in the future as our products and services are more widely adopted, and as we continue to\nexpand the features and functionality of existing products and introduce new products.\nWhile we have invested and expect to continue to invest significant resources in an effort to protect against\nsecurity incidents and to mitigate, detect, and remediate actual and potential vulnerabilities, we will continue to\nmake prioritization decisions to determine which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and the timing of these\nfixes, which could result in an exploit that compromises security. Further, in many cases, customers are\nresponsible for installing our software updates, and until they do so, their service remains subject to the\nvulnerabilities addressed in the software update. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, errors in\nremediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remediate vulnerabilities or\nsecurity defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to install software updates could\nresult in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nSecurity incidents and vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and information security\nmay also cause some of our customers and hosts to stop using our solutions and fail to upgrade or renew their\nsubscriptions. Further, as we rely on third-party and public-cloud infrastructure, we depend in part on third-party\nsecurity measures to protect against unauthorized access, cyberattacks, and the mishandling of data and\ninformation. Failures to meet customers’ and hosts’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality of\ntheir data and information could damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and hosts,\nattract new customers and hosts, and grow our business. In addition, cybersecurity events or security\nvulnerabilities could result in breaches of our agreements with customers, lawsuits against us (including class\naction litigation), regulatory investigations or actions, and significant increases in costs, including costs for\nremediating the effects of such an event or vulnerability, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease in\ncustomer, host, and user trust, increases in insurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs to\naddress cybersecurity issues, and attempts to prevent future incidents, fines, penalties, judgments and\nsettlements, and attorney fees, and harm to our business and our reputation because of any such incident.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving\ncertain types of personal data. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach\nis costly. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches. Security\ncompromises experienced by our competitors, our customers, or us may lead to public disclosures, which may lead to\nwidespread negative publicity. In addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States,\nlike many similarly situated technology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel\nin China, which has exposed and could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as market and\nmedia scrutiny regarding the actual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy features.\nAny security compromise in our industry, whether actual or perceived, could harm our reputation, erode confidence\nin the effectiveness of our security measures; negatively affect our ability to attract new customers and hosts;\ncause existing customers to elect not to renew their subscriptions; or subject us to third-party lawsuits,\nregulatory investigations, proceedings, and fines, or other action or liability, which could harm our business and\nreputation. Increased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional awareness of Zoom and our\nbrand could lead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a\n20\nTable of Contents\nnegative perception of our information security and potential vulnerabilities associated with, our platform. For\nexample, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time\nusers, leading to challenges for users who did not have full IT support or established protocols for security and\nprivacy like our larger customers. As a result, we have experienced negative publicity related to meeting\ndisruptions and security and privacy issues, including on encryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could\nresult in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation\nexposure, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of\nuse, or other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities\nor damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability\ninsurance coverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on\nacceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer\nwill not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that\nare not covered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our\nbusiness.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\nWe believe that our brand identity and awareness have contributed to our success and have helped fuel our efficient\ngo-to-market strategy. We connect people through frictionless and secure video, voice, chat, and content sharing.\nWe also believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers,\nhosts, and users and, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad\ncommunications platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users incorrectly view the Zoom\nbrand primarily as a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform with multiple\ncommunications solutions, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market position may\nbe detrimentally impacted. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and\nenhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or perception of our\nplatform, including any delays or interruptions in service due to capacity constraints stemming from increased\nusage due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or of our privacy or security features, or of the providers of communication\nand collaboration technologies generally, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and\nretain hosts. Similarly, any unfavorable perception of our company, including due to any actual or perceived\nviolation by our employees of our policies, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause us\nreputational harm and customer loss, impact our financial performance, expose us to litigation, and harm our\nbusiness, among other things. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom brand, including consumer and public\nperception of our platform or our company, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business will be\nharmed.\nWe may not successfully manage our growth or plan for future growth.\nSince our founding in 2011, we have experienced rapid growth. For example, our headcount has grown from 4,422 full-\ntime employees as of January 31, 2021, to 6,787 full-time employees as of January 31, 2022, with employees located\nboth in the United States and internationally. The growth and expansion of our business places a continuous,\nsignificant strain on our management, operational, and financial resources. Further growth of our operations to\nsupport our user base, our expanding third-party relationships, our information technology systems, and our\ninternal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we continue to\ngrow, we face challenges integrating, developing, and motivating a rapidly growing employee base in various\ncountries around the world. For example, a significant number of our employees were hired in the last two years and\nhave never been to one of our office locations. Certain members of our management have not previously worked\ntogether for an extended period of time, and some do not have prior experience managing a public company, which may\naffect how they manage our growth. Managing our growth will also require significant expenditures and allocation of\nvaluable management resources.\nIn addition, our rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to effectively plan for\nand model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future, risks and uncertainties\nfrequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to achieve the necessary\nlevel of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately forecast future growth,\nour business would be harmed.\nOur business may be significantly affected by a change in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer\nor business spending.\nOur business may be affected by changes in the economy generally, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,\nany resulting effect on spending by our customers, and inflation. While some of our customers may consider our\nplatform to be\n21\nTable of Contents\na cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others may view a subscription to our platform as\na discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their discretionary spending on our platform during an\neconomic downturn. Given current economic conditions, including inflation, we could experience a reduction in\ndemand and loss of customers, especially if the effects of the current economic environment have a prolonged impact\non various industries that our unified communications platform addresses. We would lose customers as a result of\ncustomers ceasing to do business, and we could experience a material increase in longer payment cycles and greater\ndifficulty in collecting accounts receivable from certain customers. While we have seen increased usage stemming\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of the increase in usage of our platform is attributable to free\nBasic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. Moreover, while we continue to add paid users to our customer\nbase, we expect our user growth rate to continue to slow or decline as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic\ncontinues to taper, particularly in light of a potential economic downturn.\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing hosts and make it more difficult to attract new customers and hosts;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, Europe,\nMiddle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). All of our executive officers are at-will employees,\nand we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Any changes in our senior management team in\nparticular, even in the ordinary course of business, may be disruptive to our business. While we seek to prepare\nfor such transitions, including by establishing strong processes and procedures and succession planning, such\nchanges may result in a loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. If our senior\nmanagement team fails to work together effectively or execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis as a\nresult of management turnover or otherwise, our business could be harmed.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need\nto be altered to address a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement\n22\nTable of Contents\nsuch changes in a timely manner. In addition, we have experienced and may continue to experience employee turnover\nas a result of the ongoing “great resignation” occurring throughout the U.S. economy. New hires require training\nand take time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and\nwe may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If we fail to attract new personnel\nor fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing\nemployers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and\nresources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to\nrecruit internationally. Moreover, as we plan to reopen our offices, vaccine mandates and similar government orders\nand restrictions could result in employee attrition and difficulty in recruiting. We must also continue to retain\nand motivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development\nopportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\nIn addition, as our stock price has fluctuated since our IPO, employees joining us at different times could have\nsignificant disparities in proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets, which could create disparities\nin wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among employees and our business. Further,\nthe volatility of our stock price may make our equity compensation less attractive to current and potential\nemployees, and could contribute to increased turnover or difficulties in hiring.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major\nopportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 33%, 31%, and 19% of our total revenue for the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in further\nselect international markets over time. Our customers include multinational corporations with global users, and we\nexpect to continue to expand our international operations, which may include opening offices in new jurisdictions\nand providing our platform in additional languages to support the needs of these multinational corporations. Any\nnew markets or countries into which we attempt to allow users to access our services or sell subscriptions to our\nplatform may not be receptive. For example, if we are not able to satisfy certain government- and industry-specific\nrequirements, we may experience service outages or other adverse consequences which would impair our ability to\nexpand further into certain markets. In addition, our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations\ninternationally in the future may require considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international\nexpansion will require investment of significant funds and other resources. We also face risks related to\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees outside the United States, including complying with complex\nemployment- and compensation-related laws, regulations, and practices in these international jurisdictions, and\nmaintaining our company culture across all of our offices. We may also be unable to grant equity compensation to\nemployees in certain countries outside of the United States due to the complexities of local laws and regulations.\nThis may require us to offer equally compelling alternatives to supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash\ncompensation plans or increased short-term cash compensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees\nin these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection, and\nunsolicited email,\n23\nTable of Contents\nand the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees if our practices are deemed to be\nout of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as does the United States;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as does the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our non-core intellectual property that resides outside of the United\nStates, such as the risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual\nproperty outside of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\npolitical and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom's (“U.K.”) withdrawal from the\nEuropean Union (“EU”), and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the imposition of new trade restrictions, trade\nprotection measures, import or export requirements, trade embargoes, and other trade barriers;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our customers' ability to pay for our service on a\ntimely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nIn addition, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, NATO deployed additional military\nforces to Eastern Europe, and the United States, European Union, and other nations announced various sanctions\nagainst Russia. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be taken in\nfuture, by the U.S., NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could result in a\nregional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of which could\nadversely affect our business.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and\ncriminal penalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and\nregulations or manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease\noperations in certain foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, while our engineering team is headquartered in the\nUnited States, we employ a product development team that has a relatively significant footprint in China today,\nwhere personnel costs are less expensive than in many other geographies. This product development team carries out\nthe design and architecture decisions made by our U.S. engineering team. We also intend to expand our research and\ndevelopment presence in Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, as well as in Singapore and India. As a\nresult of this expansion, we could experience, among other things, difficulty in attracting and retaining talent in\nthese locations and higher operating expenses, which would adversely impact our operating margins and harm our\nbusiness.\nAt the same time, our operations in China have caused and may in the future cause us to be subject to regulatory\nscrutiny both in China and in the United States. For example, in September 2019, the Chinese government turned off\nour service in China without warning and requested that we take certain steps prior to restoring our service,\nincluding designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests and transferring China-based user data\nhoused in the United States to a data center in China. Also, in June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the\nDepartment of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\n24\nTable of Contents\nEastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of California (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our\ninteractions with foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well\nas about storage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY\nsubpoena requested information about the actions we took relating to the Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. The NDCA\nsubpoena also requested documents and information about (among other things) contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We are fully\ncooperating with these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These\ninvestigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover\nas a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the\noutcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur\nsubstantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of\ncustomer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and hosts could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers that increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced tier of Zoom Meeting plan\nmust be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and hosts may harm our relationships with our customers\nand hosts and, consequently, our business.\nWe have designed our platform to be easy to adopt and use with minimal to no support necessary. However, if we\nexperience increased user demand for support, we may face increased costs that may harm our results of operations.\nSurging demand during the COVID-19 pandemic has required us to allocate additional resources to support our\nexpanded user base, including many hosts and customers who are using our platform for the first time. In addition,\nas we continue to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue to provide\nefficient support that meets our customers and hosts’ needs globally at scale. Customers and hosts receive\nadditional support features, and the number of our hosts has grown significantly, which will put additional\npressure on our support organization. If we are unable to provide efficient user support globally at scale or if we\nneed to hire additional support personnel, including as a result of increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic,\nour business may be harmed. Our new customer and host signups are highly dependent on our business reputation and\non positive recommendations from our existing customers and hosts. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or\na market perception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our customers and hosts, would harm our\nbusiness.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our reseller or potential reseller to favor\ntheir products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant\ntime and resources. If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to\nscale and improve our processes and procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and\ntraining. Many resellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to\n25\nTable of Contents\neffectively sell our platform. If we fail to maintain relationships with our resellers, fail to develop\nrelationships with new resellers in new markets, or expand the number of resellers in existing markets or fail to\nmanage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing resellers, our ability to increase the number of\nnew customers and hosts and increase sales to existing customers could be adversely impacted, which would harm our\nbusiness.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we will become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nsmall amount is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of\nthe jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\n22.6%, 20.2%, and 9.4% of our revenue, respectively, and 16.8%, 11.9%, and 17.5% of our expenses, respectively,\nwere denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies other than U.S.\ndollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure to fluctuations\nin currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and earnings and could\nmaterially impact our results of operations. We do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S.\ndollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities and other government contractors are subject to a number of additional challenges\nand risks.\nWe expect to increase our sales to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency customers, which may\noccur through sales to other companies that re-sell our services to government customers and/or through direct\nsales to government entities. We received authorization under the U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) that allows U.S. federal government agencies and contractors to securely use our Zoom for\nGovernment offering. The additional risks and challenges associated with doing business with governmental entities\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense and ongoing compliance costs without any assurance\nthat these efforts will generate a sale;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector\nuntil we have attained such certificates;\ncontracts with governmental entities and other government contractors, including resellers in the government\nmarket, contain terms that differ less favorably from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements,\nincluding, terms and conditions required by regulation that are not negotiable with the customer;\nnon-compliance with terms and conditions of government contracts, or with representations or certifications made\nin connection with government contracts, can result in significantly more adverse consequences than we typically\nwould expect in the commercial market, including, depending on the circumstances, criminal liability, liability\nunder the civil False Claims Act, and/or suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental entities;\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced by public sector budgetary cycles and funding\nauthorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector demand for our\nproducts; and\ngovernment-imposed vaccine mandates could result in increased attrition and difficulties in recruiting, and non-\ncompliance with any such mandates could restrict our ability to do business with governmental entities.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities and/or other government contractors\nin the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nIn May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional\ninformation technology security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor\nauthentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records\nlaws and other applicable laws. The Executive Order will lead to the development of secure software development\npractices and/or criteria for a consumer software labeling program, which will reflect a baseline level of secure\npractices, for software that is developed and sold to the U.S. federal government. Software developers will be\nrequired to provide visibility into their software and make security data publicly available. Due to this Executive\nOrder, federal agencies may require us to modify our cybersecurity practices and policies, thereby increasing our\ncompliance costs. If we are unable to meet the requirements of the Executive Order, our ability to work with the\nU.S. government may be impaired and may result in a loss of revenue.\n26\nTable of Contents\nOur current products, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and hosts or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and hosts and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing products or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, may fail to engage, retain, and increase\nour base of customers and hosts or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New products may initially\nsuffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products\nto new and existing customers and hosts. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our products, or\nthe introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and hosts, or do not perform as expected, we may fail to generate\nsufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments in such products, any of which may\nharm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In addition, our current products, as well as products,\nfeatures, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may require us to compensate or reimburse third\nparties. For example, our cloud phone system, Zoom Phone, is a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate\ncarriers that operate the PSTN. As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers that\nwill use our Zoom Phone product will be allocated towards compensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our\nmargins for Zoom Phone as compared to our other products. In addition, new products that we introduce in the future\nmay similarly require us to compensate or reimburse third parties, all of which would lower our profit margins for\nany such new products. If this trend continues with our new and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could\nharm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid host base to decline significantly.\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our\neffective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings and losses in countries with\ndiffering statutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses;\nchanges in excess tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to\nuse, deferred tax assets; the applicability of withholding taxes; and effects from acquisitions.\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples; changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals; other\nfundamental changes in tax law currently being considered by many countries; and changes in taxing jurisdictions’\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit\nby U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we\ntake, and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our business could be\nadversely impacted.\n27\nTable of Contents\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses\neffective for years beginning after December 31, 2021. Absent a change in legislation, we expect it will have a\nmaterial impact on our cash flows beginning in the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. Although Congress is\nconsidering legislation that would defer the amortization requirement to later years, we have no assurance that the\nprovision will be deferred, repealed, or otherwise modified.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed or enacted Digital Services Taxes (“DST”), many of which would apply to revenue derived from digital\nservices. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions outside of the OECD's\nInclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our business by increasing\nour future tax obligations.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nFor state income tax purposes, there may be periods during which the use of net operating losses is suspended or\notherwise limited, including a California franchise tax law change limiting the usability of California state net\noperating losses to offset California taxable income in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2020 and\nbefore January 1, 2022.\nWe have maintained a valuation allowance on all our U.S. and U.K. net deferred tax assets since our inception as it\nwas determined that it was more likely than not that we would not recognize the benefits of these assets. We\ncontinued to record a valuation allowance through the first nine months of fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter of\nfiscal 2022, management concluded that the valuation allowance related to the U.S. federal and state deferred tax\nassets was no longer needed primarily due to its assessment of income/loss in recent periods and the forecast of\nfuture taxable income. As of January 31, 2022, based on evaluation of the positive and negative evidence,\nmanagement believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized for U.S. federal\nand state purposes. Accordingly, management has recognized a non-recurring tax benefit of $328.0 million related to\nthe valuation allowance reversal. As of January 31, 2022, we continued to maintain a valuation allowance of $12.6\nmillion related to net deferred tax assets of our U.K. subsidiary and will maintain this valuation allowance until\nthere is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or a portion of the allowance.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We\nhave limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not\nbe able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not\nultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be\nviewed negatively by users, developers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired\nbusinesses successfully or effectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to\nsuccessfully integrate our acquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our\ncompany, the results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process\nwill require significant time and resources, require significant attention from management and disrupt the ordinary\nfunctioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully, which could harm our\nbusiness. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast\nthe financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nBeginning in the fiscal quarter ended April 30, 2020, we faced unprecedented usage of our unified communications\nplatform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our business, and we\nhave a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for\nand model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our\nfuture performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue\n28\nTable of Contents\ngrowth could slow or our revenue could decline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our\nplatform; increased competition; contraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for\nour platform and plan for capacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth\nopportunities. The COVID-19 pandemic has also made it difficult to forecast revenue, costs, and expenses, as our\nplatform has recently faced unprecedented usage from free users and new and existing customers, requiring us to\ndevote significant resources to bolster our capacity and infrastructure. We have encountered and will encounter\nrisks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the\nrisks and uncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use\nto plan our business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would\nbe harmed.\nWe rely on data from tools to calculate certain of our key business metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such\nmetrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track our key business metrics with tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our tools have\nlimitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our performance metrics, including the key metrics we report. If the tools we use to track\nthese metrics over- or undercount performance or contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate and our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business may be distorted, which could affect our longer-term strategies.\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure our key business metrics, and regularly review our\nprocesses to assess potential improvements.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners, or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nprivacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and contractual\nobligations could harm our reputation and business or subject us to significant fines and liability.\nWe receive, store, process, generate, use, and share personal information and other customer and user content\nnecessary to provide our service and ensure it is delivered effectively, to operate our business, for legal and\nmarketing purposes, and for other business-related purposes. There are numerous federal, state, local, and\ninternational laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, information security and the collection,\nstoring, sharing, use, processing, transfer, disclosure, and protection of personal information and other content,\nthe scope of which is changing, subject to differing applications and interpretations and may be inconsistent among\ncountries, or conflict with other rules. We are also subject to the terms of our privacy policies and contractual\nobligations to third parties related to privacy, data protection, and information security. Although we endeavor to\ncomply with applicable laws and our policies, publications, certifications, and documentation, and other\nobligations, we may at times fail to do so or may be perceived to have failed to do so. Moreover, despite our\nefforts, we may not be successful in achieving compliance if our employees, vendors or business partners do not\ncomply with our policies, certifications, and documentation. Any actual or perceived compliance failure, as well as\ngreater public scrutiny of our privacy, data protection, and information security practices, could result in\nincreased governmental and regulatory scrutiny and litigation exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a\nloss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nFor example, in June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s\nOffice for the EDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign\npolitical parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user\ndata, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to the\nTiananmen commemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various\nsecurity, data protection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as\nwell as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks\ninformation relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any\nattempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as\nthey relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking\nrelated information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own\nthorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed,\nwhich facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or\nmay not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these\nmatters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material\nreputational harm, a loss of customer and user confidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our\nbusiness.\n29\nTable of Contents\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new or amended laws, regulations, industry standards, guidance and\ncontractual obligations concerning privacy, data protection, and information security proposed and enacted in\nvarious jurisdictions. For example, in May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) went into effect\nin the EU, and the United Kingdom (U.K.) implemented the U.K. GDPR. The GDPR and the U.K. GDPR impose more\nstringent data protection requirements and provide greater penalties for noncompliance than previous data\nprotection laws. Companies that violate the GDPR can face private litigation, restrictions on data processing, and\nfines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of their worldwide annual revenue. Our or our customers’,\npartners’, or vendors’ failure to comply with the GDPR could lead to significant fines imposed by regulators or\nrestrictions on our ability to process personal information as needed to provide our product and services. We may\nalso be obligated to assist our customers, partners, and vendors with their own compliance obligations under the\nGDPR, which could require expenditure of significant resources.\nCertain jurisdictions have enacted data localization laws and cross-border data transfer laws. For example, absent\nappropriate safeguards or other circumstances, the GDPR generally restricts the transfer of personal information to\ncountries outside of the EEA, such as the United States, which the European Commission does not consider to provide\nan adequate level of data privacy and security. The European Commission released a set of Standard Contractual\nClauses that are designed to be a lawful mechanism by which entities can transfer personal information out of the\nEEA to jurisdictions that the European Commission has not found to provide an adequate level of protection. The\nStandard Contractual Clauses require parties that rely upon them to comply with additional obligations, such as\nconducting transfer impact assessments to determine whether additional security measures are necessary to protect\nthe at-issue personal information. Moreover, due to potential legal challenges, there exists some uncertainty\nregarding whether the Standard Contractual Clauses will remain a valid mechanism for transfers of personal\ninformation out of the EEA. In addition, laws in Switzerland and the U.K. similarly restrict transfers of personal\ninformation outside of those jurisdictions to countries such as the United States that do not provide an adequate\nlevel of personal information protection.\nIn addition to European restrictions on cross-border transfers of personal information, other jurisdictions have\nenacted or are considering similar cross-border personal information transfer laws and local personal information\nresidency laws, any of which could increase the cost and complexity of doing business. If we cannot implement a\nvalid compliance mechanism for cross-border transfers, we may face increased exposure to regulatory actions,\nsubstantial fines, and injunctions against processing or transferring personal information from Europe or\nelsewhere. The inability to import personal information to the United States could significantly and negatively\nimpact our business operations; limiting our ability to collaborate with parties that are subject to European and\nother privacy, data protection, and information security laws; or requiring us to increase our personal information\nprocessing capabilities in Europe and/or elsewhere at significant expense.\nWe are also subject to evolving EU and U.K. privacy laws on cookies and e-marketing. European regulators are\nincreasingly focusing on compliance with requirements in the online behavioral advertising ecosystem, and current\nnational laws that implement the ePrivacy Directive are likely to be replaced by the ePrivacy Regulation, which\ncould lead to substantial costs, limit the effectiveness of our marketing and personalization activities, and\nsubject us to additional liabilities.\nStates have also begun to introduce more comprehensive privacy legislation. For example, the California Consumer\nPrivacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, affords consumers expanded privacy\nprotections. The CCPA allows for statutory fines for noncompliance (up to $7,500 per violation). The CCPA will be\nexpanded substantially on January 1, 2023 when the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (the “CPRA”), which was\napproved by California voters in November 2020, becomes fully operative. Aspects of the CCPA and CPRA, and their\ninterpretation and enforcement remain uncertain. The potential effects of the CCPA and CPRA are far-reaching and\nmay require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and to incur substantial costs and expenses in\nan effort to comply.\nThe CCPA appears to mark the beginning of a trend toward more stringent privacy legislation in the United States,\nas other states have followed California’s lead and increase protections for their residents. The CCPA has already\nprompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our\npotential liability, increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business. In addition, effective\nOctober 1, 2019, Nevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”) to now require, among\nother things, that businesses provide an online mechanism or toll-free phone number to intake requests from\nconsumers to opt out of the sale of their personal information. Virginia and Colorado have similarly enacted\ncomprehensive privacy laws, the Consumer Data Protection Act and Colorado Privacy Act, respectively, both laws of\nwhich emulate the CCPA and CPRA in many respects. The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act takes effect on January\n1, 2023, and the Colorado Privacy Act takes effect on July 1, 2023.\nThe Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) is a U.S. Federal law that applies to operators of\ncommercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect personal\ninformation from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they are\ncollecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications services to\nschools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid classrooms, distance\nlearning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these services, Zoom may be used\nby students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect\n30\nTable of Contents\npersonal information from such students on behalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually\nconsent to Zoom’s information practices on behalf of students, prior to students using the services. In addition,\nthe GDPR prohibits certain processing of the personal information of children under the age of 13-16 (depending on\nthe country) without parental consent. If we fail to accurately anticipate the application, interpretation, or\nlegislative expansion of COPPA, HIPAA, GDPR, and CCPA, we could be subject to governmental enforcement actions,\ndata processing restrictions, litigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as\na result of any such failures, we could be in breach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could\nlose trust in us, which could harm our reputation and business.\nWith laws and regulations, such as the GDPR and UK GDPR in the EU as well as the CCPA, SPI Law, HIPAA, and COPPA in\nthe United States imposing relatively burdensome obligations, and with substantial uncertainty over the\ninterpretation and application of these and other laws and regulations, we have faced and may face additional\nchallenges in addressing their requirements and making necessary changes to our policies and practices. Additional\nuses of our services arising out of increased demand associated with the COVID-19 pandemic may require us to\naddress additional privacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and\ncontractual obligations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nWe were also the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations and\npractices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January 19,\n2021. We could fail or be perceived to fail to comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other\norders or settlements relating to litigation or governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and\nsecurity practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such orders or settlements may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens\nimposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other obligations that are applicable to the businesses of our\nusers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our services and\nfeatures, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability to store and\nprocess user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas led to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage,\ndisclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and\ncustomers, particularly those that are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their\nown IT controls like those of a larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with\ncontrol over user settings. This has resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by\nmalicious actors. Additional unfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny and litigation exposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence, additional expenses and other harm to our business.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially\ninterfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries. For example, while we stopped selling our\nproducts directly in China during the six months ended July 31, 2020, the prior U.S. administration had threatened\ntougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or announcement of future\nimposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $500 billion of imports from China. In\nresponse, China imposed and proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S.\n31\nTable of Contents\nproducts. The direct and indirect effects of tariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure\nand are only one part of a larger U.S./China economic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are\nuncertain because of the dynamic nature of governmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or\nworsening of, current global economic conditions and further escalation of trade tensions between the United States\nand its trading partners, especially China, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to\nglobal trade, including retaliatory trade restrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot\npredict what actions may ultimately be taken by the new U.S. administration with respect to tariffs or trade\nrelations between the United States and China or other countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or\nwhat actions may be taken by the other countries in retaliation. Any further deterioration in the relations between\nthe United States and China could exacerbate these actions and other governmental intervention. For example, the\nimplementation of China’s national-security law in Hong Kong has created additional U.S.-China tensions and could\npotentially increase the risks associated with the business and operations of U.S.-based technology companies in\nChina. Any alterations to our business strategy or operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such\nchanges would be time-consuming and expensive, and certain of our competitors may be better suited to withstand or\nreact to these changes.\nFurther, in recent years, the U.S. Government has expressed concerns with the security of information and\ncommunications technology and services (“ICTS”) sourced from providers in China, Russia, and other jurisdictions.\nIn May 2019, former President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to\nimplement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of ICTS in transactions that imposed undue national\nsecurity risks. The executive order is subject to implementation by the Secretary of Commerce and applies to\ncontracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. On March 22, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce\nissued an interim final rule allowing it to identify, review, and prohibit ICTS transactions that pose a national\nsecurity risk, including transactions involving specified countries, such as China. Several aspects of this rule\nremain unclear including the scope of affected transactions and how the rule will be implemented and enforced in\npractice. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement\nfurther restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. Due to the uncertainty\nregarding the timing, content, and extent of any such changes in policy, we cannot assure you that we will\nsuccessfully mitigate any negative impact. Depending upon their duration and implementation, these tariffs, the\nexecutive order and its implementation, and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business,\nincluding in the form of increased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced\nsales.\nWe may be subject to additional liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. State and local taxing authorities have differing rules and regulations which are\nsubject to varying interpretations. This makes the applicability of sales tax to e-commerce businesses, such as\nours, uncertain and complex. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, additional\ntaxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical\npresence or “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales\nof our platform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus\nfor sales made over the Internet and, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, states may\nrequire an e-commerce business with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax. Therefore, it\nis possible that we could face future audits or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities and that our\nliability for these taxes could exceed our estimates. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in\nthe U.S. or internationally, could harm our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our hosts’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in potential violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently\nmade our software products available to some customers in potential violation of the EAR. As a result, we have\nsubmitted and from time to time\n32\nTable of Contents\nwill continue to submit as warranted initial and final voluntary self-disclosures regarding compliance with U.S.\nsanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry\nand Security (“BIS”). For instance, in June 2021, we submitted an initial voluntary self-disclosure to BIS\nregarding compliance with certain U.S. export control laws and regulations.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result\nin fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, business disruption,\nreputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working to implement additional\ncontrols designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully\neffective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or\nin our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international\noperations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nlikely harm our business.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a variety of U.S. and international laws that\ncould result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws,\nchanges in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with\nthe laws.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, various laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive, and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to ensure user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent, or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. We also recently created an in-product security feature that allows the\nhost or co-host of a meeting to easily select a meeting participant that may be engaging in illegal or harmful\nbehavior and send a report about that behavior to our trust and safety team for evaluation. Our trust and safety\nteam may take further action as appropriate, including suspension or termination of the participant's account or\nreferral to law enforcement. While to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative actions as\na result of improper or illegal content, the laws in this area are currently in a state of flux and vary widely\nbetween jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that in the future we and our competitors may be subject to\nlegal actions along with the users who shared such content. In addition, regardless of any legal liability we may\nface, our reputation could be harmed should there be an incident generating extensive negative publicity about the\ncontent shared on our platform. Such publicity would harm our business.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers and hosts. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future\nbecome the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,\nincluding our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or\napplied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur\nfines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\nOur platform depends on the ability of our customers, hosts, and users to access the internet, and our platform has\nbeen blocked or restricted in some countries for various reasons. If we fail to anticipate developments in the law,\nor fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be further blocked or restricted, and we\ncould be exposed to significant liability that could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, as amended (the \"FCPA\"), and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-\nbribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their\nemployees and intermediaries, from directly or indirectly authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or\nbenefits to government officials and other recipients for improper purposes. The FCPA also requires public\ncompanies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation\nand to device and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we take precautions to\nprevent violations of anti-corruption laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as we continue to\nexpand our international presence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\n33\nTable of Contents\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (\"VoIP\") service provider. [As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access.] Congress or the FCC may expand the scope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time.\nIn addition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service could result in\nadditional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with any current or future state\nregulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to\nrestructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could\nultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public\nprocess, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers\nand harm our business.\nChanges in FCC regulation of the internet and internet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations\non our other services. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that three issues remanded by the\nU.S. Court of Appeals following the appeal of its 2018 decision to eliminate its network neutrality rules did not\nprovide a basis to alter its conclusions in that order. Petitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending.\nDemocratic control of the Executive Branch, Congress, and the FCC following the 2020 elections increases the\nlikelihood of legislative or FCC action to reverse the 2018 decision or adopt new network neutrality rules. Such\naction could result in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications services like the\nones we offer. The imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could be required to\nmodify our service offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such regulation\ncould result in substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. President Biden and many\nMembers of Congress from both parties support reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of Congressional\naction remains. In addition, the FCC is considering a petition, filed by the Trump Administration, to adopt rules\ninterpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that is\ntransmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of offensive content. No date has been set for a vote\non that proposal and the FCC has not released any document describing the rules that would be proposed. The\nDemocratic members of the FCC have indicated that they are opposed to the petition and now control the agenda of\nthe FCC. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition. If Congress revises or repeals Section 230 or\nthe FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same level of protection offered by Section 230. In\naddition, there are pending cases before the judiciary that may result in changes to the protections afforded to\ninternet platforms, including a lawsuit by former President Trump that, if successful, would greatly limit the\nscope of Section 230. These various efforts to limit the protections provided by Section 230 would increase the\nrisks faced by internet-based businesses, like Zoom, that rely on third-party content. Even if claims asserted\nagainst us do not result in liability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims.\nIf we are found liable for our customers’ or other users’ activities, we could be required to pay fines or\npenalties, redesign business methods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and\nto avoid future liability.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer and the California Public Utilities Commission is now taking the position\nthat it can require VoIP providers like Zoom Phone to obtain authority to operate in that state. We generally pass\nUSF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in\nour products becoming more expensive. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts\nto apply state telecommunications regulations to services like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or\nfuture state regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may\nhave to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nA federal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network\nneutrality law, and as a result, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. Trade associations\nrepresenting internet service\n34\nTable of Contents\nproviders appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary injunction, and the appeal was denied on\nJanuary 28, 2022. This decision could be appealed to the full court of appeals or the Supreme Court, or the parties\ncould return to the trial court for further proceedings to determine whether a permanent injunction should be\ngranted. We cannot predict whether other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.\nLegislation has been adopted in Florida and Texas and has been introduced in at least fifteen additional states\nthat is intended to reduce or eliminate the power of businesses operating on the Internet to moderate user-\ngenerated content, implicitly eliminating the federal protections granted under Section 230. In response to\nchallenges from industry groups, federal courts have enjoined enforcement of the Florida and Texas laws, but\nappeals are pending in both cases. It is likely that any other such state legislation also would be challenged\nunder the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and on the ground that it is preempted by Section 230. We cannot\npredict whether any such state legislation will be adopted, enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other rights. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large\nnumbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we face\nincreasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights\nclaims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may\nfrom time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property,\nour business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we\nhave valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and time consuming, divert the attention of our\nmanagement and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our\nservices, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be no assurances\nthat favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are\nunfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The\nterms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions\nfor indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights,\nwhich could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may\nmake announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities\nanalysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue\npractices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may\nsignificantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at\nall, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the\npractices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort\nand expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret and\ndomain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make\nbusiness decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright\nor trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where\nwe seek patent protection, there is no assurance that the resulting patents will effectively protect every\nsignificant feature of our products. In addition, we believe that the protection of our trademark rights is an\nimportant factor in product recognition, protecting our brand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately\nprotect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and unauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in\nthose trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could harm our brand and our business. Third parties may\nknowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights; third parties may challenge our proprietary right;\npending and future\n35\nTable of Contents\npatent, trademark, and copyright applications may not be approved; and we may not be able to prevent infringement\nwithout incurring substantial expense. We have also devoted substantial resources to the development of our\nproprietary technologies and related processes. In order to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we\nrely in part on trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third\nparties. These agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an\nadequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may\nindependently discover our trade secrets, in which case we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or\ndevelop similar technologies and processes. Further, the laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same\nlevel of protection of corporate proprietary information and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks,\ntrade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws of the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain\ncountries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other\nintellectual property protection. As a result, we may encounter significant problems in protecting and defending\nour intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad. Additionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of\ntheft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our proprietary information and other intellectual property, including\ntechnical data, manufacturing processes, data sets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our\nintellectual property rights in such foreign countries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial\nadvantage from the intellectual property that we develop, which could have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary\nto enforce and determine the scope of our proprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is\ninadequate to prevent use or appropriation by third parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible\nassets may be diminished, and competitors may be able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features.\nAny of these events would harm our business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software in our technologies. Open\nsource software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. From time\nto time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open\nsource software and requesting compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-\ncompliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users\nwho use, distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\noffer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source software for no cost. We may also be required to\nmake publicly available source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code) for\nmodifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software and/or to\nlicense such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally,\nif a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such\nprovider, we could be required to disclose any of our source code that incorporates or is a modification of our\nlicensed software. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open\nsource software and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source\nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims\nof intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an\nincreasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law\nto provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the\nterms of any of these open source licenses, we may be required to publicly release certain portions of our\nproprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some of\nour software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in connection\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced an increase in the usage of our unified communications platform,\nand as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock has significantly increased, while at the same time,\nthe broader market has experienced significant declines and volatility. There are no assurances that the trading\nprice of our Class A common stock will\n36\nTable of Contents\ncontinue at this level for any period of time. Moreover, the trading price of our Class A common stock could\nexperience a significant decrease once the scope and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is better understood. These\nfluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our Class A common stock. Factors that could\ncause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock include the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April 2020, June 2020, July 2020, and October 2021, we and certain of our officers and\ndirectors were sued in putative class action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging\nviolations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our\ndata privacy and security measures. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert\nour management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. We may be the\ntarget of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January\n31, 2022, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 67.8% of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding\n60.8% of such voting power in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2022, our founder, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Eric S. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 7.6% of our outstanding capital stock but\ncontrolled approximately 29.8% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have\nsignificant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\nincluding election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of Zoom or\nour assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of Class B common stock will be automatically converted into one\nshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that is six months following the death or\nincapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing\nservices to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date specified by the holders of a majority of\nthe then\n37\nTable of Contents\noutstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate class, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary of the\nclosing of our IPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate\nmatters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nIn addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly\npublic companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected\nindices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the\nS&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us ineligible for\ninclusion in any of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment\nvehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies may\ndepress the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from the indices or depress our trading volume\ncompared to those of other similar companies that are included.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\n38\nTable of Contents\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable\n39\nTable of Contents\nfuture. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation as the\nonly way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using legacy communication\nmethods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product feature that every\ncustomer or host wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform does not provide. The\nvariables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time, and there is no\nguarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market opportunity estimates\nwill purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even if the markets in which\nwe compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow for a variety of reasons\noutside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks materializes, it could harm\nour business and prospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted virtually every\ncountry in the world. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health developments could have an\nadverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could include business and service\ndisruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our employees' ability to travel to\nsupport our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees. We have removed the 40-minute time\nlimit from our free Basic accounts for customers in K-12 schools in certain countries. While we have seen increased\nusage of our service globally, a significant portion of such increase is attributable to free Basic accounts, which\ndo not generate any revenue. We cannot make any assurances that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or\nthat new or existing users will continue to utilize our services at the same levels after the COVID-19 pandemic has\ntapered. Furthermore, such increased usage by free Basic account users during this time has required and will\ncontinue to require us to expand our network capacity which will increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested\ncapital. Significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nWe have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies. The financial success of our\ninvestments in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment.\nLikewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an exit\nin favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public\nofferings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have\ninvested in could significantly worsen. In addition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex\ndue to the lack of readily available market data.\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held non-marketable securities through\nthe consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of\noperations due to changes in market prices of our investments in publicly held securities and the valuation and\ntiming of observable price changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. Our ability to\nmitigate this volatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for\na set period of time. All of our investments are subject to a risk of\n40\nTable of Contents\na partial or total loss of investment capital. Changes in the fair value or partial or total loss of investment\ncapital of these individual companies could be material to our financial statements and negatively impact our\nbusiness and financial results.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of\nequity or equity-linked or debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to\nthe rights of our Class A common stock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to\nexpend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of our consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and\nmaintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic\nmanagement evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in\nour periodic reports that will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure\n41\nTable of Contents\ncontrols and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence\nin our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of\nour Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able\nto remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We are required to provide an annual management report on the\neffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.",

          "content": "Item 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur mission is to make video communications frictionless and secure.\nZoom enables users to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their\nimagination. Our frictionless communications platform started with video as its foundation, and we have set the\nstandard for innovation ever since. We connect people through our core unified communications offering, which\nfrictionlessly brings together video, phone, chat, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences across\ndisparate devices and locations. Our Developer Platform enables customers, developers, and service providers to\neasily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-leading video communications platform, with\nopportunities for global discovery and distribution. Our virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to\nseamlessly create and manage engaging events. We believe that face-to-face communications build greater empathy and\ntrust. We strive to live up to the trust our customers place in us by delivering a communications solution while\nprioritizing their privacy and security. Our 24 co-located data centers worldwide and the public cloud enable us to\nprovide both high-quality and high-definition, real-time video to our customers even in low-bandwidth environments.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our unified communications platform. Subscription revenue is\ndriven primarily by the number of paid hosts as well as purchases of additional products, including Zoom Rooms,\nZoom Webinars, Zoom Phone, Zoom Events, and Hardware-as-a-Service (“HaaS”) for rooms and phones. A host is any user\nof our unified communications platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to join\nthat meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.” We define a customer as\na separate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid user or host or an organization of any size\n(including a distinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. Our Basic offering is free and gives\nhosts access to Zoom Meetings with core features but with the limitation that meetings with more than two endpoints\ntime-out at 40 minutes. Our paid offerings include our Pro, Business, Enterprise, Education, and Healthcare plans,\nwhich provide incremental features and functionality, such as different participant limits, administrative\ncontrols, and reporting.\nFor Zoom Phone, plans include Zoom Phone Pro, which provides extension-to-extension calling or can be used with the\nBring Your Own Carrier model wherein the customer connects Zoom Phone to an existing carrier. We also offer\nRegional Unlimited and Regional Metered calling plans in three specific markets (United States/Canada, United\nKingdom/Ireland, and Australia/New Zealand). In addition, we introduced the Global Select plan in August 2020,\nwhich allows customers to select from local numbers and domestic calling in more than 45 countries and territories\nwhere Zoom has local public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) coverage. In addition, the Zoom United plan\nlaunched in December 2020 provides a single license for customers to purchase Zoom Phone, Meetings and chat\ncapabilities as a bundled offering.\nOur revenue was $4,099.9 million, $2,651.4 million, and $622.7 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022,\n2021, and 2020, respectively, representing period-over-period growth rate of 55% and 326% for fiscal year 2022 and\nfiscal year 2021, respectively. We had net income of $1,375.6 million, $672.3 million, and $25.3 million for the\nfiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities was\n$1,605.3 million, $1,471.2 million, and $151.9 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively.\n44\nTable of Contents\nImpact of the COVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, affecting many countries around the\nworld. Governments have instituted lockdown or other similar measures to slow infection rates. Many organizations\nhave resorted to mandating employees to work from home, which has resulted in these organizations seeking out video\ncommunication solutions like ours to keep employees as productive as possible, even while working from home.\nSchools, colleges, and universities globally have also closed as a result of this pandemic. Many of these\ninstitutions are utilizing our platform to provide remote instruction to their students. To help teachers and\nstudents navigate this unprecedented situation, we have temporarily removed the 40-minute time limit for meetings\nwith more than two endpoints from our free Basic accounts for more than 125,000 K-12 domains worldwide.\nWhile we have experienced a significant increase in paid hosts and revenue due to the pandemic, the aforementioned\nfactors have also driven increased usage of our services and have required us to expand our network, data storage,\nand processing capacity, both in our own co-located data centers as well as through third-party cloud hosting,\nwhich has resulted, and is continuing to result, in an increase in our operating costs. Furthermore, a significant\nportion of the increase in usage of our platform is attributable to free Basic accounts and our removal of the time\nlimit for school domains, which do not generate any revenue, but still require us to incur these additional\noperating costs to expand our capacity. Therefore, the recent increase in usage of our platform has adversely\naffected, and may continue to adversely affect, our gross margin.\nIn addition, there is no assurance that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or that new or existing users\nwill continue to utilize our service after the COVID-19 pandemic has tapered globally. Moreover, the tapering of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, particularly as vaccines become widely available and distributed, may result in a decline in\npaid hosts and users once individuals are no longer working or attending school from home.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and\ngrowth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe there is a\nsignificant market opportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or\nthe future growth rate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and\nmarketing in order to address this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented sales personnel who\nare able to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers have\nincreased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across their operations.\nSome of our larger customers start with a deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location, or geography, before\nrolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our largest customers have deployed our platform\nglobally to their entire workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in the use of our platform\nalso provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our customers, such as Zoom Phone,\nZoom HaaS, Zoom for Home, Zoom Rooms at each office location, Developer Platform solutions, Zoom Events, and Zoom\nVideo Webinars. In order for us to address this opportunity to expand the use of our products with our existing\ncustomers, we will need to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new features and functionality that\nare responsive to our customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing customers through our net dollar expansion rate. Our net dollar expansion\nrate includes the increase in user adoption within our customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven\nby the number of paid hosts within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our\nsubscription revenue from the same set of customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion\nrate as of a period end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all customers with more than 10\nemployees as of 12 months prior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of\nsubscription agreements from all customers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring\nrevenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it by 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription\nagreements from all customers for the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers who have\nnot provided any indication that they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from these\ncustomers as of the current period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contraction, and\nattrition. We divide the Current Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For\nthe trailing 12-months calculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12\nmonths. Our net dollar expansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of\npenetration within our customer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our customers.\nOur trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for customers with more\n45\nTable of Contents\nthan 10 employees was 129% as of January 31, 2022 and greater than 130% as of January 31, 2021 and 2020. The\ntrailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees was under 130% as of January\n31, 2022 as the denominator of this trailing 12-month metric reflects the significant growth in our customer base\nduring the last two years.\nAs our business has changed and evolved, we have expansively built out our direct sales team, resellers, and\nstrategic partners. We expect that revenue from customers engaged through these channels, which we call Enterprise\ncustomers, will constitute an increasingly higher percentage of our revenue over time, and therefore we believe our\nperformance with Enterprise customers is a more important factor affecting our business than our performance with\nexisting customers with more than 10 employees. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, we will no\nlonger present the trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees. However,\nwe will still provide this metric through the end of fiscal year 2023 in the appendix to the investor deck that we\nwill continue to post on our investor relations website each quarter at investors.zoom.us. Going forward, we will\ninstead provide the trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Enterprise Customers\nOur net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers is calculated the same way as discussed above by applying\nthe ARR specifically from Enterprise customers. We define Enterprise customers as distinct business units who have\nbeen engaged by either our direct sales team, resellers, or strategic partners. We assess our performance with\nEnterprise customers by measuring our net dollar expansion rate. Our net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise\ncustomers measures our ability to increase revenue across our existing Enterprise customer base through expansion\nof users and products. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers was 130% as of\nJanuary 31, 2022, and greater than 130% as of January 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, we have recently\nintroduced a number of product enhancements, including new features for Zoom Phone, Zoom Meetings, and Zoom\nWebinars. We addressed new work-from-home realities with the introduction of Zoom for Home, a solution designed for\nthe home office that combines Zoom software enhancements with compatible hardware. We also expanded our geographic\nfootprint with Zoom Phone availability to more than 45 countries and territories during fiscal year 2022. Third-\nparty developers are also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it easier for customers\nand developers to extend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as more developers and\nother third parties use our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will become the ubiquitous\nplatform for communications. We will need to expend additional resources to continue introducing new products,\nfeatures, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the value of our platform with\ntheir own applications.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 200 participants. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures Zoom meetings by\ndefault, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to\ndistribute these keys to the other meeting participants.\nIn July 2021, we introduced Zoom Events. Zoom Events provides businesses with a virtual event management solution\nand enables users to manage and host all types of internal and external virtual events. This includes the ability\nto create a “hub” where all of a business’ events can be listed with corresponding information about each\nexperience. It also enables event hosts to provide ticketing and registration for attendees, and the ability to\ntrack these activities.\nInternational Expansion\nOur platform addresses the communications needs of users worldwide, and we see international expansion as a major\nopportunity. Our revenue from the rest of world (APAC and EMEA) represented 33%, 31%, and 19% of our total revenue\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. We plan to add local sales support in\nfurther select international markets over time. We use strategic partners and resellers to sell in certain\ninternational markets where we have limited or no direct sales presence. While we believe global demand for our\nplatform will continue to increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our\noperations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.\n46\nTable of Contents\nKey Business Metrics\nWe have historically reviewed the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends,\nformulate financial projections, and make strategic decisions.\nCustomers with More Than 10 Employees\nIncreasing awareness of our platform and its broad range of capabilities has enabled us to substantially expand our\ncustomer base, which includes organizations of all sizes across industries. We define a customer as a separate and\ndistinct buying entity, which can be a single paid host or an organization of any size (including a distinct unit\nof an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. To better distinguish business customers from our broader\ncustomer base, we review the number of customers with more than 10 employees. As of January 31, 2022, 2021, and\n2020, we had approximately 509,800, 467,100, and 81,900 customers, respectively, with more than 10 employees. When\ndisclosing the number of customers, we round down to the nearest hundred.\nAs we approach our three-year anniversary as a public company, our business has evolved substantially and the\nmetrics that management uses to evaluate the business have changed. Beginning with the first quarter of fiscal year\n2023, we will no longer present the number of customers with more than 10 employees. However, we will still provide\nthis metric through the end of fiscal year 2023 in the appendix to the investor deck that we will continue to post\non our investor relations website each quarter at investors.zoom.us.\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as it\nis a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from\nthese customers represented 22%, 20%, and 33% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021,\nand 2020, respectively. As of January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had 2,725, 1,644, and 641 customers,\nrespectively, that contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our rapid\npenetration of larger organizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of the customers with more\nthan 10 employees.\nNumber of Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that our ability to increase the number of Enterprise customers is an indicator of our potential future\nbusiness opportunities, the growth of our business, and an indicator of our market penetration. Increasing\nawareness of our platform and capabilities, coupled with the mainstream adoption of our technology, has expanded\nthe diversity of our customer base to include organizations of all sizes across all industries. Over time, we\nexpect Enterprise customers to represent a larger share of our business. As of January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we\nhad approximately 191,000, 141,100, and 54,600 Enterprise customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”) and adjusted\nfree cash flow (“Adjusted FCF”), non-GAAP financial measures, are useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We define\nAdjusted FCF as FCF plus litigation settlement payments, net. We add back litigation settlement payments, net\nbecause they are not part of our ongoing operating activities, and the consideration of measures that exclude such\npayments can assist in the comparison of cash generated from operations in different periods which may or may not\ninclude such payments and assist in the comparison with the results of other companies in the industry. We believe\nthat FCF and Adjusted FCF are useful indicators of liquidity that provides information to management and investors\nabout the amount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be\nused for future growth. FCF and Adjusted FCF are presented for supplemental informational purposes only, have\nlimitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of\nother GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that\nother companies, including companies in our industry, may not use these metrics, may calculate these metrics\ndifferently, or may use other financial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the\nusefulness of these non-GAAP metrics as a comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nand Adjusted FCF to net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure\ncalculated in accordance with GAAP:\n47\nTable of Contents\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022             2021           2020\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating              $               1,605,266    $   1,471,177    $   151,892\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                              -132,590          -79,972        -38,084\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                   $               1,472,676    $   1,391,205    $   113,808\nAdd: Litigation settlement payments, net                       85,000                —              —\nAdjusted free cash flow (non-GAAP)          $               1,557,676    $   1,391,205    $   113,808\nNet cash used in investing activities       $              -2,859,097    $  -1,562,420    $  -499,468\nNet cash provided by financing              $                  34,068    $   2,050,277    $   615,690\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications\nplatform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also provide\nservices, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are generally\nconsidered distinct from the access to our unified communications platform.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing\ngeneral operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-located data centers, third-\nparty cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of capitalized\nsoftware development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead. We expect our cost\nof revenue to increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future, as we expand our data center capacity due to\nincreased usage over time. However, the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue may decrease over time as we\nscale our data centers to accommodate usage from our increased customer base and as the ratio of free to paid users\nvaries.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. We plan to increase our investment in research\nand development for the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing research and development headcount, as we focus\non further developing our platform, enhancing its use cases, and strengthening security and privacy. As a result,\nwe expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars during the upcoming fiscal year. We\nexpect, however, that our research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain relatively flat\nduring the upcoming fiscal year.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include credit card processing fees related to\nsales and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs. We plan to increase our investment in sales and\nmarketing over the foreseeable future, primarily by increasing the headcount of our direct sales force and\nmarketing investments in demand generation. As a result, we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in\nabsolute dollars during the upcoming fiscal year. We expect, however, that our sales and marketing expenses as a\npercentage of revenue will remain relatively flat during the upcoming fiscal year.\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance and\nlegal organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services; expected\ncredit losses; insurance; indirect taxes; litigation settlements, and allocated overhead. We expect to increase the\nsize of our general and administrative function to support the growth and complexity of our business. As a result,\nwe expect our general and\n48\nTable of Contents\nadministrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars during the upcoming fiscal year. We expect, however, that\nour general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue will remain relatively flat during the upcoming\nfiscal year.\nGains on Strategic Investments, Net\nGains on strategic investments, net consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses on our equity investments.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nOther (expense) income, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion on our marketable securities\nand effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n(Benefit from) provision for Income Taxes\n(Benefit from) provision for income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign\njurisdictions where we conduct business.\n49\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth

The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase of $99.0 million in personnel-related expenses\nmainly driven by additional headcount, which includes a $34.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense;\nan increase of $26.6 million related to subscription to software-based services; an increase of $9.3 million in\nallocated overhead expenses; and an increase of $8.6 million in professional services mainly for customer support.\nGross margin increased to 74% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 from 69% for the fiscal year ended January\n31, 2021. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to increased efficiencies as we expanded our data center\ncapacity to accommodate the increased usage as well as lower rates from third-party cloud hosting providers.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022          2021       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nResearch and development    $                            362,990    $  164,080    $   198,910         121  %\nResearch and development expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 increased by $198.9 million, or 121%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.

The change in income taxes was primarily\ndue to the valuation allowance release on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets. See Note 10 “Income\nTaxes” to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more details on\nthe valuation allowance release.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020,\nplease refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2022, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $5.4 billion, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the effects of\nthe COVID-19 pandemic, including timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks detailed in the\nsection titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects, we believe our\nexisting cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by operations, will be\nsufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to capitalize on growth opportunities. We\nbelieve we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through a combination of cash\nflows from operating activities and available cash balances. Our future capital requirements will depend on many\nfactors, including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency, the timing and extent\nof spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, as well as expenses\nassociated with our international expansion, and the timing and extent of additional capital expenditures to invest\nin existing and new office spaces as well as data center infrastructure. We may, in the future, enter into\narrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies, including intellectual\nproperty rights. We may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing. In the event that\nadditional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or\nat all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of operations, and\nfinancial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our leases for\noffice space and equipment, as well as non-cancelable purchase obligations. Expected timing of those payments are\nas follows:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $         117,763    $                 24,490    $   47,787    $  30,171    $     15,315\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         386,594                     227,182       159,412            —               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         504,357    $                251,672    $  207,199    $  30,171    $     15,315\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding.

Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted\nfor certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as\nwell as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,605.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, compared\nto $1,471.2 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021. The increase in operating cash flow was due to an\nincrease in net income of $703.3 million, offset by the negative impact from changes in operating assets and\nliabilities of $506.3 million, and a decrease in non-cash adjustments of $62.9 million, which is primarily a result\nof the income tax benefit from release of valuation allowance and higher gains from strategic investments, offset\nby higher stock-based compensation expense, higher deferred contract acquisition cost amortization due to an\nincrease in capitalized commissions as we continue to grow and expand our customer base, and higher provision for\naccounts receivable allowances due to higher accounts receivable balances.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $2,859.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $2,404.8 million, purchases of strategic investments of $305.1\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $132.6 million, purchases of intangible assets of $13.0 million,\nand cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $3.5 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $1,562.4 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $1,438.8 million, purchases of property and equipment of $80.0\nmillion, cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $26.5 million, purchases of strategic investments of\n$13.0 million, and purchases of intangible assets of $5.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $34.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was due to\nproceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $59.3 million and\nproceeds from the exercise of stock options of $14.4 million, offset by proceeds from international employee stock\nsales remitted to employees and tax authorities of $40.0 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $2,050.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 was due to\nproceeds from our follow-on offering, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs, of\n$1,979.2 million , proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our ESPP of $38.4 million, proceeds from the\nexercise of stock options of $28.6 million, and proceeds from international employee stock sales to be remitted to\nemployees and tax authorities of $4.1 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 , please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2021.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2022, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of our Class A\ncommon, which expires in February 2024. Repurchases of our Class A common stock may be effected from time to time,\neither on the open market (including pre-set trading plans), in privately negotiated transactions, and other\ntransactions in accordance with applicable securities laws.\n54\nTable of Contents\nThe timing and the amount of any repurchased Class A common stock will be determined by our management based on its\nevaluation of market conditions and other factors, and the repurchase program will be funded using our working\ncapital. T he program may be modified, suspended or discontinued at any time.\nAs of March 6, 2022, $997.1 million of the repurchase authorization remained available.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by\nthe SEC under the Securities Act.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates that require the most difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the\nnature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly\nuncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial\ncondition or operating performance is material.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and\nSignificant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following critical estimates involve\na greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional services,\nconsulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. We apply judgment during the\nidentification of a contract to determine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of\nfactors, including the customer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and\nfinancial information pertaining to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to\nwhich we expect to be entitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is\nincluded in the transaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of\ncumulative revenue recognized under the contract will not occur.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nSignificant judgment is required in arriving at this estimated period of benefit. We determine the period of\nbenefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the\ninitial estimated customer life and the technological life of our unified communications platform and related\nsignificant features. We do not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a\nstraight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nThe allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for expected credit losses for outstanding\naccounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical write-off experience, an analysis of\nthe aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the establishment of specific reserves for\ncustomers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our expectations of changes in macroeconomic\nconditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables, including noncurrent accounts receivable.\nWe also consider current market conditions and reasonable\n55\nTable of Contents\nand supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess\nthe adequacy of the allowance for credit losses each reporting period.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2022, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or\nchanges in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have\nnot recorded any impairment charges during the fiscal years presented.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan Valuation\nWe account for stock-based compensation expense related to our ESPP purchase rights based on the estimated grant\ndate fair value, which is calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the aggregate number of\nshares of our common stock expected to be purchased under each offering. The assumptions used to determine the fair\nvalue of the ESPP purchase rights, including the expected term of the awards, the expected volatility of the price\nof our common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock, represent\nmanagement’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s\njudgment. The related stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of each\nESPP offering period, which is generally two years. We account for modifications to employee contributions as they\noccur.\nOur use of the Black-Scholes option-pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions. If factors change\nand different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different for the\ncurrent period and in the future.\nThese assumptions and estimates used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model are as follows:\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the awards was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of the ESPP represents the period of time that purchase rights are expected to\nbe outstanding.\nExpected Volatility. For the ESPP purchase rights granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021, as we\nhave a limited trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was estimated by taking the average\nhistoric price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public companies in our industry which are\neither similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period equivalent to the expected term\nof the awards. For the ESPP purchase rights granted during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, expected\nvolatility was determined using a combination of the implied volatility of publicly traded options in our stock and\nhistorical volatility of our stock price.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\n56\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Investments\nAccounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a\ncontrolling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily\navailable market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs\nor data in an inactive market. The valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent\nlack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our\nstrategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to\nreflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.\nWe assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for indicators for\nimpairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative assessment evaluates key factors including but not\nlimited to the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which\nthe investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair\nvalue by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying\nvalue for the investment.\nThe privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other\nsecurities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation\nto movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company\nmay move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent\nin enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2022 would not have had\na material impact on the value of our investment portfolio.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is\nrecognized based on the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and\nassets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements\nor tax returns. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current income tax provision\n(benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against a deferred tax asset. The\nassumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current income tax provision (benefit) take into account\ncurrent tax laws, their interpretation and possible results of foreign and domestic tax audits. Changes in tax law,\ntheir interpretation and resolution of tax audits could significantly impact the income taxes provided in our\nconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income\ntaxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and\nchanges to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.",

QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe vast majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a small amount\ndenominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the jurisdictions in\nwhich we conduct our operations, which are primarily in the United States, China, Europe, and Australia. Our\nresults of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in\nforeign currency exchange rates. The effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates\napplicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has\nnot been material to our historical operating results, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions,\nbut we may do so in the future if our exposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and marketable securities of $4.4 billion as of January 31, 2022.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds, high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our\n57\nTable of Contents\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and other debt\nsecurities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate\nrisk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing income without\nsignificantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not\nused any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-term nature\nof our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to\nchanges in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented would\nnot have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\n58\nTable of Contents",

We also have audited the Company’s\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n60\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $4,099\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2022.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts. Additionally, for the same sample\nof transactions, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the\narrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying performance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the\nsufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

Policies\nDescription of Business\nZoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zoom,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)\nconnect people through our core unified communications offering, which frictionlessly brings together video, phone,\nchat, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences across disparate devices and locations. We were incorporated\nin the state of Delaware in April 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose, California.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2022, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2022.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Video\nCommunications, Inc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, the useful lives of\nlong-lived assets, the incremental borrowing rate for operating leases, stock-based compensation expense, sales and\nother tax liabilities, the fair value of marketable securities, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the\nvaluation of deferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions, and accruals and contingencies. Actual results\ncould materially differ from those estimates.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created, and may continue to create, significant uncertainty in macroeconomic conditions,\nand the extent of its impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments,\nincluding the duration and spread of the outbreak, the availability and distribution of vaccines, and their impact\non our customers and our sales cycles. During the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022 and 2021, our estimates and\nassumptions required increased judgment and carried a higher degree of variability and volatility. As events\ncontinue to evolve and additional information becomes available, our estimates may change materially in future\nperiods.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2022 or 2021. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases and cash from proceeds\nfrom international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we had $ 10.2million and $ 50.5million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe employees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the\n68\nTable of Contents\namount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding amount is\nincluded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities. See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January       As of January\n31, 2022            31, 2021\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $        444,369    $        331,547\nLess: Allowance for credit losses             -17,000             -20,500\nLess: Allowance for returns                    -7,696             -16,344\nAccounts receivable, net             $        419,673    $        294,703\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Furthermore, the allowance for sales returns is recorded as\nan offset to accounts receivable, and changes to the allowance are classified as a reduction in revenue in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. We estimate returns from sales to customers based on historical chargebacks\nand return rates.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022, our assessment considered business and market disruptions caused by\nCOVID-19 and estimates of credit and collectibility trends. The continued volatility in market conditions and\nevolving shifts in credit trends are difficult to predict, causing variability and volatility that may have a\nmaterial impact on our allowance for credit losses in future periods. Below is a rollforward of our allowance for\ncredit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nJanuary 31, 2022       January 31, 2021\n-in thousands\nBalance as of beginning of year    $            20,500    $             5,150\nProvision for credit losses                     32,587                 25,651\nWrite-offs                                     -36,087                -10,301\nBalance as of end of year          $            17,000    $            20,500\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, which is reflected as a component of\nstockholders’ equity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair\nvalue were due to credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through\nallowance for credit losses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized\ngains and losses from the sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method.\nRealized gains and losses are reported in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\n69\nTable of Contents\nStrategic Investments\nWe hold strategic investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held debt and equity securities in\nwhich we do not have a controlling interest. Publicly held equity securities are measured using quoted prices in\ntheir respective active markets with changes recorded through gains on strategic investments, net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value\nare recorded at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from\nthe same issuer (i.e. using the measurement alternative) and are recorded through gains on strategic investments,\nnet in the consolidated statements of operations.\nIf, based on the terms of these publicly traded and privately held securities, we determine that we exercise\nsignificant influence on the entity to which these securities relate, we will apply the equity method of accounting\nfor such investments. Privately held equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method are measured\nat cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss, which is reported in\ngains on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPrivately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated\nother comprehensive (loss) income on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess our privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio\nfor indicators for impairment. As of January 31, 2022, we have not recognized any impairments to our privately held\ndebt and equity securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications platform during the application\ndevelopment stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be used to perform\nthe function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and equipment, net.\nCosts related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s estimated useful\nlife, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated statements of\noperations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment whenever events\nor changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of\n70\nTable of Contents\nthese assets. We have capitalized $ 20.2million, $ 19.4million, and $ 3.1million of software development costs\nduring the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nLeases\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that\noption. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present\nvalue of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our incremental borrowing rate based on the\ninformation available at the commencement date in determining the lease liabilities as our leases generally do not\nprovide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to approximate the interest rate on a\ncollateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment where the leased asset is located.\nROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease\ncommencement date, less lease incentives received. We reassess the lease term if and when a significant event or\nchange in circumstances occurs within our control. We currently do not have any finance leases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were noimpairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2022, 2021, or 2020.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a\nbusiness combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates\nand assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that\nit is within the one-year measurement period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have onereporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2022 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense of developed technology is recorded within cost of\nrevenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n71\nTable of Contents\nWe routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events\nor changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible\nassets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible\nassets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite\nuseful life classification. If we determine that the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that\nasset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. There\nwere no impairment charges to acquired intangible assets during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional services,\nconsulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized\nreflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services. We determine revenue\nrecognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications platform, which consists of one or more software-based services. Our customers do not\nhave the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we provide a series of\ndistinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a professional\nmanner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include service-level\ncommitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and permitting those\ncustomers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits represent a form\nof variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements in the\nconsolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n72\nTable of Contents\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications platform and\nrelated services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the related revenue is\nrecognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 2% of total revenue during the periods presented.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications platform and providing\ngeneral operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located data center costs,\nthird-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses, amortization of\ncapitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated overhead\ncosts. Indirect overhead costs associated with corporate facilities and related depreciation, health care benefits,\ntraining, and other employee benefits are allocated to cost of revenue and operating expenses based on applicable\nheadcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications platform,\ndepreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and development\ncosts are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $ 40.9million, $\n34.8million, and $ 42.0million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards (including stock options, restricted stock awards\n(“RSAs”), RSUs, and ESPP) is measured based on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on\na straight-line basis over the requisite service period.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the\nfair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of\nour common stock, risk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSA and RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant\ndate.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period. Foreign currency related gains and\nlosses have been immaterial during the periods presented.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future\n73\nTable of Contents\nreversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies,\ncarryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes on the basis of a two-step process in\nwhich (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of\nthe technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon\nultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax\npositions, which involve significant judgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these\nuncertain tax positions in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions as a\ncomponent of our provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are included with the related tax\nliability.\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock, which includes early exercised stock options and RSAs, to be participating securities as holders of\nsuch securities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of\ncommon stock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in oneoperating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which\nseparate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Our chief operating\ndecision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.\nRevenue by geographical region can be found in the revenue recognition disclosures in Note 2 below. The following\ntable presents our property and equipment, net of depreciation and amortization, by geographic region:\nAs of January 31,\n2022\n(in thousands)          2021\nAmericas                             $            180,033    $  138,093\nAPAC                                               36,715        10,033\nEMEA                                                5,606         1,798\nTotal property and equipment, net    $            222,354    $  149,924\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and\nContract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to\nrecognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 606. ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 and early adoption is\npermitted. We do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.\n74\nTable of Contents\n2.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 59.7million and $ 24.6million as of January 31, 2022 and\n2021, respectively.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 858.2million, $ 222.0million, and $\n119.1million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2022, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n2,647.6million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 1,179.9million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 1,467.7million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 63%\nof our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do\nnot pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate\nwith the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the\nacquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and\nthe technological life of our unified communications platform and related significant features. Amortization of\ndeferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated statements of\noperations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit.

As of January 31, 2022, the fair value of the investment was $\n101.3million and our ownership interest represents approximately onepercent of the economic interest of the\ninvestee’s outstanding capital stock.\nIn the third quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made an additional strategic investment in equity securities of a\nprivate company. Based on the terms of these privately-held securities, we determined that we currently do not have\na controlling interest but have the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial\npolicies of the investee. Therefore this investment is currently accounted for under the equity method. The fair\nvalue of the investment was remeasured immediately before adopting the equity method of accounting, based on the\nobservable price from the most recent financing round. The carrying value of this investment was also adjusted by\nour share of the equity method investee’s operating result for the respective period, which was immaterial for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2022. As a result, we recognized a total gain of $ 49.9million on the existing\ninvestment during the third quarter of fiscal year 2022. As of January 31, 2022, the carrying amount of this\ninvestment was $ 93.4million.\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made a $ 100.0million strategic investment of common shares of a\nsoftware company in a private placement concurrent with the investee company’s merger. We recorded a loss of $\n32.5million related to this investment for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. As of January 31, 2022, the fair\nvalue of the investment was $ 67.5million and our ownership interest represents approximately twopercent of the\neconomic interest of the investee’s outstanding capital stock.\n77\nTable of Contents\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we also made a $ 75.0million strategic investment in equity securities\nof a private company. Based on the terms of these privately-held securities, we determined that we do not have a\ncontrolling interest nor the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of\nthe investee.

We classify our commercial\npaper, agency bonds, corporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, treasury bills, and\ncertificates of deposit within Level 2 because they are valued using inputs other than quoted prices that are\ndirectly or indirectly observable in the market, including readily available pricing sources for the identical\nunderlying security, which may not be actively traded. We classify our privately held debt securities as Level 3\ndue to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs, such as the probability weighting of the\nvarious scenarios that can impact settlement of the arrangement.\n5. Business Combinations\nOn May 7, 2020, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Keybase, Inc. (“Keybase”), a secure\nmessaging and file-sharing company, for purchase consideration of $ 42.9million in cash. The acquisition helps us\nstrengthen the security of our unified communications platform by providing end-to-end encryption expertise. The\nacquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration, $ 24.3million was attributed to goodwill, $ 3.3million to intangible\nassets, and $ 15.3million to other net assets acquired primarily consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $\n16.4million. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing products expected to be realized from\nthe acquisition and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes. Acquired\nintangible assets consisted of developed technology with an estimated useful life of five years. The developed\ntechnology had a remaining useful life of 3.3years as of January 31, 2022, and is amortized using the straight-line\nmethod over its estimated useful life.\nNot included in the purchase consideration, we also entered into holdback agreements with certain employees for $\n20.0million in cash payments, which are subject to such employees’ continued service with us. The holdback amount\nof $ 20.0million will be treated as compensation for research and development over the required service period\nranging from one yearto three years.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were immaterial.

Operating Leases\nWe have entered into various operating lease agreements for office space, with remaining contractual periods of up\nto 8years. We also enter into equipment operating lease agreements related to our HaaS offering. As a practical\nexpedient, we account for HaaS with customers as a combined performance obligation with the right to access our\nunified communications platform under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers . HaaS was immaterial to our\nconsolidated financial statements. Many of our leases contain oneor more options to extend. As leases approach\nmaturity, we consider various factors such as market conditions and the terms of any renewal options that may exist\nto determine whether we are reasonably certain to exercise the options to extend the lease. Operating lease expense\nfor the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 22.8million, $ 14.5million and $ 9.7million ,\nrespectively, excluding short-term lease costs, variable lease costs, and sublease income, each of which was\nimmaterial for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 .\n81\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to operating leases was as follows:\nAs of January 31,\n2022\nReported as:                                 (in thousands, except life and\nAssets:                                                        percentages)                     2021\nOperating lease right-of-use         $                               95,965               $   97,649\nassets\nLiabilities:\nAccrued expenses and other\ncurrent                              $                               20,697               $   15,601\nliabilities\nOperating lease liabilities,                                         85,018                   90,415\nnoncurrent\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                              105,715               $  106,016\nWeighted average remaining lease                                             5.1 years                6.1 years\nterm\nWeighted average discount rate                                          4.0  %                   4.5  %\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to operating leases was as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2022         2021         2020\n-in thousands\nCash payments included in the\nmeasurement of our operating lease          $                  22,679    $  13,717    $   9,774\nliabilities\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\nrecognized in exchange for new operating    $                  16,784    $  39,918    $  34,993\nlease obligations\nAs of January 31, 2022, the future minimum lease payments included in the measurement of our operating lease\nliabilities are as follows:\nAs of January 31, 2022\n-in thousands\nYear Ending January 31,\n2023                                 $                  24,491\n2024                                                    24,234\n2025                                                    23,552\n2026                                                    18,467\n2027                                                    11,704\nThereafter                                              15,315\nTotal operating lease payments       $                 117,763\nLess: imputed interest                                 -12,048\nTotal operating lease liabilities    $                 105,715\n8. Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2022, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of less than 12 months of $ 227.2million and non-cancelable purchase obligations with a\nterm 12 months or longer of $ 159.4million.\n82\nTable of Contents\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy\ntaxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded sales\nand other tax liabilities of $ 87.2million and $ 85.6million, respectively, of which $ 33.3million and $\n27.5million are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 53.9million and $\n58.1million are included in other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated balance sheets, based\non our best estimate of the probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those dates. Our estimate of\na probable outcome under the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and marketing activities, revenue\nsubject to sales tax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each period. No significant\nadjustments to the sales and other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying consolidated financial\nstatements for changes to the assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our assumptions may occur in\nthe future as we obtain new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded liability.\nOther Contingencies\nIn June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York (“EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access\nto user data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to\nthe Tiananmen commemorations on Zoom. In July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S.\nAttorney’s Office for the Northern District of California (“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and\ninformation relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our encryption, and our\nstatements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public statements. In addition,\nthe NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and representatives of the\nChinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies,\nprocedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since received additional\nsubpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of these investigations\nand have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing, and we do not\nknow when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the investigations, or\nwhat actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these investigations, and a\nnegative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines, penalties, or other\nfinancial exposure.\nLegal Proceedings\nOn April 7, 2020, and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our\nofficers in the United States District Court for the NDCA. The plaintiffs are purported stockholders of the\nCompany. The complaints allege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities\nExchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about\nour data privacy and security measures. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On May\n18, 2020, the actions were consolidated. On November 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On December 23,\n2020, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on\nMay 20, 2021. Plaintiff filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on July 9, 2021. Our reply in support of the\nmotion to dismiss was filed on August 9, 2021. On February 16, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our\nmotion to dismiss.\n83\nTable of Contents\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. The consolidated case is\nstayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. On October 27, 2021, a third\nsubstantially identical lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants, seeking unspecified\nmonetary damages and governance reforms. On November 17, 2021, all threederivative lawsuits were consolidated and\nstayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action.\nWe believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves against them. Given the\nuncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among\nother things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss that may result from these actions.\nBeginning on March 30, 2020, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in various U.S. federal district\ncourts and state courts relating to our alleged privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with\nthird parties (the “U.S. Privacy Class Actions”). The plaintiffs claim violations of a variety of state consumer\nprotection and privacy laws, and also assert state constitutional and common law claims, such as negligence and\nunjust enrichment. The U.S. Privacy Class Actions seek to certify both nationwide and state-specific classes of\nindividuals using our services in certain time periods. The plaintiffs seek various forms of injunctive and\nmonetary relief, including restitution, statutory and actual damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees. The\nfederal cases have been transferred to and consolidated in the NDCA with our consent; lead plaintiffs’ counsel have\nbeen appointed; and plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class action complaint on October 28, 2020.\nOn March 11, 2021, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion to dismiss, and gave plaintiffs leave\nto amend. On July 30, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs to settle the action on a\nclasswide basis, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the settlement with the court on July\n31, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the court preliminarily approved the settlement. Under the terms of the settlement,\nwe have paid $ 85.0million into an escrow account that will be used to pay claims filed by settlement class\nmembers, attorneys’ fees and expenses, administrative costs, and service payments to plaintiffs. The Court has\nscheduled a final approval hearing to take place on April 7, 2022. We recorded an aggregate legal settlement charge\nof $ 66.9million net of amounts estimated to be covered by insurance as a general and administrative expense in our\nconsolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nOn January 19, 2021, we finalized a settlement agreement with the FTC which requires us to implement certain\ninjunctive provisions, including, among other things, refraining from making any misrepresentations regarding the\nprivacy and security of our services or how we collect, maintain, use, delete, disclose, allow access to, and\nprotect user information. It also requires us to implement a detailed information security program and obtain\nthird-party security assessments periodically. We do not expect the settlement to have a material impact on our\nfinancial results. We are cooperating with the FTC’s requirements and working to ensure compliance.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n9. Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\nConvertible Preferred Stock\nUpon completion of the IPO in April 2019, all shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding, totaling\n152,665,804shares, were automatically converted into an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock on a\none-to-one basis and their carrying value of $ 159.6million was reclassified into stockholders’ equity. As of\nJanuary 31, 2022 and 2021, there were noshares of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nIn connection with the IPO, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective, which\nauthorized the issuance of 200,000,000shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001with rights\nand preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors.\n84\nTable of Contents\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into oneshare of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into oneshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into oneshare of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that is authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\nEquity Financing\nOn April 23, 2019, we completed our IPO, in which we issued and sold 9,911,434shares of our Class A common stock at\n$ 36.00per share. On April 18, 2019, the underwriters exercised their option to purchase an additional\n3,130,435shares of our Class A common stock at $ 36.00per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 447.9million,\nnet of underwriters’ discounts and commissions. In connection with the IPO:\nall of the shares of convertible preferred stock outstanding automatically converted into an aggregate of\n152,665,804shares of Class B common stock;\noutstanding convertible promissory notes and accrued interest automatically converted into 426,223shares of Class\nA common stock based on the IPO price of $ 36.00per share; and\nSalesforce Ventures LLC purchased 2,777,777shares of Class A common stock from us at $ 36.00per share in a\nconcurrent private placement. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 100.0million and did not pay any underwriting\ndiscounts or commissions with respect to the shares of Class A common stock that were sold in this private\nplacement.\nDeferred offering costs consist primarily of accounting, legal, and other fees related to our IPO. Prior to the\nIPO, all deferred offering costs were capitalized in other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAfter the IPO, $ 6.4million of deferred offering costs were reclassified into stockholders’ equity (deficit) as a\nreduction of the IPO proceeds in the consolidated balance sheets. We capitalized $ 2.4million of deferred offering\ncosts within other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheet as of January 31, 2019, which were\nreclassified into additional paid-in capital upon the completion of the IPO.\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed our follow-on public offering, in which we issued and sold 5,882,353shares of our\nClass A common stock, including 735,294shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter's option to purchase\nadditional shares, at $ 340.00per share.

In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSAs, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The awards generally vest over four years. The plan administrator determines the term of stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10years. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock\nthat may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not exceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the\nsum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an additional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of\n(A) shares that remain available for the issuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time\nour 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B) shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or\nother stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or\nexpire prior to exercise or settlement; are not issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because\nof the failure to vest; or are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or\nthe purchase or exercise price, if any, as such shares become available from time to time.

The weighted-average grant date\nfair value of options granted to employees during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2020 was $ 25.17. The intrinsic\nvalue of the options exercised, which represents the difference between the fair market value of our common stock\non the date of exercise and the exercise price of each option, was $ 843.0million, $ 1,786.7million, and $\n767.3million during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. As of January 31, 2022,\nunrecognized stock-based compensation expense\n86\nTable of Contents\nrelated to outstanding unvested stock options was $ 19.7million, which is expected to be recognized over a\nweighted-average period of 0.8years.\nThe Black-Scholes assumptions used to value the employee options at the grant dates are as follows:\nYear Ended January 31, 2020\nExpected term (years)      5.0-6.1\nExpected volatility        49.9% -53.2%\nRisk-free interest rate    1.6% -2.5%\nExpected dividend yield    —\nThese assumptions and estimates were determined as follows:\nFair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, the fair value was determined by our board of directors, with input\nfrom management and valuation reports prepared by third-party valuation specialists. Stock-based compensation for\nfinancial reporting purposes is measured based on updated estimates of fair value when appropriate, such as when\nadditional relevant information related to the estimate becomes available in a valuation report issued as of a\nsubsequent date. After our initial public offering, the fair value of each share of underlying common stock was\nbased on the closing price of our Class A common stock as reported on the date of the grant.\nRisk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate for the expected term of the options was based on the U.S.\nTreasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant.\nExpected Term. The expected term of options represents the period of time that options are expected to be\noutstanding. Our historical stock option exercise experience does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to\nestimate an expected term due to a lack of sufficient data. For stock options granted to employees, we estimate the\nexpected term by using the simplified method. The simplified method calculates the expected term as the average of\nthe time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the stock options. For stock options granted to nonemployees, the\nexpected term equals the contractual term of the stock option.\nExpected Volatility. As we have a short trading history for our common stock, the expected volatility was\nestimated by taking the average historic price volatility for industry peers, consisting of several public\ncompanies in our industry that are similar in size, stage of life cycle, or financial leverage, over a period\nequivalent to the expected term of the awards.\nExpected Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, an expected dividend yield of zero percent was used.\nRestricted Stock Units\nA summary of RSU activity under our equity incentive plan and related information is as follows:\nRSUs\nUnvested                      Weighted-Average\nRSUs       Grant Date Fair Value Per Share\nUnvested as of January 31, 2021     4,510,730    $                           194.57\nGranted                             3,195,949    $                           265.12\nVested                             -1,768,702    $                           190.36\nCanceled/forfeited                   -391,611    $                           250.92\nUnvested as of January 31, 2022     5,546,366    $                           232.58\nIn October 2021, we added a feature to new and existing stock awards that provides employees with additional awards\nbased on certain stock price criteria. The value of the modified RSUs began to be recognized as compensation\nexpense in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 and will continue to be recognized through the remaining\nrequisite service period for the RSUs. This had an immaterial impact on our consolidated statement of operations\nfor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nAs of January 31, 2022, unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to outstanding unvested RSUs was $\n1,437.2million, including the impact of the modification, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-\naverage period of 2.8years.\n87\nTable of Contents\n2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 ESPP, which became effective in connection with the IPO. A total of\n9,000,000shares of our Class A common stock were initially reserved for issuance under the ESPP. The number of\nshares of our Class A common stock reserved for issuance automatically increases on February 1 of each calendar\nyear, beginning on February 1, 2020 through February 1, 2029, by the lesser of (1) 1% of the total number of shares\nof our common stock (both Class A and Class B) outstanding on the last day of the fiscal year before the date of\nthe automatic increase, and (2) 7,500,000shares; provided that before the date of any such increase, our board of\ndirectors may determine that such increase will be less than the amount set forth in clauses (1) and (2).\nUnder our current ESPP, Class A common stock will be purchased for the accounts of employees participating in the\nESPP at a price per share equal to the lesser of (1) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common\nstock on the first date of an offering or (2) 85% of the fair market value of a share of our Class A common stock\non the date of purchase. No employee may purchase shares under the ESPP at a rate in excess of $ 25,000worth of our\nClass A common stock based on the fair market value per share of our Class A common stock at the beginning of an\noffering for each calendar year such purchase right is outstanding or 3,000shares. The 2019 ESPP provides for, at\nmaximum, 27months offering periods with fouroffering dates, generally in June and December of each year. The first\noffering period began on April 18, 2019.

We continued to record a valuation allowance through the first nine months\nof fiscal 2022. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, management concluded that the valuation allowance related to\nthe U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets was no longer needed primarily due to its assessment of income/loss\nin recent periods and the forecast of future taxable income. As of January 31, 2022, based on evaluation of all\npositive and negative evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets\nwill be realized for U.S. federal and state purposes. Accordingly, management has recognized a non-recurring tax\nbenefit of $ 328.0million related to the valuation allowance reversal. As of January 31, 2022, we continued to\nmaintain a valuation allowance of $ 12.6million related to net deferred tax assets of our U.K. subsidiary and will\nmaintain this valuation allowance until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or a portion of\nthe valuation allowance.\nAs of January 31, 2022, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 122.3million for state income\ntax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year 2033 if unused. We also had certain foreign net operating loss\ncarryforwards of $ 44.2million, which have an indefinite life.\nAs of January 31, 2022, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 18.4million\nfor state income tax purposes. The state research and development tax credits carry forward indefinitely.\nThe state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382 and Section\n383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar provisions under state law. Such provisions limit the net\noperating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year in the event of special occurrences, including\nsignificant ownership changes. We have completed a Section 382 review and determined that none of our operating\nlosses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s).\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n90\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits (in thousands)                         2022         2021        2020\nBalance, beginning of year                  $                  14,884    $   8,106    $  2,778\nTax Positions taken in prior year:\nGross increases                                                     —          314           —\nGross decreases                                                -3,764            —           —\nTax Positions taken in current year:\nGross increases                                                 8,211        6,001       5,328\nGross decreases                                                     —            —           —\nLapse of Statute of Limitations                                  -160         -422           —\nAcquisitions                                                        —          885           —\nBalance, end of year                        $                  19,171    $  14,884    $  8,106\nAs of January 31, 2022, gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 19.2million ($\n19.6million total, including $ 0.4million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2021, gross\nunrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 14.9million ($ 15.0million total, including $\n0.1million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2020, gross unrecognized tax benefits related\nto uncertain tax positions were $ 8.1million ($ 8.4million total, including $ 0.3million associated with interest\nand penalties). We recognized approximately $ 0.4million, $ 0.1million, and $ 0.3million in potential interest and\npenalties associated with uncertain tax positions during fiscal years ended January 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020,\nrespectively. To the extent taxes are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, substantially all\namounts accrued (including interest and penalties) will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall\nincome tax provision. Unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties are included in our\nincome tax provision.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2022, all of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax\nauthorities, for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating losses or tax credits are utilized.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is\nreasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\nOn March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“American Rescue Plan Act”) was passed into law and\namended portions of relevant tax laws. The American Rescue Plan Act did not have a significant impact on the\nprovision for income taxes for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\n91\nTable of Contents\n11.

          "content": "Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2022 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2022 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2022 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
