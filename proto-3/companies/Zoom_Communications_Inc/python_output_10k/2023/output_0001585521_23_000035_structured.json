BUSINESS\nOverview\nOur mission is to make communications frictionless and secure.\nZoom enables people to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their\nimagination. Our frictionless communications and collaboration platform started with video as its foundation, and\nwe have set the standard for innovation ever since. That is why Zoom is an intuitive, scalable, and secure choice\nfor large enterprises, small businesses, and individuals alike. We provide a unified communications and\ncollaboration platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact, connecting them\nthrough frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and more. Our Developer Platform enables\ncustomers, developers, and service providers to easily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-\nleading video communications and collaboration platform, with opportunities for global discovery and distribution.\nOur virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to seamlessly create and manage engaging events.\nOur cloud-native platform delivers reliable, high-quality video and voice solutions that are easy to use, manage,\nand deploy; provides an attractive return on investment; and is scalable and easily integrates with physical spaces\nand applications. As businesses around the world navigate a period of significant work transformation, Zoom’s\nability to enable meaningful connections whether teams are in the office, at home, on-the-go, or in other locations\nsuch as a retail or manufacturing setting, is a critical differentiator. We believe that rich and reliable\ncommunications lead to interactions that build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our\ncustomers place in us by delivering a communications solution that is secure, reliable, and “just works.”\nA cornerstone of our platform is Zoom Meetings, around which we provide a full suite of products and features\ndesigned to give users an easy, reliable, and innovative unified communications experience. Users comprise both\nhosts, who organize video meetings, and individual attendees, who participate in those video meetings. In 2019, we\nlaunched Zoom Phone, a cloud-based PBX system, creating a unique unified communications and collaboration platform.\nMany customers also choose to implement Zoom Rooms, our software-based conference room system, which enables users\nto easily experience Zoom Meetings in their physical meeting spaces.\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, during fiscal year 2023\nwe announced Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for video and integrated\nright into the same Zoom experience as well as Zoom Whiteboard, a persistent whiteboard tool for team collaboration\nin and outside of meetings and Zoom IQ for Sales, a conversation intelligence software for Zoom Meetings, which\nprovides sales teams with meaningful and actionable insights from their customer interactions to improve seller\nperformance and enhance customer experiences. As of February 2023, Zoom Mail and Calendar are generally available,\nwhich include both client experiences (Zoom Mail Client, Zoom Calendar Client) and service components (Zoom Mail\nService, Zoom Calendar Service). Lastly, we launched Zoom Virtual Agent, an AI-powered chatbot that understands\ncustomer questions and provides accurate answers quickly.\nThe happiness we bring is recognized by customers. Zoom has consistently high scores across customer review sites,\nincluding Gartner Peer Insights, TrustRadius, and G2 Crowd, including being recognized as a 2022 Gartner Peer\nInsights Customers’ Choice for Meeting Solutions as well as for Zoom Rooms and Zoom Video Webinars and a\nTrustRadius Top Rated Web Conferencing Software award along with nine other recognitions.

Viral enthusiasm begins with our users as they experience the simplicity and reliability of\nour platform – it “gets out of the way” so they can focus on what they need to get done together. This enthusiasm\ncontinues as meeting participants become paid hosts and as businesses of all sizes become our customers. Our sales\nefforts funnel this viral demand into routes-to-market that are optimized for each customer opportunity, which can\ninclude our direct sales force, online channel, resellers, and strategic partners.\n6\nTable of Contents\nOur Growth Strategy\nWe focus on the following elements of our strategy to drive our growth:\nKeep our existing customers happy.

Our platform is designed to make it easy to host meetings. By attracting free\nhosts to use our platform, we promote usage that allows hosts and their meeting attendees to experience the Zoom\ndifference.

As organizations experience our platform and become familiar with its benefits,\nmore teams and departments within these organizations adopt Zoom. Our platform may begin in a line of business and\nthen organically expand across departments. This “land and expand” model has led to some of our largest\ndeployments.

Our engineers aim to stay on the cutting edge of communication and\ncollaboration technologies.

We face competition from legacy web-based meeting services\nproviders, including Cisco Webex and GoTo, bundled productivity solution providers with video functionality,\nincluding Google Workspace and Microsoft Teams, and UCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including 8x8, Avaya, and\nRingCentral, as well as consumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including\nAmazon, Apple, and Facebook.

Our\nsoftware is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy requires employees and\nindependent contractors to sign agreements (1) assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship,\nand other intellectual property generated by them in the course of their employment, and (2) agreeing to protect\nour confidential information.\nIn certain circumstances, we license intellectual property from third parties for use in our products.

We offer a wide array of\nbenefits including comprehensive healthcare benefits, including mental health and fertility benefits, wellness\nbenefits, a book reimbursement plan to support continuous learning, and charitable gift matching through our Zoom\nCares program.\nOver the past several years, we conducted a comprehensive employee survey with regular follow-ups and engaged in\npeer research to make thoughtful decisions on how to move forward in an evolving world of work. Two priorities were\nimmediately clear: keeping our employees safe and supporting them through a meaningful employee experience. We\nbelieve maintaining a flexible working environment for our employees is a key priority.

You should carefully consider the risks and\nuncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K,\nincluding the section titled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before making a decision to invest in our\nsecurities. The risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones we face. If any of the risks\nactually occur, our business could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the market price of our\nClass A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nOur business depends on our ability to attract new customers, retain and upsell additional products and new product\ncategories to existing customers, and upgrade free hosts to our paid offerings. Any decline in new customers,\nrenewals, or upgrades would harm our business.\nOur business depends upon our ability to attract new customers, and maintain and expand our relationships with our\nexisting customers, including upselling additional products and new product categories to our existing customers\nand upgrading hosts to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. A host is any user of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more participants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts\nwho subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.”\nOur business is subscription based, and customers are not obligated to, and may choose not to, renew their\nsubscriptions after their existing subscriptions expire. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that customers\nwill renew their subscriptions utilizing the same tier of their Zoom Meeting plan, upgrade to a higher-priced tier,\nor purchase additional products, if they renew at all. Renewals of subscriptions to our platform may decline or\nfluctuate because of several factors, such as dissatisfaction with our products and support, a customer or host no\nlonger having a need for our products, including any new customers or hosts that have subscribed to our services\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic that may subsequently reduce or discontinue their use after the impact of the pandemic\nhave tapered, a reduction in customer information technology spending budgets, or a consolidation of spending\nbudgets on our competitors' platforms, during periods of high inflation or recessionary or uncertain economic\nenvironments or the perception that competitive products provide better, more secure, or less expensive options. In\naddition, some customers downgrade their Zoom Meeting plan or do not renew their subscriptions. Furthermore, as a\nresult of the increased usage of our platform during the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer base has shifted largely\nfrom businesses and enterprises to a mix of businesses, enterprises, and consumers. This shift in mix could result\nin higher non-renewal rates than we have experienced in the past. We must continually add new customers and hosts\nto grow our business beyond our current user base and to replace customers and hosts who choose not to continue to\nuse our platform. Finally, any decrease in user satisfaction with our products or support would harm our brand,\nword-of-mouth referrals, and ability to grow.\nWe encourage customers to purchase additional products and encourage hosts to upgrade to our paid offerings by\nrecommending additional features and through in-product prompts and notifications. Additionally, we seek to expand\nwithin organizations by adding new hosts, having workplaces purchase additional products, or expanding the use of\nour platform into other teams and departments within an organization. At the same time, we encourage hosts that\nsubscribe to our free Zoom\n13\nTable of Contents\nMeeting plan to upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. However, a majority of these hosts, including those that\ninitially subscribed to our free plan during the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of shelter-in-place and work-from-\nhome mandates, may never upgrade to a paid Zoom Meeting plan. If we fail to upsell our customers or upgrade hosts\nof our free Zoom Meeting plan to paid subscriptions or expand the number of paid hosts within organizations, our\nbusiness would be harmed.\nIn addition, our user growth rate may slow or decline in the future as our market penetration rates increase. If we\nare not able to continue to expand our user base, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline. While\nwe continue to add paid users to our customer base, we expect our user growth rate to continue to slow or decline\nduring the COVID-19 pandemic recovery, particularly as users return to work or school or are otherwise no longer\nsubject to limitations on in-person meetings.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in prior periods, and may decline in future periods.\nOur revenue growth has fluctuated in prior periods. We have previously experienced periods of significant revenue\ngrowth. You should not rely on the revenue growth of any prior quarterly or annual period as an indication of our\nfuture performance. Our revenue growth rate over the past year has stabilized but there are no assurances we will\nbe able to sustain or increase it in future periods, and our revenue growth rate may decline in future periods.\nMany factors may contribute to declines in our growth rate, including higher market penetration, increased\ncompetition, macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, recessionary or uncertain environments and\nfluctuating foreign currency exchange rates, slowing demand for our platform, especially during the COVID-19\npandemic recovery, which has led to users returning to work or school or are otherwise no longer being subject to\nlimitations on in-person meetings, a lower than anticipated capitalization on growth opportunities, and the\nmaturation of our business, among others. Our growth rate could adversely affect investors’ perceptions of our\nbusiness and the trading price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nInterruptions, delays, or outages in service from our co-located data centers and a variety of other factors, would\nimpair the delivery of our services, require us to issue credits or pay penalties, and harm our business.\nWe currently serve our users from various co-located data centers located throughout the world. We also utilize\nAmazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud for the hosting of certain critical aspects of our business, as well as\nMicrosoft Azure for limited customer-specified managed services. As part of our distributed meeting architecture,\nwe establish private links between data centers that automatically transfer data between various data centers.\nDamage to, or failure of, these data centers has in the past resulted in and could in the future result in\ninterruptions or delays in our services. In addition, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, other\ninterruptions and delays in our services caused by a variety of other factors, including, but not limited to,\ninfrastructure changes, vendor issues, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks, ransomware or cyber\nextortion, fraud, general internet availability issues, spikes in usage, local administrative actions, changes to\nlegal or permitting requirements, and denial of service issues. In some instances, we may not be able to identify\nthe cause or causes of these problems within an acceptable period of time. For example, we have experienced partial\noutages in our services that impacted a subset of our users for a limited number of hours. Additionally, in\nconnection with the addition of new data centers or expansion or consolidation of our existing data center\nfacilities or other reasons, we may move or transfer our data and our users’ metadata to other data centers, not\nincluding our China data center. Despite precautions that we take during this process, any unsuccessful data\ntransfers may impair or cause disruptions in the delivery of our service, and we may incur significant costs in\nconnection with any such move or transfer. Interruptions, delays, or outages in our services would reduce our\nrevenue; may require us to issue credits or pay penalties; may subject us to claims and litigation; and may cause\ncustomers and hosts to terminate their subscriptions and adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and\nhosts. Our ability to attract and retain customers and hosts depends on our ability to provide customers and hosts\nwith a highly reliable platform and even minor interruptions or delays in our services could harm our business.\nAdditionally, if our data centers are unable to keep up with our increasing needs for capacity, customers may\nexperience delays or interruptions in service as we seek to obtain additional capacity, which could result in the\nloss of customers who use our unified communications and collaboration platform because of its reliability and\nperformance. We plan to continue our practice of opening new data centers throughout the world to meet increased\ndemand, but we may be unable to bring additional data centers online in a timely manner, including as a result of\ncurrent shortages for certain parts, such as servers. In addition, to meet short-term capacity needs, we may need\nto rely increasingly on public cloud providers, including Amazon Web Services and Oracle Cloud, which may result in\nhigher variable costs, harming our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe do not control, or in some cases have limited control over, the operation of the co-located data center\nfacilities we use, and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error; intentional bad acts;\nearthquakes; floods; fires; hurricanes; war; terrorist attacks; power losses; hardware failures; systems failures;\ntelecommunications failures; disease, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and other public health related measures, any\nof which could disrupt our service. In the event of significant physical damage to one of these data centers, it\nmay take a significant period of time to achieve full resumption of our services and our disaster recovery planning\nmay not account for all eventualities. Despite precautions taken at these\n14\nTable of Contents\nfacilities, the occurrence of a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, or other act of malfeasance, a decision to\nclose the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at the facilities would harm our\nbusiness.\nWe operate in competitive markets, and we must continue to compete effectively.\nThe market for communication and collaboration technologies platforms is competitive and rapidly changing. Certain\nfeatures of our current platform compete in the communication and collaboration technologies market with products\noffered by:\nlegacy web-based meeting providers, including Cisco Webex and GoTo;\nbundled productivity solutions providers with video functionality, including Microsoft Teams and Google G Suite\nand Meet products;\nUCaaS and legacy PBX providers, including Avaya, RingCentral, and 8x8; and\nconsumer-facing platforms that can support small- or medium-sized businesses, including Amazon, Apple, and\nFacebook.\nOther large established companies may also make investments in video communications tools. In addition, as we\nintroduce new products and services into our platform, and with the introduction of new technologies and market\nentrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future.\nIn February 2022, we launched Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel contact center solution that is optimized for\nvideo, which, as we build out our offering, may result in increased competition against companies that offer\nsimilar services, such as Five9, Inc., Genesys and NICE inContact, and new competitors that may enter that market\nin the future. As we continue to build out our platform, we may face increased competition against companies that\noffer similar services and new competitors that may enter that market in the future. During the COVID-19 pandemic,\nwe saw a significant increase in usage and subscriptions from smaller customers, many of whom are consumers or\nsmall and medium sized businesses. With respect to these smaller customers, we face competition from more consumer-\noriented platforms, most of which have more experience with the consumer market than we do. Further, many of our\nactual and potential competitors benefit from competitive advantages over us, such as greater name recognition;\nlonger operating histories; more varied products and services; larger marketing budgets; more established marketing\nrelationships; more third-party integration; greater accessibility across devices or applications; greater access\nto larger user bases; major distribution agreements with hardware manufacturers and resellers; and greater\nfinancial, technical, and other resources. Some of our competitors may make acquisitions or strategic investments\nor enter into strategic relationships to offer a broader range of products and services than we do, which may\nprevent us from using such third parties' technology or offering such products or services. These combinations may\nmake it more difficult for us to compete effectively. We expect these trends to continue as competitors attempt to\nstrengthen or maintain their market positions.\nDemand for our platform is also price sensitive. Many factors, including our marketing, user acquisition, and\ntechnology costs, and our current and future competitors’ pricing and marketing strategies, can significantly\naffect our pricing strategies. Certain competitors offer, or may in the future offer, lower-priced or free\nproducts, or services that compete with our platform, or may bundle and offer a broader range of products and\nservices than we do. Similarly, certain competitors may use marketing strategies that enable them to acquire\ncustomers at a lower cost than we can. Furthermore, third parties could build products similar to ours that rely on\nopen source software. Even if such products do not include all the features and functionality that our platform\nprovides, we could face pricing pressure from these third parties to the extent that users find such alternative\nproducts to be sufficient to meet their video communications needs. There can be no assurance that we will not be\nforced to engage in price-cutting initiatives or other discounts or to increase our marketing and other expenses to\nattract and retain customers in response to competitive pressures, either of which would harm our business. We, on\noccasion, offer customers a free period of time at the beginning of the subscription term that can result in\ndeferred billings or long-term accounts receivable and increase the risk of loss on uncollected accounts\nreceivable.\nOur results have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly and may not fully reflect the underlying\nperformance of our business.\nOur results of operations have fluctuated and may in the future fluctuate significantly, and period-to-period\ncomparisons of our results of operations may not be meaningful. Accordingly, the results of any one quarter or\nperiod should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our results of operations may fluctuate as\na result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control, and as a result, may not fully reflect\nthe underlying performance of our business. For example, during fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in\nusage of our unified communications and collaboration platform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant\nportion of which was attributable to free Basic accounts, which do not generate any revenue. To meet this increased\ndemand, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with upgrading our\ninfrastructure and expanding our capacity, including higher variable costs to the extent we have had to rely on\npublic cloud providers rather than our own data centers. Fluctuation in our results may negatively impact the\n15\nTable of Contents\nvalue of our securities. Factors that may cause fluctuations in our results of operations include, without\nlimitation, those listed below:\nour ability to retain and upgrade customers to higher-priced tiers of Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to attract new hosts and upgrade hosts that subscribe to our free Zoom Meeting plan to one of our\npaid Zoom Meeting plans;\nour ability to hire and retain employees, in particular those responsible for the selling or marketing of our\nplatform;\nour ability to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel who are able to achieve desired productivity\nlevels in a reasonable period of time and provide sales leadership in areas in which we are expanding our sales and\nmarketing efforts;\nchanges in the way we organize and compensate our sales teams;\nthe timing of expenses and recognition of revenue;\nour ability to increase sales to large organizations;\nthe length of our sales cycles and linearity of our bookings, especially with respect to sales to large\nenterprises and highly regulated industries, including financial services and U.S. federal and state and foreign\ngovernmental agencies;\nthe amount and timing of operating expenses related to the maintenance and expansion of our business, operations,\nand infrastructure, as well as international expansion and entry into operating leases; and the hiring and\nretention of personnel who can build, manage, and maintain our expanded business operations and infrastructure;\ntiming and effectiveness of new sales and marketing initiatives;\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\nour ability to hire and retain experienced research and development personnel to design new products, features,\nand functionality that meet our privacy and security standards;\nthe timing and success of new products, features, and functionality by us or our competitors;\ninterruptions or delays in our service; network outages; or actual, alleged, or perceived privacy violations or\nissues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nlawsuits, regulatory actions or investigations; legislator scrutiny; or negative publicity arising from actual,\nalleged, or perceived privacy violations or issues or security vulnerabilities, incidents, or breaches;\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our industry, including consolidation among competitors;\nchanges in laws and regulations that impact our business;\nany large indemnification payments to our users or other third parties;\nthe timing of expenses related to any future acquisitions; and\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nOur business may be significantly affected by changes in the economy, including any resulting effect on consumer or\nbusiness spending.\nOur business may be affected by changes in the economy, such as high inflation, recessionary or uncertain\nenvironments, fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange rates and global impacts, including the Russian\ninvasion of Ukraine and the United States' ongoing trade disputes with China and other countries. Some customers\nmay view a subscription to our platform as a cost-saving purchase, decreasing the need for business travel, others\nmay view a subscription to our platform as a discretionary purchase, and our customers may reduce their information\ntechnology spending on our platform during an economic downturn or during times of economic uncertainty. Given\ncurrent economic conditions, including inflation, we could experience a reduction in demand and loss of customers,\nespecially if the effects of the current economic environment have a prolonged impact on various industries that\nour unified communications and collaboration platform addresses. We would lose\n16\nTable of Contents\ncustomers as a result of customers ceasing to do business, and we could experience a material increase in longer\npayment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable from certain customers.\nAs we increase sales to large organizations, our sales cycles could lengthen, and we could experience greater\ndeployment challenges.\nWe have begun investing more resources into sales to large organizations. Large organizations typically undertake a\nsignificant evaluation and negotiation process due to their leverage, size, organizational structure, and approval\nrequirements, all of which can lengthen our sales cycle. We may also face unexpected deployment challenges with\nlarge organizations or more complicated deployment of our platform. Large organizations may demand additional\nfeatures, support services and pricing concessions, or require additional security management or control features.\nWe may spend substantial time, effort, and money on sales efforts to large organizations without any assurance that\nour efforts will produce any sales or that these customers will deploy our platform widely enough across their\norganization to justify our substantial up-front investment. As a result, we anticipate increased sales to large\norganizations will lead to higher up-front sales costs and greater unpredictability in our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition.\nWe generate revenue from sales of subscriptions to our platform, and any decline in demand for our platform or for\ncommunications and collaboration technologies in general would harm our business.\nWe generate, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our platform. As a\nresult, widespread acceptance and use of communications and collaboration technologies in general, and our platform\nin particular, is critical to our future growth and success. If the communications and collaboration technologies\nmarket fails to grow, or grows more slowly than we currently anticipate, demand for our platform could be\nnegatively affected.\nChanges in user preferences for communications and collaboration technologies may have a disproportionately greater\nimpact on us than if we offered multiple platforms or disparate products. Demand for communications and\ncollaboration technologies in general, and our platform in particular, is affected by a number of factors, many of\nwhich are beyond our control. Some of these potential factors include:\ngeneral awareness of the communications and collaboration technologies category;\navailability of products and services that compete with ours;\nnew modes of communications and collaboration that may be developed in the future;\na reduction in customer information technology spending budgets, or a consolidation of spending budgets on our\ncompetitors' platforms, during periods of high inflation or recessionary or uncertain economic environments;\nease of adoption and use;\nfeatures and platform experience;\nreliability of our platform, including frequency of outages;\nperformance;\nbrand;\nuser support; and\npricing.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is subject to rapidly changing user demand and trends in\npreferences. If we fail to successfully predict and address these changes and trends, meet user demands, or achieve\nmore widespread market acceptance of our platform, our business would be harmed.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and there are no assurances we will be able to maintain or increase\nprofitability in the future.\nWe have incurred net losses in the past and could incur net losses in the future. We intend to continue to expend\nsignificant funds to expand our direct sales force and marketing efforts to attract new customers and hosts and to\ndevelop and enhance our products and for general corporate purposes, including operations, hiring additional\npersonnel, including through acquisitions of other businesses, upgrading our infrastructure, addressing security\nand privacy issues, and expanding into new geographical markets. To the extent we are successful in increasing our\nuser base, we may also incur increased losses because, other than sales commissions, the costs associated with\nacquiring customers and hosts are generally incurred up front, while the subscription revenue is generally\nrecognized ratably over the subscription term, which can be monthly, annual, or on a multiyear basis. Our efforts\nto grow our business may be costlier than we expect, and we may not be able to increase our\n17\nTable of Contents\nrevenue enough to offset our higher operating expenses, which may result in decreased profitability. We may incur\nsignificant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including as a result of the other risks described\nherein, and unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays, and other unknown events. While free users\ncontinue to be a meaningful portion of the user base, we have directed marketing programs focused on converting\nfree users to paid subscriptions. Some of these new hosts using our platform on a free Basic account have upgraded\nto a paid Zoom Meeting plan but the remainder have not and may never do so. If we are unable to increase or sustain\nour profitability, the value of our business and Class A common stock may significantly decrease. Furthermore, it\nis difficult to predict the size and growth rate of our market, customer demand for our platform, user adoption and\nrenewal of our platform, the entry of competitive products and services, or the success of existing competitive\nproducts and services. As a result, we may not increase or maintain profitability in future periods. If we fail to\ngrow our revenue sufficiently to keep pace with our investments and other expenses, our business would be harmed.\nThe experience of our users depends upon the interoperability of our platform across devices, operating systems,\nand third-party applications that we do not control, and if we are not able to maintain and expand our\nrelationships with third parties to integrate our platform with their solutions, our business may be harmed.\nOne of the most important features of our platform is its broad interoperability with a range of diverse devices,\noperating systems, and third-party applications. Our platform is accessible from the web and from devices running\nWindows, Mac OS, iOS, Android, and Linux. We also have integrations with Atlassian, Dropbox, Google, Microsoft,\nSalesforce, Slack, and a variety of other productivity, collaboration, data management, and security vendors. We\nare dependent on the accessibility of our platform across these and other third-party operating systems and\napplications that we do not control. For example, given the broad adoption of Microsoft Office and other\nproductivity software, it is important that we are able to integrate with this software. Several of our competitors\nown, develop, operate, or distribute operating systems, app stores, co-located data center services, and other\nsoftware, and also have material business relationships with companies that own, develop, operate, or distribute\noperating systems, applications markets, co-located data center services, and other software that our platform\nrequires in order to operate. Moreover, some of these competitors have inherent advantages developing products and\nservices that more tightly integrate with their software and hardware platforms or those of their business\npartners.\nThird-party services and products are constantly evolving, and we may not be able to modify our platform to assure\nits compatibility with that of other third parties following development changes. In addition, some of our\ncompetitors may be able to disrupt the operations or compatibility of our platform with their products or services,\nor exert strong business influence on our ability to, and terms on which we, operate and distribute our platform.\nFor example, we currently offer products that directly compete with several large technology companies that we rely\non to ensure the interoperability of our platform with their products or services. As our respective products\nevolve, we expect this level of competition to increase. Should any of our competitors modify their products or\nstandards in a manner that degrades the functionality of our platform or gives preferential treatment to\ncompetitive products or services, whether to enhance their competitive position or for any other reason, the\ninteroperability of our platform with these products could decrease and our business could be harmed.\nIn addition, we provide, develop, and create applications for our platform partners that integrate our platform\nwith our partners’ various offerings. For example, our Zoom Meetings product integrates with tools offered by\ncompanies, such as Atlassian and Dropbox, to help teams get more done together. If we are not able to continue and\nexpand on existing and new relationships to integrate our platform with our partners’ solutions, or there are\nquality issues with our products or service interruptions of our products that integrate with our partners’\nsolutions, our business will be harmed.\nWe are subject to requirements imposed by app stores such as those operated by Apple and Google, who may change\ntheir technical requirements or policies in a manner that adversely impacts the way in which we or our partners\ncollect, use and share data from users. For example, Apple recently began requiring mobile applications using its\niOS mobile operating system to obtain a user’s permission to track them or access their device’s advertising\nidentifier for certain purposes. The long-term impact of these and any other privacy and regulatory changes remains\nuncertain. If we do not comply with applicable requirements imposed by app stores, we could lose access to the app\nstore and users, and our business would be harmed.\nWe may not be able to respond to rapid technological changes, extend our platform, or develop new features.\nThe communications and collaboration technologies market is characterized by rapid technological change and\nfrequent new product and service introductions. Our ability to grow our user base and increase revenue from\ncustomers will depend heavily on our ability to enhance and improve our platform; introduce new features and\nproducts; and interoperate across an increasing range of devices, operating systems, and third-party applications.\nOur customers may require features and capabilities that our current platform does not have. We invest\nsignificantly in research and development, and our goal is to focus our spending on measures that improve quality\nand ease of adoption, enhance privacy and security, and create organic user demand for our platform. There is no\nassurance that new additions or other future enhancements to our platform or new product experiences, features, or\ncapabilities will be compelling to our users or gain market acceptance, or that they will perform as expected. If\nour research and development investments do not accurately anticipate user demand or if we fail to\n18\nTable of Contents\ndevelop our platform in a manner that satisfies user preferences and requirements in a timely and cost-effective\nmanner, we may fail to retain our existing users or increase demand for our platform.\nThe introduction of new products and services by competitors or the development of entirely new technologies to\nreplace existing offerings could make our platform obsolete or adversely affect our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition. We may experience difficulties with software development, design, or marketing\nthat could delay or prevent our development, introduction, or implementation of new product experiences, features,\nor capabilities. We have in the past experienced delays in our internally planned release dates of new features and\ncapabilities and there can be no assurance that new product experiences, features, or capabilities will be released\naccording to schedule. Any delays could result in adverse publicity, loss of revenue or market acceptance, or\nclaims by users brought against us, all of which could harm our business. Moreover, new productivity features to\nour platform may require substantial investment, and we have no assurance that such investments will be successful.\nIf customers and hosts do not widely adopt our new product experiences, features, and capabilities, or they do not\nperform as expected, we may not be able to realize a return on our investment. If we are unable to develop,\nlicense, or acquire new features and capabilities to our platform on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such\nenhancements do not achieve market acceptance, our business would be harmed.\nThe failure to effectively develop and expand our marketing and sales capabilities could harm our ability to\nincrease our customer base and achieve broader market acceptance of our platform.\nOur ability to increase our customer and host base and achieve broader market acceptance of our products and\nservices will depend to a significant extent on our ability to expand our marketing and sales operations. We plan\nto continue expanding our sales force and strategic partners, both domestically and internationally. If we are\nunable to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales personnel in the near term, our future revenue growth and\nbusiness could be adversely impacted.\nIdentifying and recruiting qualified sales representatives and training them is time consuming and resource\nintensive, and they may not be fully trained and productive for a significant amount of time. We also plan to\ndedicate significant resources to sales and marketing programs, including internet and other online advertising.\nAll of these efforts will require us to invest significant financial and other resources. In addition, the cost to\nacquire customers and hosts is high due to these marketing and sales efforts. Our business will be harmed if our\nefforts do not generate a correspondingly significant increase in revenue. We will not achieve anticipated revenue\ngrowth from expanding our sales force if we are unable to hire, develop, and retain talented sales personnel, our\nnew sales personnel are unable to achieve desired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time, or if our\nsales and marketing programs are not effective.\nFailures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or potential users to\nbelieve that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to our competitors, or\nto cancel their subscriptions to our platform.\nUnlike traditional communications and collaborations technologies, our services depend on our users’ high-speed\nbroadband access to the internet, usually provided through a cable or digital subscriber line connection.\nIncreasing numbers of users and increasing bandwidth requirements may degrade the performance of our platform due\nto capacity constraints and other internet infrastructure limitations. As our number of users has grown and their\nusage of communications capacity has increased, we have been required to make additional investments in network\ncapacity to maintain adequate data transmission speeds, the availability of which may be limited, or the cost of\nwhich may be on terms unacceptable to us. If adequate capacity does not continue to be available to us as our user\nbase grows in the future, our network may be unable to achieve or maintain sufficiently high data transmission\ncapacity, reliability, or performance. In addition, if internet service providers and other third parties providing\ninternet services have outages or deteriorations in their quality of service, our users will not have access to our\nplatform or may experience a decrease in the quality of our platform. Furthermore, as the rate of adoption of new\ntechnologies increases, the networks our platform relies on may not be able to sufficiently adapt to the increased\ndemand for these services, including ours. Frequent or persistent interruptions could cause current or potential\nusers to believe that our systems or platform are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid\nour platform, which could permanently harm our business.\nIn addition, users who access our platform through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets, must have a\nhigh-speed connection, such as 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, satellite, or Wi-Fi, to use our services and applications.\nCurrently, this access is provided by companies that have significant and increasing market power in the broadband\nand internet access marketplace, including incumbent phone companies, cable companies, satellite companies, and\nwireless companies. Some of these providers offer products and subscriptions that directly compete with our own\nofferings, which can potentially give them a competitive advantage. Also, these providers could take measures that\ndegrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to third-party services, including our platform, by\nrestricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate third-party services or by\ncharging increased fees to third parties or the users of third-party services, any of which would make our platform\nless attractive to users and reduce our revenue.\n19\nTable of Contents\nOn January 4, 2018, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) released an order reclassifying broadband\ninternet access as an information service, subject to certain provisions of Title I of the Communications Act. The\norder requires broadband providers to publicly disclose accurate information regarding network management\npractices, performance characteristics, and commercial terms of their broadband internet access services sufficient\nto enable consumers to make informed choices regarding the purchase and use of such services, and entrepreneurs and\nother small businesses to develop, market, and maintain internet offerings. The new rules went into effect on June\n11, 2018. Numerous parties filed judicial challenges to the order, and on October 1, 2019, the United States Court\nof Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit released a decision that rejected nearly all of the challenges to\nthe new rules, but reversed the FCC’s decision to prohibit all state and local regulation targeted at broadband\ninternet service, requiring case-by-case determinations as to whether state and local regulation conflicts with the\nFCC’s rules. The court also required the FCC to reexamine three issues from the order but allowed the order to\nremain in effect, while the FCC conducts that review. On October 27, 2020, the FCC adopted an order concluding that\nthe three issues remanded by the court did not provide a basis to alter its conclusions in the 2018 order.\nPetitions for reconsideration of this decision are pending and could be reversed by the current FCC after Democrats\ngain control. In addition, a number of states have adopted or are adopting or considering legislation or executive\nactions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. A federal court judge denied a request for a\npreliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network neutrality law, and as a result, California\nbegan enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. The appeal of that decision and a petition for rehearing were denied in\nJanuary and April 2022, respectively. A number of other states have adopted or are adopting or considering\nlegislation or executive actions that would regulate the conduct of broadband providers. A similar law in Vermont\nis subject to a pending challenge, but went into effect on April 20, 2022. We cannot predict whether the FCC order\nor other state initiatives will be enforced, modified, overturned, or vacated by legal action of the court, federal\nlegislation, or the FCC. Under the FCC’s new rules, broadband internet access providers may be able to charge web-\nbased services such as ours for priority access or favor services offered by our competitors or by the internet\naccess providers themselves, which could result in increased costs and a loss of existing customers and hosts,\nimpair our ability to attract new customers and hosts, and harm our business.\nIf there are changes to the regulatory structures in the United States or elsewhere that reduce investment in\ninfrastructure by internet service providers, including a return of the network neutrality regulations that were\nrepealed, any impacts of reduced investment that reduce network capacity or speed could have a negative effect on\nour business, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur security measures have been compromised in the past and may be compromised in the future. If our security\nmeasures are compromised in the future or if our information technology fails, this could harm our reputation,\nexpose us to significant fines and liability, impair our sales, and harm our business. In addition, our products\nand services may be perceived as not being secure. This perception may result in customers and hosts curtailing or\nceasing their use of our products, our incurring significant liabilities, and our business being harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and the third parties upon which we rely collect, receive, store,\nprocess, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make accessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share\nconfidential, proprietary, and sensitive data, including data of ours, our customers, and our users, the data which\nincludes personal information, customer and user content, health-related data, intellectual property, trade\nsecrets, business plans, and financial information. We and the third parties upon which we rely face a variety of\nevolving threats, including but not limited to ransomware attacks, which could cause security incidents. Security\nincidents have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, resulting in unauthorized access to, loss or\nunauthorized disclosure of, or inadvertent disclosure of confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information.\nCyber-attacks, malicious internet-based activity, online and offline fraud, and other similar activities threaten\nthe confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data and\ninformation technology systems, and those of the third parties upon which we rely. Cloud-based platform providers\nof products and services have been and are expected to continue to be targeted. Threats are prevalent and continue\nto rise, are increasingly difficult to detect, and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer\n“hackers,” threat actors, “hacktivists,” organized criminal threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or\nmisuse), sophisticated nation-state and nation-state supported actors, and advanced persistent threat intrusions.\nSome actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyberattacks, including without limitation nation-\nstate actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During\ntimes of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a\nheightened risk of these attacks, including cyberattacks, that could materially disrupt our systems and operations,\nsupply chain, and ability to provide our services. We may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including\nbut not limited to social-engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses\nand worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks\n(such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server\nmalfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware,\ntelecommunications failures, earthquakes, fires, floods, and other similar threats. Ransomware attacks, including\nthose perpetrated by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are\nbecoming increasingly\n20\nTable of Contents\nprevalent and severe and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income,\nreputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware\nattack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations\nprohibiting such payments. Additionally, our platform, products, and services are relied on by a large number of\ncompanies worldwide and as a result, if our platform, products, or solutions are compromised, a significant number\nor all of our customers and their data could be simultaneously affected. The potential liability and associated\nconsequences we could suffer as a result of such a large-scale event could be catastrophic and result in\nirreparable harm.\nFuture or past business transactions (such as acquisitions or integrations) could expose us to additional\ncybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities, as our systems could be negatively affected by vulnerabilities present in\nacquired or integrated entities’ systems and technologies. Furthermore, we may discover security issues that were\nnot found during due diligence of such acquired or integrated entities, and it may be difficult to integrate\ncompanies into our information technology environment and security program.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party service providers could introduce new cybersecurity risks and\nvulnerabilities, including supply-chain attacks, and other threats to our business operations. We rely on third-\nparty service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process confidential, proprietary,\nand sensitive data in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, data center\nfacilities, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, and other\nfunctions. We also rely on third-party service providers to provide other products, services, parts, or otherwise\nto operate our business. Our ability to monitor these third parties’ information security practices is limited, and\nthese third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. If our third-party service\nproviders experience a security incident or other interruption, we could experience adverse consequences. While we\nmay be entitled to damages if our third-party service providers fail to satisfy their privacy or security-related\nobligations to us, any award may be insufficient to cover our damages, or we may be unable to recover such award.\nIn addition, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity, and we cannot guarantee that third\nparties’ infrastructure in our supply chain or our third-party partners’ supply chains have not been compromised.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security incident or other interruption that\ncould result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration,\nencryption, disclosure of, or access to confidential, proprietary, or sensitive data or our information technology\nsystems, or those of the third parties upon whom we rely. A security incident or other interruption could disrupt\nour ability (and that of third parties upon whom we rely) to provide our services. We may expend significant\nresources or modify our business activities to try to protect against security incidents. Additionally, certain\nprivacy, data protection, and information security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific\nsecurity measures or industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology\nsystems and sensitive data.\nIf our security measures are compromised, our reputation could be damaged; our data, information or intellectual\nproperty, or that of our customers, may be destroyed, stolen, or otherwise compromised; our business may be harmed;\nand we could incur significant liability. We take steps to detect and remediate vulnerabilities, but we may not be\nable to detect and remediate all vulnerabilities because the threats and techniques used to exploit the\nvulnerability change frequently and are often sophisticated in nature. Therefore, such vulnerabilities could be\nexploited but may not be detected until after a security incident has occurred. These vulnerabilities pose material\nrisks to our business. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to\naddress any such identified vulnerabilities. We have not always been able in the past and may be unable in the\nfuture to anticipate or prevent threats or techniques used to detect or exploit vulnerabilities in our services or\nsoftware or third-party software, or obtain unauthorized access to or compromise our systems.\nIn addition, security researchers and other individuals have in the past and will continue in the future to\nactively search for and exploit actual and potential vulnerabilities in our software or services. This activity may\nincrease because of increased demand for our services and increased media scrutiny of our unified communications\nand collaboration platform, and can lead to additional adverse publicity, reputational harm, extortion threats,\nbusiness and operational interruptions, security incidents, additional expenses, litigation, regulatory\ninvestigations and actions, and substantial harm to our business, some of which we have experienced during the\nCOVID-19 pandemic. For example, in July 2019, a security researcher published a blog highlighting concerns with the\nZoom Meeting platform, including certain video-on features. We were able to release updates to the software\naddressing these vulnerabilities, and we are not aware of any customers being affected or meetings compromised by\nthese vulnerabilities. In most cases customers are responsible for installing this update to the software, and\ntheir software is subject to these vulnerabilities until they do so. Additionally, in March 2020, a security\nresearcher reported certain vulnerabilities related to our macOS version that could have allowed an unauthorized\nperson to gain root access to a user’s system. Given the nature of our business and operations, our products and\nservices will inevitably contain vulnerabilities or critical security defects that have not been identified or\nremediated and cannot be disclosed without compromising security. We have identified vulnerabilities in our\nproducts and services in the past, and we expect that we will continue to identify vulnerabilities in the future.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to address any vulnerabilities in our software products\n21\nTable of Contents\nand services that we may become aware of in the future, or there may be delays in developing patches that can be\neffectively deployed to address vulnerabilities.\nWe will continue to make prioritization decisions to determine which vulnerabilities or security defects to fix and\nthe timing of these fixes, which could result in an exploit that compromises security. Further, in many cases,\ncustomers are responsible for installing our software updates, and until they do so, their service remains subject\nto the vulnerabilities addressed in the software update. Vulnerabilities and critical security defects, errors in\nremediating vulnerabilities or security defects, failure of third-party providers to remediate vulnerabilities or\nsecurity defects, or customers not deploying security releases or deciding not to install software updates could\nresult in claims of liability against us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business. Security incidents\nand vulnerabilities, and concerns regarding privacy, data protection, and information security may also cause some\nof our customers and hosts to stop using our solutions and fail to upgrade or renew their subscriptions. Failures\nto meet customers’ and hosts’ expectations with respect to security and confidentiality of their data and\ninformation could damage our reputation and affect our ability to retain customers and hosts, attract new customers\nand hosts, and grow our business. In addition, cybersecurity events or security vulnerabilities could result in\nbreaches of our agreements with customers, lawsuits against us (including class action litigation), regulatory\ninvestigations or actions, and significant increases in costs, including costs for remediating the effects of such\nan event or vulnerability, lost revenue due to network downtime, and a decrease in customer, host, and user trust,\nincreases in insurance premiums due to cybersecurity incidents, increased costs to address cybersecurity issues,\nand attempts to prevent future incidents, fines, penalties, judgments and settlements, and attorney fees, and harm\nto our business and our reputation because of any such incident.\nMany governments have enacted laws requiring companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving\ncertain types of personal information. Such laws are inconsistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data\nbreach is costly. In addition, some of our customers require us to notify them of data security breaches.\nActual or perceived security compromises experienced in our industry or by our competitors, our customers, a third\nparty upon whom we rely, or us could cause us to experience adverse consequences, such as government enforcement\nactions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements\nand/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive data (including personal data); litigation (including class\nclaims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions;\ninterruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. Security\nincidents and attendant consequences may cause customers to stop using our services, deter new customers from using\nour services, and negatively impact our ability to grow and operate our business.\nIn addition, while more than half of our employees are based in the United States, like many similarly situated\ntechnology companies, we have a sizable number of research and development personnel in China, which has exposed\nand could continue to expose us to governmental and regulatory as well as market and media scrutiny regarding the\nactual or perceived integrity of our platform or data security and privacy features.\nIncreased usage of our services, novel uses of our services, and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand could\nlead to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our information security and\npotential vulnerabilities associated with, our platform. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we opened our\nplatform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users, leading to challenges for users who did not have full IT\nsupport or established protocols for security and privacy like our larger customers. As a result, we have\nexperienced negative publicity related to meeting disruptions and security and privacy issues, including on\nencryption. Such unfavorable publicity and scrutiny could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer\nand user confidence, increased regulatory or litigation exposure, additional expenses, and other harm to our\nbusiness.\nThere can be no assurance that any limitations of liability provisions in our subscription agreements, terms of\nuse, or other agreements would be enforceable or adequate or would otherwise protect us from any such liabilities\nor damages with respect to any particular claim. We also cannot be sure that our existing general liability\ninsurance coverage and coverage for cyber liability or errors or omissions will continue to be available on\nacceptable terms or will be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims or that the insurer\nwill not deny coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that\nare not covered or exceed available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies,\nincluding premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could harm our\nbusiness.\nIn addition to experiencing a security incident, third parties may gather, collect, or infer sensitive information\nabout us from public sources, data brokers, or other means that reveals competitively sensitive details about our\norganization and could be used to undermine our competitive advantage or market position.\nOur business depends on a strong brand, and if we are not able to maintain and enhance our brand, our ability to\nexpand our base of users will be impaired and our business will be harmed.\n22\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that maintaining and enhancing the Zoom brand is critical to expanding our base of customers, hosts, and\nusers and, in particular, conveying to users and the public that the Zoom brand consists of a broad communications\nand collaboration platform, rather than just one distinct product. For example, if users view the Zoom brand\nprimarily as a video conferencing point solution or utility rather than as a platform that connects people through\nvideo, voice, chat and content sharing, or have a negative perception of our privacy and security, then our market\nposition may be detrimentally impacted. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive,\nmaintaining and enhancing our brand may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Any unfavorable publicity or\nperception of our platform, including any delays or interruptions in service due to capacity constraints stemming\nfrom increased usage or of our privacy or security features, or of the providers of communication and collaboration\ntechnologies generally, could adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain hosts.\nSimilarly, any unfavorable perception of our company, including due to any actual or perceived violation by our\nemployees of our policies, such as our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, could cause us reputational harm and\ncustomer loss, impact our financial performance, expose us to litigation, and harm our business, among other\nthings. If we fail to promote and maintain the Zoom brand, including consumer and public perception of our platform\nor our company, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business will be harmed.\nWe cannot assure you that we will successfully manage our growth.\nSince our founding in 2011, our employee headcount, both in the United States and internationally, has increased\nsignificantly over time. The growth and expansion of our business places a continuous, significant strain on our\nmanagement, operational, and financial resources. Further growth of our operations to support our user base, our\nexpanding third-party relationships, our information technology systems, and our internal controls and procedures\nmay not be adequate to support our operations. In addition, as we continue to grow, we face challenges integrating,\ndeveloping, and motivating our employee base in various countries around the world. Many of our personnel work\nremotely, which may lead to challenges in productivity and collaboration. Certain members of our management have\nnot previously worked together for an extended period of time, and some do not have prior experience managing a\npublic company, which may affect how they manage our growth effectively.\nIn addition, from time to time, we implement organizational changes to pursue greater efficiency and realign our\nbusiness and strategic priorities. In February 2023, we commenced certain restructuring actions (the “Restructuring\nPlan”), designed to reduce operating costs and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. We\nmay encounter challenges in the execution of these efforts, and these challenges could impact our financial\nresults.\nAlthough we believe that the Restructuring Plan will reduce operating costs and improve operating margins, we\ncannot guarantee that the Restructuring Plan will achieve or sustain the targeted benefits, or that the benefits,\neven if achieved, will be adequate to meet our long-term profitability and operational expectations. As a result of\nthese actions, we will incur additional charges in the near term, including those related to employee transition,\nseverance payments, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation. Additional risks associated with the\ncontinuing impact of the Restructuring Plan include employee attrition beyond our intended reduction in force and\nadverse effects on employee morale (which may also be further exacerbated by actual or perceived declining value of\nequity awards), diversion of management attention, adverse effects to our reputation as an employer (which could\nmake it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future), and potential failure or delays to meet\noperational and growth targets due to the loss of qualified employees. If we do not realize the expected benefits\nof our restructuring efforts on a timely basis or at all, our business, results of operations and financial\ncondition could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our historical rapid growth may make it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. Our ability to\nforecast our future results of operations is subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to\neffectively plan for and model future growth. We have encountered in the past, and may encounter in the future,\nrisks and uncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries. If we fail to\nachieve the necessary level of efficiency in our organization as it grows, or if we are not able to accurately\nforecast future growth, our business would be harmed.\nOur ability to sell subscriptions to our platform could be harmed by real or perceived material defects or errors\nin our platform.\nThe software technology underlying our platform is inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors,\nparticularly when new products are first introduced or when new features or capabilities are released. We have from\ntime to time found defects or errors in our platform, and new defects or errors in our existing platform or new\nproducts may be detected in the future by us or our users. There can be no assurance that our existing platform and\nnew products will not contain defects. Any real or perceived errors, failures, vulnerabilities, or bugs in our\nplatform have in the past resulted and could in the future result in negative publicity or lead to data security,\naccess, retention, or other performance issues, all of which could harm our business. The costs incurred in\ncorrecting such defects or errors may be substantial and could harm our business. Moreover, the harm to our\nreputation and legal liability related to such defects or errors may be substantial and would harm our business.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe also utilize hardware purchased or leased and software and services licensed from third parties to offer our\nplatform. Any defects in, or unavailability of, our or third-party hardware, software, or services that cause\ninterruptions to the availability of our services, loss of data, or performance issues could, among other things:\ncause a reduction in revenue or delay in market acceptance of our platform;\nrequire us to issue refunds to our customers or expose us to claims for damages;\ncause us to lose existing hosts and make it more difficult to attract new customers and hosts;\ndivert our development resources or require us to make extensive changes to our platform, which would increase\nour expenses;\nincrease our technical support costs; and\nharm our reputation and brand.\nIf we were to lose the services of our Chief Executive Officer or other members of our senior management team, we\nmay not be able to execute our business strategy.\nOur success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In\nparticular, our founder, President and Chief Executive Officer, Eric S. Yuan, is critical to our overall\nmanagement, as well as the continued development of our products, services, the Zoom platform, our culture, our\nstrategic direction, engineering, and our global operations, including regions such as the United States, Europe,\nMiddle East, and Africa (“EMEA”), and Asia Pacific (“APAC”). All of our executive officers are at-will employees,\nand we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies. Any changes in our senior management team in\nparticular, even in the ordinary course of business, may be disruptive to our business. Such changes may result in\na loss of institutional knowledge and cause disruptions to our business. If our senior management team fails to\nwork together effectively or execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis as a result of management turnover\nor otherwise, our business could be harmed.\nThe failure to attract and retain additional qualified personnel or to maintain our happiness-centric company\nculture could harm our business and culture and prevent us from executing our business strategy.\nTo execute our business strategy, we must attract and retain highly qualified personnel. Competition for\nexecutives, software developers, sales personnel, and other key employees in our industry is intense. In\nparticular, we compete with many other companies for software developers with high levels of experience in\ndesigning, developing, and managing software for communication and collaboration technologies, as well as for\nskilled sales and operations professionals. At times, we have experienced, and we may continue to experience,\ndifficulty in hiring and retaining employees with appropriate qualifications, and we may not be able to fill\npositions in a timely manner or at all, which may be exacerbated by our recent restructuring actions and any\nsimilar future actions. In addition, our recruiting personnel, methodology, and approach may need to be altered to\naddress a changing candidate pool and profile. We may not be able to identify or implement such changes in a timely\nmanner. In addition, we may experience employee turnover as a result of our recent restructuring actions. New hires\nrequire training and take time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as\nwe expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. If we fail to\nattract new personnel or fail to retain and motivate our current personnel, our business could be harmed.\nMany of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel have greater resources than we have, and some\nof these companies may offer more attractive compensation packages. Particularly in the San Francisco Bay Area, job\ncandidates and existing employees carefully consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with\ntheir employment. If the perceived value of our equity awards declines, or if the mix of equity and cash\ncompensation that we offer is unattractive, it may adversely affect our ability to recruit and retain highly\nskilled employees. Job candidates may also be threatened with legal action under agreements with their existing\nemployers if we attempt to hire them, which could impact hiring and result in a diversion of our time and\nresources. Additionally, laws and regulations, such as restrictive immigration laws, may limit our ability to\nrecruit internationally. Moreover, as we plan to reopen our offices, vaccine mandates and similar government orders\nand restrictions could result in employee attrition and difficulty in recruiting. We must also continue to retain\nand motivate existing employees through our compensation practices, company culture, and career development\nopportunities. If we fail to attract new personnel or to retain our current personnel, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe believe that a critical component to our success and our ability to retain our best people is our culture. As we\ncontinue to grow and develop a public company infrastructure, we may find it difficult to maintain our happiness-\ncentric company culture. Transparency is also an important part of our culture, and one that we practice every day.\nAs we continue to grow, maintaining this culture of transparency will present its own challenges that we will need\nto address, including the type of information and level of detail that we share with our employees.\n24\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, as our stock price has fluctuated since our initial public offering (“IPO”), employees joining us at\ndifferent times could have significant disparities in proceeds from sales of our equity in the public markets,\nwhich could create disparities in wealth among our employees, which may harm our culture and relations among\nemployees and our business. Further, the volatility of our stock price may make our equity compensation less\nattractive to current and potential employees, and could contribute to increased turnover or difficulties in\nhiring.\nWe have significant and expanding operations outside the United States, which may subject us to increased business,\nregulatory and economic risks that could harm our business.\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from APAC and EMEA collectively represented 30%, 33%, and 31% of our\ntotal revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. We plan to add local sales\nsupport in further select international markets over time. Our customers include multinational corporations with\nglobal users, and we expect to continue to expand our international operations, which includes opening offices in\nnew jurisdictions and providing our platform in additional languages to support the needs of these multinational\ncorporations. Any new markets or countries into which we attempt to allow users to access our services or sell\nsubscriptions to our platform may not be receptive. If we are not able to satisfy certain government- and industry-\nspecific requirements, we have in the past and may in the future experience service outages or other adverse\nconsequences that would impair our ability to operate in or to expand further into certain markets. For example,\nthe Chinese government has at times turned off our service in China without warning and requested that we take\ncertain steps prior to restoring our service, such as designating an in-house contact for law enforcement requests\nand transferring China-based user data housed in the United States to a data center in China. In addition, our\nability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally in the future requires considerable\nmanagement attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing\nbusiness in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative\ndispute systems, and commercial markets. Future international expansion will require investment of significant\nfunds and other resources. We also face risks related to recruiting and retaining talented and capable employees\noutside the United States, including complying with complex employment- and compensation-related laws, regulations,\nand practices in these international jurisdictions, and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices.\nWe may also be unable to grant equity compensation to employees in certain countries outside of the United States\ndue to the complexities of local laws and regulations. This may require us to offer equally compelling alternatives\nto supplement our compensation, such as long-term cash compensation plans or increased short-term cash\ncompensation, in order to continue to attract and retain employees in these jurisdictions.\nOperating internationally subjects us to new risks and increases risks that we currently face, including risks\nassociated with:\nproviding our platform and operating our business across a significant distance, in different languages and among\ndifferent cultures, including the potential need to modify our platform and features to ensure that they are\nculturally appropriate and relevant in different countries;\ncompliance with applicable international laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to\nprivacy, information security, telecommunications requirements, data protection, consumer protection, and\nunsolicited email, and the risk of penalties to us and individual members of management or employees if our\npractices are deemed to be out of compliance;\noperating in foreign jurisdictions where the government may impede or interrupt our ability to provide our\nservices;\nmanagement of an employee base in jurisdictions that may not give us the same employment and retention\nflexibility as the United States;\noperating in jurisdictions that do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United\nStates and the practical enforcement of such intellectual property rights outside of the United States;\nforeign government interference with our non-core intellectual property that resides outside of the United\nStates, such as the risk of changes in foreign laws that could restrict our ability to use our intellectual\nproperty outside of the foreign jurisdiction in which we developed it;\nintegration with partners outside of the United States;\ncompliance by us and our business partners with anti-corruption laws, import and export control laws, tariffs,\ntrade barriers, economic sanctions, and other regulatory limitations on our ability to provide our platform in\ncertain international markets;\nforeign exchange controls that might require significant lead time in setting up operations in certain geographic\nterritories and might prevent us from repatriating cash earned outside the United States;\n25\nTable of Contents\npolitical and economic instability, including as a result of the United Kingdom's (“U.K.”) withdrawal from the\nEuropean Union (“EU”), and other political tensions between countries in which we do business;\nchanges in diplomatic and trade relationships, including the continuing deterioration in diplomatic relations\nbetween the United States and China and the continuing war between Russia and Ukraine, which can and has resulted\nin the imposition of new trade restrictions, trade protection measures, import or export requirements, trade\nembargoes, and other trade barriers;\ngenerally longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable, a risk that may\nincrease as a result of recent macroeconomic conditions, such as high inflation, recessionary environments, and\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, weighing on our customers' ability to pay for our service on a\ntimely basis;\ndouble taxation of our international earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the\nincome and other tax laws of the United States or the international jurisdictions in which we operate, including\nthe imposition of digital services taxes; and\nhigher costs of doing business internationally, including increased accounting, travel, infrastructure, and legal\ncompliance costs.\nAs described above, following Russia’s military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States, European\nUnion, and other nations announced various sanctions against Russia and export restrictions against Russia and\nBelarus. Such restrictions include blocking sanctions on some of the largest state-owned and private Russian\nfinancial institutions, and their removal from the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or\nthe SWIFT, payment system. The invasion of Ukraine and the retaliatory measures that have been taken, and could be\ntaken in future, by the United States, NATO, and other countries have created global security concerns that could\nresult in a regional conflict and otherwise have a lasting impact on regional and global economies, any or all of\nwhich could adversely affect our business, including preventing us from performing existing contracts, pursuing new\nbusiness opportunities, or receiving payments for services already provided to customers.\nCompliance with laws and regulations applicable to our global operations substantially increases our cost of doing\nbusiness in international jurisdictions. We may be unable to keep current with changes in laws and regulations as\nthey occur. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to support compliance with these laws and\nregulations, there can be no assurance that we will always maintain compliance or that all of our employees,\ncontractors, partners, and agents will comply. In addition, legal requirements in the United States and other\ncountries may come into conflict with each other making it challenging or impossible to comply with both countries’\nlegal requirements simultaneously. Any violations could result in enforcement actions, fines, civil and criminal\npenalties, damages, injunctions, or reputational harm. If we are unable to comply with these laws and regulations\nor manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, we may need to relocate or cease operations in\ncertain foreign jurisdictions.\nGeopolitical tension between the United States and China, or between other countries and China, may intensify and\nlead to increased scrutiny of our business operations in China.\nWe have a significant number of employees, primarily engineers, in China, where personnel costs are less expensive\nthan in many other geographies. The number or proportion of our employees in China has fluctuated in the past and\nmay fluctuate in the future due to a number of factors, including macroeconomic changes and internal restructuring.\nGeopolitical and national security tensions between the United States and China, or between other countries and\nChina, have in the past, currently are and could in the future lead to increased scrutiny of our business\noperations in China.\nIn June and July 2020, we received subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the\nEastern District of New York (“EDNY”) and the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern\nDistrict of California (“NDCA”). The EDNY and NDCA subpoenas requested information about (among other things) our\ninteractions with foreign governments and/or foreign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well\nas about storage of and access to user data, including the use of servers based overseas. In addition, the EDNY\nsubpoena requested information about the actions we took relating to videoconference commemorations of the\ncrackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests. The NDCA subpoena also requested documents and\ninformation about (among other things) contacts between our employees and representatives of the Chinese\ngovernment, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in our policies, procedures,\npractices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We are fully cooperating with these\ninvestigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are ongoing,\nand we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the\ninvestigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these\ninvestigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines,\npenalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\n26\nTable of Contents\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. Consequently,\nincreases or decreases in new sales may not be immediately reflected in our results of operations and may be\ndifficult to discern.\nWe recognize revenue from subscriptions to our platform over the terms of these subscriptions. As a result, a\nportion of the revenue we report in each quarter is derived from the recognition of deferred revenue relating to\nsubscriptions entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any\nsingle quarter may have an immaterial impact on the revenue that we recognize for that quarter. However, such a\ndecline will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in\nsales and potential changes in our pricing policies or rate of customer expansion or retention may not be fully\nreflected in our results of operations until future periods. In addition, a significant portion of our costs is\nexpensed as incurred, while revenue is recognized over the term of the subscription. As a result, growth in the\nnumber of new customers and hosts could continue to result in our recognition of higher costs and lower revenue in\nthe earlier periods of our subscriptions. Finally, our subscription-based revenue model also makes it difficult for\nus to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new customers or from\nexisting customers that increase their use of our platform or upgrade to a higher-priced tier of Zoom Meeting plan\nmust be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nAny failure to offer high-quality support for our customers and hosts may harm our relationships with our customers\nand hosts and, consequently, our business.\nIncreased user demand for support, may result in increased costs that may harm our results of operations. For\nexample, during the COVID-19 pandemic we saw surging demand requiring us to allocate additional resources to\nsupport our expanded user base, including many hosts and customers who are using our platform for the first time.\nIn addition, as we continue to grow our operations and support our global user base, we need to be able to continue\nto provide efficient support that meets our customers and hosts’ needs globally at scale. As the number of our\nusers has grown significantly, it has put additional pressure on our support organization. If we are unable to\nprovide efficient user support globally at scale or if we need to hire additional support personnel, our business\nmay be harmed. Our new customer and host signups are highly dependent on our business reputation and on\nrecommendations from our existing customers and hosts. Any failure to maintain high-quality support, or a market\nperception that we do not maintain high-quality support for our customers and hosts, would harm our business.\nWe utilize our network of resellers to sell our products and services, and our failure to effectively develop,\nmanage, and maintain our indirect sales channels would harm our business.\nOur future success depends on our continued ability to establish and maintain a network of channel relationships,\nand we expect that we will need to maintain and expand our network as we expand into international markets. A small\nportion of our revenue is derived from our network of sales agents and resellers, which we refer to collectively as\nresellers, many of which sell or may in the future decide to sell their own products and services or services from\nother communications solutions providers. Loss of or reduction in sales through these third parties could reduce\nour revenue. Our competitors may in some cases be effective in causing our reseller or potential reseller to favor\ntheir products and services or prevent or reduce sales of our products and services. Recruiting and retaining\nqualified resellers in our network and training them in our technology and product offerings requires significant\ntime and resources. If we decide to further develop and expand our indirect sales channels, we must continue to\nscale and improve our processes and procedures to support these channels, including investment in systems and\ntraining. Many resellers may not be willing to invest the time and resources required to train their staff to\neffectively sell our platform. If we fail to maintain relationships with our resellers, fail to develop\nrelationships with new resellers in new markets, or expand the number of resellers in existing markets or fail to\nmanage, train, or provide appropriate incentives to our existing resellers, our ability to increase the number of\nnew customers and hosts and increase sales to existing customers could be adversely impacted, which would harm our\nbusiness.\nOur results of operations, which are reported in U.S. dollars, could be adversely affected if currency exchange\nrates fluctuate substantially in the future.\nWe sell to customers globally and have international operations primarily in Australia, China, and the U.K. As we\ncontinue to expand our international operations, we have become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in\ncurrency exchange rates. Although the majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, a\nportion of our revenue is denominated in foreign currencies, and our expenses are generally denominated in the\ncurrencies of the jurisdictions in which we conduct our operations. For the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021, 20.0%, 22.6%, and 20.2% of our revenue, respectively, and 10.8%, 16.8%, and 11.9% of our expenses,\nrespectively, were denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollars. Because we conduct business in currencies\nother than U.S. dollars but report our results of operations in U.S. dollars, we also face remeasurement exposure\nto fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which could hinder our ability to predict our future results and\nearnings and could materially impact our results of operations. For example, for the year ended\n27\nTable of Contents\nJanuary 31, 2023, our total revenue was lower than anticipated in part due to the strengthening of the U.S dollar.\nWe do not currently maintain a program to hedge exposures to non-U.S. dollar currencies.\nOur sales to government entities and other government contractors are subject to a number of additional challenges\nand risks.\nWe expect to continue selling our products and services to U.S. federal and state and foreign governmental agency\ncustomers, which may occur through sales to other companies that re-sell our services to government customers\nand/or through direct sales to government entities. While we are a U.S. Federal Risk and Authorization Management\nProgram (“FedRAMP”) authorized SaaS service, selling to government entities and other government contractors\npresent a number of unique challenges and risk including the following:\nselling to governmental entities can be more competitive, expensive, and time-consuming than selling to private\nentities, often requiring significant up-front time and expense and ongoing compliance costs without any assurance\nthat these efforts will generate a sale;\ngovernment certification requirements may change, or we may be unable to achieve or sustain one or more\ngovernment certifications, including FedRAMP, which may restrict our ability to sell into the government sector\nuntil we have attained such certificates;\ncontracts with governmental entities and other government contractors, including resellers in the government\nmarket, contain terms that differ less favorably from what we generally agree to in our standard agreements,\nincluding, terms and conditions required by regulation that are not negotiable with the customer;\nnon-compliance with terms and conditions of government contracts, or with representations or certifications made\nin connection with government contracts, can result in significantly more adverse consequences than we typically\nwould expect in the commercial market, including, depending on the circumstances, criminal liability, liability\nunder the civil False Claims Act, and/or suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental entities;\ngovernment demand and payment for our products may be influenced, among other things, by public sector budgetary\ncycles and funding authorizations, with funding reductions or delays having an adverse impact on public sector\ndemand for our products; and\ngovernment-imposed vaccine mandates could result in increased attrition and difficulties in recruiting, and non-\ncompliance with any such mandates could restrict our ability to do business with governmental entities.\nTo the extent that we become more reliant on contracts with government entities and/or other government contractors\nin the future, our exposure to such risks and challenges could increase, which in turn could adversely impact our\nbusiness.\nIn May 2021, the Biden Administration issued an Executive Order requiring federal agencies to implement additional\ninformation technology security measures, including, among other things, requiring agencies to adopt multifactor\nauthentication and encryption for data at rest and in transit to the maximum extent consistent with Federal records\nlaws and other applicable laws. The Executive Order will lead to the development of secure software development\npractices and/or criteria for a consumer software labeling program, which will reflect a baseline level of secure\npractices, for software that is developed and sold to the U.S. federal government. Software developers will be\nrequired to provide visibility into their software and make security data publicly available. Due to this Executive\nOrder, federal agencies may require us to modify our cybersecurity practices and policies, thereby increasing our\ncompliance costs. If we are unable to meet the requirements of the Executive Order, our ability to work with the\nU.S. government may be impaired and may result in a loss of revenue.\nOur current platform, as well as products, features, and functionality that we may introduce in the future, may not\nbe widely accepted by our customers and hosts or may receive negative attention or may require us to compensate or\nreimburse third parties, any of which may lower our margins and harm our business.\nOur ability to engage, retain, and increase our base of customers and hosts and to increase our revenue will depend\non our ability to successfully create new products, features, and functionality, both independently and together\nwith third parties. We may introduce significant changes to our existing platform or develop and introduce new and\nunproven products, including technologies with which we have little or no prior development or operating\nexperience. These new products and updates may not perform as expected, may fail to engage, retain, and increase\nour base of customers and hosts or may create lag in adoption of such new products. New products may initially\nsuffer from performance and quality issues that may negatively impact our ability to market and sell such products\nto new and existing customers and hosts. The short- and long-term impact of any major change to our platform, or\nthe introduction of new products, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage,\nretain, and increase our base of customers and hosts, or do not perform as expected, we may fail to generate\nsufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments in such products, any of which may\nharm our business in the short term, long term, or both. In addition, our current platform as well as products,\nfeatures, and functionality\n28\nTable of Contents\nthat we may introduce in the future, may require us to compensate or reimburse third parties. For example, our\ncloud phone system, Zoom Phone, is a PBX phone solution that requires us to compensate carriers that operate the\nPSTN. As a result, a portion of the payments that we will receive from customers that will use our Zoom Phone\nproduct will be allocated towards compensating these telephone carriers, which lowers our margins for Zoom Phone as\ncompared to our other products. In addition, new products that we introduce in the future may similarly require us\nto compensate or reimburse third parties, all of which would lower our profit margins for any such new products. If\nthis trend continues with our new and existing products, including Zoom Phone, it could harm our business.\nIf we experience excessive fraudulent activity or cannot meet evolving credit card association merchant standards,\nwe could incur substantial costs and lose the right to accept credit cards for payment, which could cause our\ncustomer and paid host base to decline significantly.\nA large portion of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card accounts directly for our products. If\ncustomers pay for their subscriptions with stolen credit cards, we could incur substantial third-party vendor costs\nfor which we may not be reimbursed. Further, our customers provide us with credit card billing information online\nor over the phone, and we do not review the physical credit cards used in these transactions, which increases our\nrisk of exposure to fraudulent activity. We also incur charges, which we refer to as chargebacks, from the credit\ncard companies for claims that the customer did not authorize the credit card transaction for our products,\nsomething that we have experienced in the past. If the number of claims of unauthorized credit card transactions\nbecomes excessive, we could be assessed substantial fines for excess chargebacks, and we could lose the right to\naccept credit cards for payment. In addition, credit card issuers may change merchant standards, including data\nprotection and documentation standards, required to utilize their services from time to time. If we fail to\nmaintain compliance with current merchant standards or fail to meet new standards, the credit card associations\ncould fine us or terminate their agreements with us, and we would be unable to accept credit cards as payment for\nour products. Our products may also be subject to fraudulent usage and schemes, including third parties accessing\ncustomer accounts or viewing and recording data from our communications solutions. These fraudulent activities can\nresult in unauthorized access to customer accounts and data, unauthorized use of our products, and charges and\nexpenses to customers for fraudulent usage. We may be required to pay for these charges and expenses with no\nreimbursement from the customer, and our reputation may be harmed if our products are subject to fraudulent usage.\nAlthough we implement multiple fraud prevention and detection controls, we cannot assure you that these controls\nwill be adequate to protect against fraud. Substantial losses due to fraud or our inability to accept credit card\npayments would cause our customer base to significantly decrease and would harm our business.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities, which could harm our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside of the United States. Our\neffective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the proportion of our earnings in countries with differing\nstatutory tax rates. Our tax expense could also be impacted by changes in non-deductible expenses; changes in\nexcess tax benefits of stock-based compensation expense; changes in the valuation of, or our ability to use,\ndeferred tax assets; the applicability of withholding taxes; and effects from acquisitions.\nThe provision for taxes on our consolidated financial statements could also be impacted by changes in accounting\nprinciples; changes in U.S. federal, state, or foreign tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals (including\nprovisions of the recently enacted federal tax legislation titled the Inflation Reduction Act); other fundamental\nchanges in tax law currently being considered by many countries; and changes in taxing jurisdictions’\nadministrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions. In addition, we are subject to review and audit\nby U.S. federal, state, local, and foreign tax authorities. Such tax authorities may disagree with tax positions we\ntake, and if any such tax authority were to successfully challenge any such position, our business could be\nadversely impacted.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 requires the capitalization and amortization of research and development expenses\neffective for years beginning after December 31, 2021. The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our cash\ntax liabilities but also decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income\ndeduction. There is a possibility that Congress will defer, repeal, or otherwise modify this requirement in future\nperiods. Absent a change in legislation, we expect it will have a material impact on our cash flows beginning the\ncurrent fiscal year ending January 31, 2023.\nWe may also be subject to additional tax liabilities due to changes in non-income-based taxes resulting from\nchanges in U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign tax laws; changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative\ninterpretations, decisions, policies, and positions; results of tax examinations, settlements, or judicial\ndecisions; changes in accounting principles, changes to our business operations, including acquisitions; as well as\nthe evaluation of new information that results in a change to a tax position taken in a prior period. Further, the\nOrganization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) and the Inclusive Framework of G20 and other\ncountries have issued proposals related to the taxation of the digital economy. In addition, several countries have\nproposed or enacted Digital Services Taxes (“DST”), many of which would apply to revenue\n29\nTable of Contents\nderived from digital services. Future developments related to such proposals, in particular any unilateral actions\noutside of the OECD's Inclusive Framework such as the imposition of DST rules, could have an adverse impact on our\nbusiness by increasing our future tax obligations.\nWe have acquired and may continue to acquire other businesses or receive offers to be acquired, which could require\nsignificant management attention, disrupt our business, or dilute stockholder value.\nWe have made and may continue in the future to make acquisitions of other companies, products, and technologies. We\nhave limited experience in acquisitions. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates and we may not\nbe able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not\nultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be\nviewed negatively by users, developers, or investors. In addition, we may not be able to integrate acquired\nbusinesses successfully or effectively manage the combined company following an acquisition. If we fail to\nsuccessfully integrate our acquisitions, or the people or technologies associated with those acquisitions, into our\ncompany, the results of operations of the combined company could be adversely affected. Any integration process\nwill require significant time and resources, require significant attention from management and disrupt the ordinary\nfunctioning of our business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully, which could harm our\nbusiness. In addition, we may not successfully evaluate or utilize the acquired technology and accurately forecast\nthe financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including accounting charges.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt, or issue equity securities to pay for any such acquisition, each of which\ncould affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. The sale of equity to finance any such\nacquisitions could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt, it would result in increased\nfixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to\nflexibly operate our business.\nWe have a limited operating history at the current scale of our business, which makes it difficult to evaluate our\nprospects and future results of operations.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we experienced rapid growth in usage of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This usage dramatically changed the scale of our business, and we\nhave a limited operating history at the current scale of our business. As a result, our ability to forecast our\nfuture results of operations is limited and subject to a number of uncertainties, including our ability to plan for\nand model future growth and expenses. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our\nfuture performance. Further, in future periods, our revenue growth could continue to slow or our revenue could\ndecline for a number of reasons, including any reduction in demand for our platform; increased competition;\ncontraction of our overall market; our inability to accurately forecast demand for our platform and plan for\ncapacity constraints; or our failure, for any reason, to capitalize on growth opportunities or to adapt and respond\nto inflationary factors affecting our business or future economic recession. The changes the COVID-19 pandemic\nfostered on the way companies operate, including the shifts to remote and hybrid work have limited our ability to\nforecast revenue, costs, and expenses due to the uncertainty around how companies choose to operate in the future,\nincluding the impacts of a remote and hybrid workplace. We have encountered and will encounter risks and\nuncertainties frequently experienced by growing companies in rapidly changing industries, such as the risks and\nuncertainties described herein. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties, which we use to plan\nour business, are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our business would be\nharmed.\nWe rely on data from tools to calculate certain of our key business metrics. Real or perceived inaccuracies in such\nmetrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track our key business metrics with tools that are not independently verified by any third party. Our tools have\nlimitations, and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in\nunexpected changes to our performance metrics, including the key metrics we report. If the tools we use to track\nthese metrics over- or undercount performance or contain errors, the data we report may not be accurate and our\nunderstanding of certain details of our business may be distorted, which could affect our longer-term strategies.\nWe are continually seeking to improve our ability to measure our key business metrics, and regularly review our\nprocesses to assess potential improvements.\n30\nTable of Contents\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nThe actual or perceived failure by us, our customers, partners, or vendors to comply with stringent and evolving\nprivacy, data protection, and information security laws, regulations, standards, policies, and contractual\nobligations could harm our reputation and business or subject us to significant fines and liability.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect, receive, store, process, generate, use, transfer, disclose, make\naccessible, protect, secure, dispose of, transmit, and share confidential, proprietary, and sensitive information,\nincluding personal information, customer and user content, business data, trade secrets, intellectual property,\nthird-party data, business plans, transactions, financial information Our data processing activities may subject us\nto numerous privacy, data protection, and information security obligations, such as various laws, regulations,\nguidance, industry standards, external and internal privacy and security policies, and contractual requirements.\nFor example, in June 2020, we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s\nOffice for the EDNY, which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and foreign\npolitical parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access to user\ndata, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to\nvideoconference commemorations of the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests. In July 2020, we\nreceived subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the NDCA and the SEC. Both subpoenas\nseek documents and information relating to various security, data protection and privacy matters, including our\nencryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage metrics and related public\nstatements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts between our employees and\nrepresentatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by any foreign government in\nour policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United States. We have since\nreceived additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully cooperating with all of\nthese investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation. These investigations are\nongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately discover as a result of the\ninvestigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict the outcome of these\ninvestigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur substantial fines,\npenalties, or other financial exposure, as well as material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence and business, additional expenses, and other harm to our business.\nIn the United States, federal, state, and local governments have enacted numerous privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security laws, including data breach notification laws, personal data privacy laws, consumer protection\nlaws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), and other similar laws (e.g., wiretapping laws). For\nexample, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”) applies to personal information of consumers,\nbusiness representatives, and employees, and requires businesses to provide specific disclosures in privacy notices\nand honor requests of California residents to exercise certain privacy rights. The CCPA provides for civil\npenalties of up to $7,500 per violation and allows private litigants affected by certain data breaches to recover\nsignificant statutory damages. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 (“CPRA”) expands the CCPA’s\nrequirements, including by adding a new right for individuals to correct their personal information and\nestablishing a new regulatory agency to implement and enforce the law. In addition, effective October 1, 2019,\nNevada amended its existing Security of Personal Information Law (“SPI Law”) to now require, among other things,\nthat businesses provide an online mechanism or toll-free phone number to intake requests from consumers to opt out\nof the sale of their personal information. Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut have similarly enacted\ncomprehensive privacy, data protection and information security laws, that emulate the CCPA and CPRA in many\nrespects and have taken or will take effect in 2023. These developments may further complicate compliance efforts\nand increase legal risk and compliance costs for us and the third parties upon whom we rely. Under various laws and\nother obligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, we may be required to obtain\ncertain consents to process personal information. Our inability or failure to do so could result in adverse\nconsequences.\nOutside the United States, an increasing number of laws, regulations, and industry standards may govern related to\nprivacy, data protection, and information security. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection\nRegulation (“EU GDPR”), the United Kingdom’s GDPR (“UK GDPR”), Brazil’s General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de\nProteção de Dados Pessoais, or “LGPD”) (Law No. 13,709/2018), and China’s Personal Information Protection Law\n(“PIPL”) impose strict requirements for processing personal information. For example, under the EU GDPR, companies\nmay face temporary or definitive bans on data processing and other corrective actions; fines of up to 20 million\nEuros or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is greater; or private litigation related to processing of personal\ninformation brought by classes of data subjects or consumer protection organizations authorized at law to represent\ntheir interests.\nWe also target customers in Asia and have operations in Japan and Singapore, and may be subject to new and emerging\nprivacy, data protection, and information security regimes in Asia, including Japan’s Act on the Protection of\nPersonal Information and Singapore’s Personal Data Protection Act.\n31\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, we may be unable to transfer personal information from Europe and other jurisdictions to the United\nStates or other countries due to data localization requirements or limitations on cross-border data flows. Europe\nand other jurisdictions have enacted laws requiring data to be localized or limiting the transfer of personal\ninformation to other countries. In particular, the European Economic Area (“EEA”) and the United Kingdom (“UK”)\nhave significantly restricted the transfer of personal information to the United States and other countries whose\nprivacy laws they believe are inadequate. Other jurisdictions may adopt similarly stringent interpretations of\ntheir data localization and cross-border data transfer laws. Although there are currently various mechanisms that\nmay be used to transfer personal information from the EEA and UK to the United States in compliance with law, such\nas the EEA and UK’s standard contractual clauses, these mechanisms are subject to legal challenges, and there is no\nassurance that we can satisfy or rely on these measures to lawfully transfer personal information to the United\nStates.\nIf there is no lawful manner for us to transfer personal information from the EEA, the UK, or other jurisdictions\nto the United States, or if the requirements for a legally-compliant transfer are too onerous, we could face\nsignificant adverse consequences, including the interruption or degradation of our operations, the need to relocate\npart of or all of our business or data processing activities to other jurisdictions at significant expense,\nincreased exposure to regulatory actions, substantial fines and penalties, the inability to transfer data and work\nwith partners, vendors and other third parties, and injunctions against our processing or transferring of personal\ninformation necessary to operate our business. Additionally, companies that transfer personal information out of\nthe EEA and UK to other jurisdictions, particularly to the United States, are subject to increased scrutiny from\nregulators, individual litigants, and activities groups. Some European regulators have ordered certain companies to\nsuspend or permanently cease certain transfers of personal information out of Europe for allegedly violating the\nGDPR’s cross-border data transfer limitations.\nFurthermore, several states and localities have enacted measures related to the use of artificial intelligence and\nmachine learning in products and services. For example, in Europe, there is a proposed regulation related to\nartificial intelligence (“AI”) that, if adopted, could impose onerous obligations related to the use of AI-related\nsystems. We may have to change our business practices to comply with such obligations.\nAdditionally, regulators are increasingly scrutinizing companies that process children’s data. Numerous laws,\nregulations, and legally-binding codes, such as the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”),\nCalifornia’s Age Appropriate Design Code (effective in July 2024), the CCPA and CPRA, other U.S. state\ncomprehensive privacy laws, the EU and UK GDPR, and the UK Age Appropriate Design Code, impose various obligations\non companies that process children’s data, including by requiring certain consents to process such data and\nextending certain rights to children and their parents with respect that data. Some of these obligations have wide\nranging applications, including for services that do not intentionally target child users (defined in some\ncircumstances as a user under the age of 18 years old). In particular, COPPA is a U.S. Federal law that applies to\noperators of commercial websites and online services directed to U.S. children under the age of 13 that collect\npersonal information from children, and to operators of general audience websites with actual knowledge that they\nare collecting personal information from U.S. children under the age of 13. We provide video communications and\ncollaboration services to schools, school districts, and school systems to support traditional, virtual, and hybrid\nclassrooms, distance learning, educational office hours, guest lectures, and other services. As part of these\nservices, Zoom may be used by students, including students under the age of 13, and we collect personal information\nfrom such students on behalf of our school subscribers. School subscribers must contractually consent to Zoom’s\ninformation practices on behalf of students, prior to students using the services. If we fail to accurately\nanticipate the application, interpretation, or legislative expansion of applicable privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security laws, we could be subject to governmental enforcement actions, data processing restrictions,\nlitigation, fines and penalties, adverse publicity or loss of customers. Moreover, as a result of any such\nfailures, we could be in breach of our K-12 school customer contracts, and our customers could lose trust in us,\nwhich could harm our reputation and business.\nIndividuals are increasingly resistant to the collection, use, and sharing of personal information to deliver\ntargeted advertising. Third-party platforms have introduced (or plan to introduce) measures to provide users with\nmore privacy controls over targeted advertising activities, and regulators (including in the EEA/UK) are heavily\nscrutinizing the use of technologies used to deliver such advertisements. Major technology platforms on which we\nrely to gather information about consumers have adopted or proposed measures to provide consumers with additional\ncontrol over the collection, use, and sharing of their personal data for targeted advertising or other purposes. In\naddition, legislative proposals and present laws and regulations regulate the use of cookies and other tracking\ntechnologies, electronic communications, and marketing. For example, in the EEA and the UK, regulators are\nincreasingly focusing on compliance with requirements related to the targeted advertising ecosystem. European\nregulators have issued significant fines in certain circumstances where the regulators alleged that appropriate\nconsent was not obtained in connection with targeted advertising activities. It is anticipated that the ePrivacy\nRegulation and national implementing laws will replace the current national laws implementing the ePrivacy\nDirective, which may require us to make significant operational changes. In the United States, the CCPA, for\nexample, grants California residents the right to opt-out of a company’s sharing of personal data for advertising\npurposes in exchange for money or other valuable consideration, and requires covered businesses to honor user-\nenabled browser signals from the Global Privacy Control.\n32\nTable of Contents\nPartially as a result of these developments, individuals are becoming increasingly resistant to the collection,\nuse, and sharing of personal information to deliver targeted advertising or other types of tracking. Individuals\nare now more aware of options related to consent, “do not track” mechanisms (such as browser signals from the\nGlobal Privacy Control), and “ad-blocking” software to prevent the collection of their personal information for\ntargeted advertising purposes. As a result, we may be required to change the way we market our products, and any of\nthese developments or changes could materially impair our ability to reach new or existing customers or otherwise\nnegatively affect our operations.\nIn addition to data privacy and security laws, we are contractually subject to industry standards adopted by\nindustry groups and may become subject to such obligations in the future. We are also bound by other contractual\nobligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security, and our efforts to comply with such\nobligations may not be successful. We publish privacy policies, marketing materials, and other statements, such as\ncompliance with certain certifications or self-regulatory principles, regarding privacy, data protection, and\ninformation security privacy, data protection, and information security. If these policies, materials or statements\nare found to be deficient, lacking in transparency, deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our practices, we\nmay be subject to investigation, enforcement actions by regulators, or other adverse consequences.\nObligations related to privacy, data protection, and information security are quickly changing, becoming\nincreasingly stringent, and creating regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, these obligations may be subject to\ndiffering applications and interpretations, which may be inconsistent or conflict among jurisdictions. Preparing\nfor and complying with these obligations requires us to devote significant resources and may necessitate changes to\nour services, information technologies, systems, and practices and to those of any third parties that process\npersonal information on our behalf.\nWe may at times fail (or be perceived to have failed) in our efforts to comply with our privacy, data protection,\nand information security obligations. Moreover, despite our efforts, our personnel or third parties on whom we rely\nmay fail to comply with such obligations, which could negatively impact our business operations. If we or the third\nparties on which we rely fail, or are perceived to have failed, to address or comply with applicable privacy, data\nprotection, and information security obligations, we could face significant consequences, including but not limited\nto: government enforcement actions (e.g., investigations, fines, penalties, audits, inspections, and similar);\nlitigation (including class-action claims); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; bans on processing\npersonal information; and orders to destroy or not use personal information. Any of these events could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our reputation, business, or financial condition, including but not limited to: loss of\ncustomers; inability to process personal information or to operate in certain jurisdictions; limited ability to\ndevelop or commercialize our products; expenditure of time and resources to defend any claim or inquiry; adverse\npublicity; or substantial changes to our business model or operations.\nWe have in the past and may in the future receive inquiries or be subject to investigations by domestic and\ninternational government entities regarding, among other things, our privacy, data protection, and information\nsecurity practices. The result of these proceedings could impact our brand reputation, subject us to monetary\nremedies and costs, interrupt or require us to change our business practices, divert resources and the attention of\nmanagement from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business. We also face\nlitigation regarding our privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with third parties, in\nvarious jurisdictions. See Part I, Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” for additional information.\nWe were also the subject of an investigation by the FTC relating to our privacy and security representations and\npractices. We have reached a settlement agreement with the FTC, which the FTC voted to make final on January 19,\n2021. We could fail or be perceived to fail to comply with the terms of the settlement with the FTC or any other\norders or settlements relating to litigation or governmental investigations with respect to our privacy and\nsecurity practices. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with such orders or settlements may increase the\npossibility of additional adverse consequences, including litigation, additional regulatory actions, injunctions,\nor monetary penalties, or require further changes to our business practices, significant management time, or the\ndiversion of significant operational resources. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens\nimposed by, the laws, regulations, policies, and other obligations that are applicable to the businesses of our\nusers may limit the adoption and use of, and reduce the overall demand for, our platform and services, which could\nhave an adverse impact on our business.\nAdditionally, we rely on the administrators of our customers in the healthcare and education industries to obtain\nthe necessary consents from users of our products and services and to ensure their account settings are configured\ncorrectly for their compliance under applicable laws and regulations, including HIPAA. Furthermore, if third\nparties we work with, such as vendors or developers, make misrepresentations, violate applicable laws and\nregulations, or our policies, such misrepresentations and violations may also put our users’ content at risk and\ncould in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Any significant change to applicable laws, regulations, or\nindustry practices regarding the collection, use, retention, security, or disclosure of our users’ content, or\nregarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of users for the collection, use, retention, or\ndisclosure of such content is obtained, could increase our costs and require us to modify our\n33\nTable of Contents\nservices and features, possibly in a material manner, which we may be unable to complete and may limit our ability\nto store and process user data or provide or develop new services and features.\nIncreased usage of our services and additional awareness of Zoom and our brand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic\nhas led to greater public scrutiny of, press related to, or a negative perception of our collection, use, storage,\ndisclosure, and processing of personal information, and our privacy policies and practices. For example, users and\ncustomers, particularly those that are new to Zoom, may not have significant IT or security knowledge or have their\nown IT controls like those of a larger organization to configure our service in a manner that provides them with\ncontrol over user settings. This has resulted in reports of users and customers experiencing meeting disruptions by\nmalicious actors. Additional unfavorable publicity and scrutiny has led to increased governmental and regulatory\nscrutiny and litigation exposure, and could result in material reputational harm, a loss of customer and user\nconfidence, additional expenses and other harm to our business.\nChanges in government trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs and export restrictions, could limit our\nability to sell our products to certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of\noperations.\nThe U.S. or foreign governments may take administrative, legislative, or regulatory action that could materially\ninterfere with our ability to sell products in certain countries. For example, while we stopped selling our\nproducts directly in China during the six months ended July 31, 2020, the prior U.S. administration had threatened\ntougher trade terms with China and other countries, leading to the imposition, or announcement of future\nimposition, of substantially higher U.S. Section 301 tariffs on roughly $500 billion of imports from China. In\nresponse, China imposed and proposed new or higher tariffs on U.S. products. The direct and indirect effects of\ntariffs and other restrictive trade policies are difficult to measure and are only one part of a larger U.S./China\neconomic and trade policy disagreement. The effects of tariffs are uncertain because of the dynamic nature of\ngovernmental action and responses. Sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions\nand further escalation of trade tensions between the United States and its trading partners, especially China,\ncould result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade, including retaliatory trade\nrestrictions that restrict our ability to operate in China. We cannot predict what actions may ultimately be taken\nby the new U.S. administration with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the United States and China or\nother countries, what products may be subject to such actions, or what actions may be taken by the other countries\nin retaliation. Any further deterioration in the relations between the United States and China could exacerbate\nthese actions and other governmental intervention. For example, the implementation of China’s national-security law\nin Hong Kong has created additional U.S.-China tensions and could potentially increase the risks associated with\nthe business and operations of U.S.-based technology companies in China. Any alterations to our business strategy\nor operations made in order to adapt to or comply with any such changes would be time-consuming and expensive, and\ncertain of our competitors may be better suited to withstand or react to these changes.\nFurther, in recent years, the U.S. Government has expressed concerns with the security of information and\ncommunications technology and services (“ICTS”) sourced from providers in China, Russia, and other jurisdictions.\nIn May 2019, former President Trump issued an executive order that invoked national emergency economic powers to\nimplement a framework to regulate the acquisition or transfer of ICTS in transactions that imposed undue national\nsecurity risks. The executive order is subject to implementation by the Secretary of Commerce and applies to\ncontracts entered into prior to the effective date of the order. On March 22, 2021, the U.S. Department of Commerce\nissued an interim final rule allowing it to identify, review, and prohibit ICTS transactions that pose a national\nsecurity risk, including transactions involving specified countries, such as China. Several aspects of this rule\nremain unclear including the scope of affected transactions and how the rule will be implemented and enforced in\npractice. In addition, the U.S. Commerce Department has implemented additional restrictions and may implement\nfurther restrictions that would affect conducting business with certain Chinese companies. Due to the uncertainty\nregarding the timing, content, and extent of any such changes in policy, we cannot assure you that we will\nsuccessfully mitigate any negative impact. Depending upon their duration and implementation, these tariffs, the\nexecutive order and its implementation, and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business,\nincluding in the form of increased cost of revenue, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced\nsales.\n34\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to additional liabilities on past sales for taxes, surcharges, and fees.\nWe currently collect and remit applicable indirect taxes in jurisdictions where we, through our employees, have a\npresence and where we have determined, based on legal precedents in the jurisdiction, that sales of our platform\nare classified as taxable. State and local taxing authorities have differing rules and regulations which are\nsubject to varying interpretations. This makes the applicability of sales tax to e-commerce businesses, such as\nours, uncertain and complex. We believe that we are not otherwise subject to, or required to collect, additional\ntaxes, fees, or surcharges imposed by state and local jurisdictions because we do not have a sufficient physical\npresence or “nexus” in the relevant taxing jurisdiction, or such taxes, fees, or surcharges do not apply to sales\nof our platform in the relevant taxing jurisdiction. There is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient nexus\nfor sales made over the Internet and, after the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in South Dakota v. Wayfair, states may\nrequire an e-commerce business with no in-state property or personnel to collect and remit sales tax. Therefore, it\nis possible that we could face future audits or challenges of our positions by taxing authorities and that our\nliability for these taxes could exceed our estimates. The application of existing, new, or future laws, whether in\nthe U.S. or internationally, could harm our business.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls that could impair our ability to compete in international\nmarkets due to licensing requirements and subject us to liability if we are not in compliance with applicable laws.\nOur platform and associated products are subject to various restrictions under U.S. export control and sanctions\nlaws and regulations, including the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”) and\nvarious economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of\nForeign Assets Control (“OFAC”). The U.S. export control laws and U.S. economic sanctions laws include restrictions\nor prohibitions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to U.S.-embargoed or U.S.-sanctioned\ncountries, governments, persons, and entities, and also require authorization for the export of certain encryption\nitems. In addition, various countries regulate the import of certain encryption technology, including through\nimport permitting and licensing requirements and have enacted or could enact laws that could limit our ability to\ndistribute our platform or could limit our hosts’ ability to implement our platform in those countries.\nAlthough we have taken precautions to prevent our platform and associated products from being accessed or used in\nviolation of such laws, we have inadvertently allowed our platform and associated products to be accessed or used\nby some customers in potential violation of U.S. economic sanction laws. In addition, we may have inadvertently\nmade our software products available to some customers in potential violation of the EAR. As a result, we have\nsubmitted and from time to time will continue to submit as warranted voluntary self-disclosures regarding our\ncompliance with U.S. sanctions and export control laws and regulations to OFAC and the U.S. Department of\nCommerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security (“BIS”). For instance, since March 2022, we have submitted certain\nreports to BIS detailing the findings from a review of our compliance with certain U.S. export control laws and\nregulations.\nIf we are found to be in violation of U.S. economic sanctions or export control laws in the future, it could result\nin fines and penalties. We may also be adversely affected through other penalties, business disruption,\nreputational harm, loss of access to certain markets, or otherwise. While we are working to implement additional\ncontrols designed to prevent similar activity from occurring in the future, these controls may not be fully\neffective.\nChanges in our platform, or changes in export, sanctions, and import laws, may delay the introduction and sale of\nsubscriptions to our platform in international markets; prevent our customers with international operations from\nusing our platform; or, in some cases, prevent the access or use of our platform to and from certain countries,\ngovernments, persons, or entities altogether. Further, any change in export or import regulations, economic\nsanctions or related laws, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations or change in the countries,\ngovernments, persons, or technologies targeted by such regulations could result in decreased use of our platform or\nin our decreased ability to export or sell our platform to existing or potential customers with international\noperations. Any decreased use of our platform or limitation on our ability to export or sell our platform would\nlikely harm our business.\n35\nTable of Contents\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, a variety of U.S. and international laws that\ncould result in claims, increase the cost of operations or otherwise harm our business due to changes in the laws,\nchanges in the interpretations of the laws, greater enforcement of the laws, or investigations into compliance with\nthe laws.\nWe may be subject to, or assist law enforcement with enforcement of, various laws, including those covering\ncopyright, indecent content, child protection, consumer protection, telecommunications services, taxation, and\nsimilar matters. It may be difficult, expensive, and disruptive for us to address law enforcement requests,\nsubpoenas and other legal process, and laws in various jurisdictions may conflict and hamper our ability to satisfy\nor comply with such requests, subpoenas and other legal process. There have been instances where improper or\nillegal content has been shared on our platform without our knowledge. As a service provider and as a matter of\npolicy, we do not monitor user meetings. However, to ensure user safety and prevent conduct that is illegal,\nviolent, or harmful to others, we enforce our terms of service through use of a mix of tools that suggest when such\nactivity may be occurring on our platform. We also recently created an in-product security feature that allows the\nhost or co-host of a meeting to easily select a meeting participant that may be engaging in illegal or harmful\nbehavior and send a report about that behavior to our trust and safety team for evaluation. Our trust and safety\nteam may take further action as appropriate, including suspension or termination of the participant's account or\nreferral to law enforcement. While to date we have not been subject to material legal or administrative actions as\na result of improper or illegal content, the laws in this area are currently in a state of flux and vary widely\nbetween jurisdictions. Accordingly, it may be possible that in the future we and our competitors may be subject to\nlegal actions along with the users who shared such content. In addition, regardless of any legal liability we may\nface, our reputation could be harmed should there be an incident generating extensive negative publicity about the\ncontent shared on our platform. Such publicity would harm our business.\nWe are also subject to consumer protection laws that may affect our sales and marketing efforts, including laws\nrelated to subscriptions, billing, and auto-renewal. These laws, as well as any changes in these laws, could\nadversely affect our self-serve model and make it more difficult for us to retain and upgrade customers and attract\nnew customers and hosts. Additionally, we have in the past, are currently, and may from time to time in the future\nbecome the subject of inquiries and other actions by regulatory authorities as a result of our business practices,\nincluding our subscription, billing, and auto-renewal policies. Consumer protection laws may be interpreted or\napplied by regulatory authorities in a manner that could require us to make changes to our operations or incur\nfines, penalties, or settlement expenses, which may result in harm to our business.\nOur platform depends on the ability of our customers, hosts, and users to access the internet, and our platform has\nbeen blocked or restricted in some countries for various reasons. If we fail to anticipate developments in the law,\nor fail for any reason to comply with relevant law, our platform could be further blocked or restricted, and we\ncould be exposed to significant liability that could harm our business.\nWe are also subject to various U.S. and international anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt\nPractices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”), and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, as well as other similar anti-\nbribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations. These laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their\nemployees and intermediaries, from directly or indirectly authorizing, offering, or providing improper payments or\nbenefits to government officials and other recipients for improper purposes. The FCPA also requires public\ncompanies to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect the transactions of the corporation\nand to device and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Although we take precautions to\nprevent violations of anti-corruption laws, our exposure for violating these laws increases as we continue to\nexpand our international presence, and any failure to comply with such laws could harm our business, financial\ncondition, and results of operations.\nZoom Phone is subject to U.S. federal and international regulation, and other products we may introduce in the\nfuture may also be subject to U.S. federal, state, or international laws, rules, and regulations. Any failure to\ncomply with such laws, rules, and regulations could harm our business and expose us to liability.\nFederal Regulation\nZoom Phone is provided through our wholly owned subsidiary, Zoom Voice Communications, Inc., which is regulated by\nthe FCC as an interconnected voice over internet protocol (“VoIP”) service provider. As a result, Zoom Phone is\nsubject to existing or potential FCC regulations, including, but not limited to, regulations relating to privacy,\ndisability access, porting of numbers, federal Universal Service Fund (“USF”), contributions and other regulatory\nassessments, emergency calling/Enhanced 911 (“E-911”), access charges for long distance services, and law\nenforcement access. Congress or the FCC may expand the scope of Zoom Phone’s regulatory obligations at any time. In\naddition, FCC classification of Zoom Phone as a common carrier or telecommunications service could result in\nadditional federal and state regulatory obligations. If we do not comply with any current or future state\nregulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may have to\nrestructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which could\nultimately harm our business and results of operations. Any enforcement action by the FCC, which may be a public\n36\nTable of Contents\nprocess, would hurt our reputation in the industry, possibly impair our ability to sell Zoom Phone to our customers\nand harm our business.\nAs described above, the FCC could reinstate its prior network neutrality regulations or adopt new regulations. See\nPart 1A – Failures in internet infrastructure or interference with broadband access could cause current or\npotential users to believe that our systems are unreliable, possibly leading our customers and hosts to switch to\nour competitors, or to cancel their subscriptions to our platform. Changes in FCC regulation of the internet and\ninternet-based services also could impose new regulatory obligations on our other services. Such action could\nresult in extension of common carrier regulation to internet-based communications services like the ones we offer.\nThe imposition of common carrier regulation would increase our costs, and we could be required to modify our\nservice offerings to comply with regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with such regulation could result\nin substantial fines and penalties and other sanctions.\nThere have been various Congressional and executive efforts to eliminate or modify Section 230 of the\nCommunications Act of 1934, enacted as part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996. President Biden and many\nMembers of Congress from both parties support the reform or repeal of Section 230, so the possibility of\nCongressional action remains. In addition, the FCC is considering a petition, filed by the Trump Administration, to\nadopt rules interpreting Section 230, which limits the liability of internet platforms for third-party content that\nis transmitted via those platforms and for good-faith moderation of offensive content. No date has been set for a\nvote on that proposal and the FCC has not released any document describing the rules that would be proposed. The\nDemocratic members of the FCC have indicated that they are opposed to the petition and now control the agenda of\nthe FCC. There is no schedule for action by the FCC on the petition. If Congress revises or repeals Section 230 or\nthe FCC adopts rules, we may no longer be afforded the same level of protection offered by Section 230. In\naddition, there are pending cases before the judiciary that may result in changes to the protections afforded to\ninternet platforms, including a lawsuit by former President Trump that, if successful, would greatly limit the\nscope of Section 230. Further, on October 3, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case to determine\nwhether Google should be liable for damages because YouTube’s suggestion algorithm promoted radical Islamic videos\nthat incited a terrorist attack in France. A decision in that case is expected by the end of June 2023. These\nvarious efforts to limit the protections provided by Section 230 would increase the risks faced by internet-based\nbusinesses, like Zoom, that rely on third-party content. Even if claims asserted against us do not result in\nliability, we may incur substantial costs in investigating and defending such claims. If we are found liable for\nour customers’ or other users’ activities, we could be required to pay fines or penalties, redesign business\nmethods or otherwise expend resources to remedy any damages caused by such actions and to avoid future liability.\nThe FCC has proposed to revise its rules requiring reporting of breaches of private customer information, known as\nCPNI. If adopted, the proposed rules could broaden the types of CPNI breaches that must be reported, but also could\nlimit the number of reports that must be filed by adopting a minimum threshold for the number of customers\naffected. The proposed rules also would require that breach reports be provided directly to the FCC, which could\nincrease the risk of enforcement action, including fines and behavioral remedies.\nThe FCC has adopted rules that prohibit Chinese companies that are deemed to be a national security risk by other\nfederal agencies from obtaining new authorizations and placed on a list known as the Covered List to sell\ntelecommunications equipment in the U.S. and is considering proposed rules that would ban those companies from\nselling previously-authorized equipment or could prohibit use of their equipment in the U.S. Zoom does not\ncurrently have any equipment from the companies subject to the ban in its network, but if other companies are added\nto the Covered List and the FCC adopts rules that ban sales or use of equipment from companies on the Covered List,\nwe could be required to find new sources for similar equipment or replace existing equipment entirely.\nState Regulation\nState telecommunications regulation of Zoom Phone is generally preempted by the FCC. However, states are allowed to\nassess state USF contributions, E-911 fees, and other surcharges. A number of states require us to contribute to\nstate USF and pay E-911 and other assessments and surcharges, while others are actively considering extending their\nprograms to include the products we offer and the California Public Utilities Commission is now taking the position\nthat it can require VoIP providers like Zoom Phone to obtain authority to operate in that state. We generally pass\nUSF, E-911 fees, and other surcharges through to our customers where we are permitted to do so, which may result in\nour products becoming more expensive. We expect that state public utility commissions will continue their attempts\nto apply state telecommunications regulations to services like Zoom Phone. If we do not comply with any current or\nfuture state regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to substantial fines and penalties, we may\nhave to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise the price of our products, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nA federal court judge denied a request for a preliminary injunction against California’s state-specific network\nneutrality law, and as a result, California began enforcing that law on March 25, 2021. Trade associations\nrepresenting internet service providers appealed the district court’s ruling denying the preliminary injunction,\nand the appeal was denied on January 28, 2022. On April 20, 2022 the Ninth Circuit declined to rehear the case and\nthe appellants have since announced that they will not\n37\nTable of Contents\nfile for an appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court. We cannot predict whether other state initiatives will be enforced,\nmodified, overturned, or vacated.\nLegislation has been adopted in Florida and Texas that is intended to reduce or eliminate the power of businesses\noperating on the Internet to moderate user-generated content, implicitly eliminating the federal protections\ngranted under Section 230. Similar legislation has been introduced in other states in 2022, including a bill that\nhas passed the Georgia State Senate and is pending before the Georgia House. Implementation of the Florida and\nTexas statutes has been stayed by various federal courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court. On August 18, the\nparties in the Florida case requested, and were granted, a stay of the appeals court mandate pending Supreme Court\nreview, and on September 21, 2022, Florida requested that the Supreme Court review the case. On September 16, the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued a decision upholding the Texas law. On September 30, the parties\nin that case filed an unopposed motion to stay the Fifth Circuit decision pending Supreme Court review, and the\nFifth Circuit granted that request on October 13, 2022. The parties opposing the Texas law requested that the\nSupreme Court review the case on December 15, 2022. The conflict between the decisions on the two laws increases\nthe likelihood that the Supreme Court will review these statutes. Florida recently amended its statute in an effort\nto address issues that led the court to issue the stay. It is likely that any other such state legislation also\nwould be challenged under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and on the ground that it is preempted by\nSection 230. We cannot predict whether any such state legislation will be adopted, enforced, modified, overturned,\nor vacated.\nInternational Regulation\nAs we expand internationally, we may be subject to telecommunications, consumer protection, privacy, data\nprotection, and other laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we offer our products. If we do not\ncomply with any current or future international regulations that apply to our business, we could be subject to\nsubstantial fines and penalties, we may have to restructure our product offerings, exit certain markets, or raise\nthe price of our products, any of which could harm our business.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe are currently, and may be in the future, party to intellectual property rights claims and other litigation\nmatters, which, if resolved adversely, could harm our business.\nWe protect our intellectual property through patents, copyrights, trademarks, domain names, and trade secrets and,\nfrom time to time, are subject to litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, or other\nviolations of intellectual property or other rights. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large\nnumbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we face\nincreasing competition and gain an increasingly high profile, the possibility of intellectual property rights\nclaims, commercial claims, and other assertions against us grows. We have in the past been, are currently, and may\nfrom time to time in the future become, a party to litigation and disputes related to our intellectual property,\nour business practices, and our platform. While we intend to defend these lawsuits vigorously and believe that we\nhave valid defenses to these claims, litigation can be costly and time consuming, divert the attention of our\nmanagement and key personnel from our business operations and dissuade potential customers from subscribing to our\nservices, which would harm our business. Furthermore, with respect to these lawsuits, there can be no assurances\nthat favorable outcomes will be obtained. We may need to settle litigation and disputes on terms that are\nunfavorable to us, or we may be subject to an unfavorable judgment that may not be reversible upon appeal. The\nterms of any settlement or judgment may require us to cease some or all of our operations or pay substantial\namounts to the other party. In addition, our agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions\nfor indemnifying them against liabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights,\nwhich could require us to make payments to our customers. During the course of any litigation or dispute, we may\nmake announcements regarding the results of hearings and motions and other interim developments. If securities\nanalysts and investors regard these announcements as negative, the market price of our Class A common stock may\ndecline. With respect to any intellectual property rights claim, we may have to seek a license to continue\npractices found to be in violation of third-party rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms and may\nsignificantly increase our operating expenses. A license to continue such practices may not be available to us at\nall, and we may be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology or practices or discontinue the\npractices. The development of alternative, non-infringing technology or practices could require significant effort\nand expense. Our business could be harmed as a result.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary information could diminish our brand and\nother intangible assets.\nWe primarily rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patent, patent licenses, trade secret and\ndomain name protection, trademark and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our\nemployees, consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. We make\nbusiness decisions about when to seek patent protection for a particular technology and when to rely upon copyright\nor trade secret protection, and the approach we select may ultimately prove to be inadequate. Even in cases where\nwe seek patent protection, there is no assurance\n38\nTable of Contents\nthat the resulting patents will effectively protect every significant feature of our products. In addition, we\nbelieve that the protection of our trademark rights is an important factor in product recognition, protecting our\nbrand and maintaining goodwill. If we do not adequately protect our rights in our trademarks from infringement and\nunauthorized use, any goodwill that we have developed in those trademarks could be lost or impaired, which could\nharm our brand and our business. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights; third\nparties may challenge our proprietary right; our pending and future patent, trademark, and copyright applications\nmay not be approved; and we may not be able to prevent infringement without incurring substantial expense. We have\nalso devoted substantial resources to the development of our proprietary technologies and related processes. In\norder to protect our proprietary technologies and processes, we rely in part on trade secret laws and\nconfidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties. These agreements may not effectively\nprevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized\ndisclosure of confidential information. In addition, others may independently discover our trade secrets, in which\ncase we would not be able to assert trade secret rights, or develop similar technologies and processes. Further,\nthe laws of certain foreign countries do not provide the same level of protection of corporate proprietary\ninformation and assets such as intellectual property, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, and records, as the laws\nof the United States. For instance, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing\ncountries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection. As a result, we may\nencounter significant problems in protecting and defending our intellectual property or proprietary rights abroad.\nAdditionally, we may also be exposed to material risks of theft or unauthorized reverse engineering of our\nproprietary information and other intellectual property, including technical data, manufacturing processes, data\nsets, or other sensitive information. Our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights in such foreign\ncountries may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we\ndevelop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of\noperations. Costly and time-consuming litigation could be necessary to enforce and determine the scope of our\nproprietary rights. If the protection of our proprietary rights is inadequate to prevent use or appropriation by\nthird parties, the value of our platform, brand, and other intangible assets may be diminished, and competitors may\nbe able to more effectively replicate our platform and its features. Any of these events would harm our business.\nOur use of third-party open source software could negatively affect our ability to offer and sell subscriptions to\nour platform and subject us to possible litigation.\nWe have incorporated, and may in the future incorporate, third-party open source software in our technologies. Open\nsource software is generally licensed by its authors or other third parties under open source licenses. From time\nto time, companies that use third-party open source software have faced claims challenging the use of such open\nsource software and requesting compliance with the open source software license terms. Accordingly, we may be\nsubject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming non-\ncompliance with the applicable open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require end-users\nwho use, distribute or make available across a network software and services that include open source software to\noffer aspects of the technology that incorporates the open source software for no cost. We may also be required to\nmake publicly available source code (which in some circumstances could include valuable proprietary code) for\nmodifications or derivative works we create based upon incorporating or using the open source software and/or to\nlicense such modifications or derivative works under the terms of the particular open source license. Additionally,\nif a third-party software provider has incorporated open source software into software that we license from such\nprovider, we could be required to disclose our source code that incorporates or is a modification of such licensed\nsoftware. While we use tools designed to help us monitor and comply with the licenses of third-party open source\nsoftware and protect our valuable proprietary source code, we may inadvertently use third-party open source\nsoftware in a manner that exposes us to claims of non-compliance with the terms of their licenses, including claims\nof intellectual property rights infringement or for breach of contract. Furthermore, there exists today an\nincreasing number of types of open source software licenses, almost none of which have been tested in courts of law\nto provide guidance of their proper legal interpretations. If we were to receive a claim of non-compliance with the\nterms of any of these open source licenses, we could be required to publicly release certain portions of our\nproprietary source code. We could also be required to expend substantial time and resources to re-engineer some of\nour software. Any of the foregoing could disrupt and harm our business.\nIn addition, the use of third-party open source software typically exposes us to greater risks than the use of\nthird-party commercial software because open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on\nthe functionality or origin of the software. Use of open source software may also present additional security risks\nbecause the public availability of such software may make it easier for hackers and other third parties to\ndetermine how to compromise our platform. Any of the foregoing could harm our business and could help our\ncompetitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Class A Common Stock\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock may be volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\n39\nTable of Contents\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile and could be subject\nto fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. For example, in connection\nwith the COVID-19 pandemic recovery and recent changes in macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation,\nrecessionary or uncertain environments and fluctuations in our currency exchange rates have caused uncertainty in\nour business and as a result, the trading price of our Class A common stock has significantly decreased along with\nthe broader market. There are no assurances that the trading price of our Class A common stock will continue at\nthis level for any period of time. These fluctuations could cause you to lose all or part of your investment in our\nClass A common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our Class A common stock\ninclude the following:\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\nvolatility in the trading prices and trading volumes of technology stocks;\nchanges in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology companies generally, or those in\nour industry in particular;\nsales of shares of our Class A common stock by us or our stockholders;\nfailure of securities analysts to maintain coverage of us, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts\nwho follow our company, or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\nthe financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in those projections, or our failure to meet\nthose projections;\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products, features, or services;\nthe public’s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements, and filings with the SEC;\nrumors and market speculation involving us or other companies in our industry;\nactual or anticipated changes in our results of operations or fluctuations in our results of operations;\nactual or anticipated developments in our business, our competitors’ businesses, or the competitive landscape\ngenerally;\nlitigation involving us, our industry, or both, or investigations by regulators into our operations or those of\nour competitors;\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our intellectual property or other proprietary rights;\nannounced or completed acquisitions of businesses, products, services, or technologies by us or our competitors;\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidelines, interpretations, or principles;\nany significant change in our management; and\ngeneral economic conditions and slow or negative growth of our markets.\nIn addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and in the market price of a\nparticular company’s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these\ncompanies. For example, in April 2020, June 2020, July 2020, and October 2021, we and certain of our officers and\ndirectors were sued in putative class action lawsuits and purported shareholder derivative lawsuits alleging\nviolations of the federal securities laws for allegedly making materially false and misleading statements about our\ndata privacy and security measures. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert\nour management’s time and attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. We may be the\ntarget of additional litigation of this type in the future as well.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation\nhas the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our IPO,\nincluding our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, limiting your ability to influence\ncorporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. As of January\n31, 2023, the holders of our outstanding Class B common stock held 65.4% of the voting power of our outstanding\ncapital stock, with our directors, executive officers and 5% stockholders and their respective affiliates holding\n57.9% of such voting power in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2023, our founder, President and Chief Executive\nOfficer, Eric S. Yuan, together with his affiliates, held approximately 7.7% of our outstanding capital stock but\ncontrolled approximately 31.6% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. Therefore, these holders have\nsignificant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring stockholder approval,\nincluding election of directors and significant corporate transactions,\n40\nTable of Contents\nsuch as a merger or other sale of Zoom or our assets, for the foreseeable future. Each share of Class B common\nstock will be automatically converted into one share of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (i) the date that\nis six months following the death or incapacity of Mr. Yuan, (ii) the date that is six months following the date\nthat Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (iii) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then outstanding shares of Class B common stock, voting as a separate\nclass, and (iv) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO.\nIn addition, the holders of Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters\nsubmitted to our stockholders for approval even if their stock holdings represent less than a majority of the\noutstanding shares of our common stock. This concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate\nmatters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be\nadversely affected.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting to Class A\ncommon stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of\nClass B common stock who retain their shares in the long term. If, for example, Mr. Yuan retains a significant\nportion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could, in the future, control a\nmajority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Yuan owes a\nfiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best\ninterests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Yuan is entitled to vote his\nshares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nIn addition, in July 2017, FTSE Russell and Standard & Poor’s announced that they would cease to allow most newly\npublic companies utilizing dual- or multi-class capital structures to be included in their indices. Affected\nindices include the Russell 2000 and the S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600, which together make up the\nS&P Composite 1500. Under the announced policies, our dual-class capital structure would make us ineligible for\ninclusion in any of these indices, and as a result, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds, and other investment\nvehicles that attempt to passively track these indices will not be investing in our stock. These policies may\ndepress the valuations of publicly-traded companies excluded from the indices or depress our trading volume\ncompared to those of other similar companies that are included.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase capital stock could result in additional\ndilution of the percentage ownership of our stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline.\nFuture sales and issuances of our capital stock or rights to purchase our capital stock could result in substantial\ndilution to our existing stockholders. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities, and other equity\nsecurities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. If we sell\nany such securities in subsequent transactions, investors may be materially diluted. New investors in such\nsubsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences, and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A\ncommon stock.\nSubstantial future sales of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock could cause the market\nprice of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock (after automatically\nconverting to Class A common stock) in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could\ndepress the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, certain of our stockholders have registration rights that would require us to register shares owned by\nthem for public sale in the United States. We have also filed a registration statement to register shares reserved\nfor future issuance under our equity compensation plans. As a result, subject to the satisfaction of applicable\nexercise periods and applicable volume and restrictions that apply to affiliates, the shares issued upon exercise\nof outstanding stock options or upon settlement of outstanding restricted stock unit (“RSU”) awards are available\nfor immediate resale in the United States in the open market.\nSales of our shares could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities\nin the future and at a price we deem appropriate. These sales could also cause the trading price of our Class A\ncommon stock to fall and make it more difficult for you to sell shares of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate charter documents and under Delaware law may prevent or frustrate attempts by our\nstockholders to change our management or hinder efforts to acquire a controlling interest in us, and the market\nprice of our Class A common stock may be lower as a result.\nThere are provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws that may make it difficult for a third party to\nacquire, or attempt to acquire, control of Zoom, even if a change in control was considered favorable by our\nstockholders.\nOur charter documents also contain other provisions that could have an anti-takeover effect, such as:\n41\nTable of Contents\nestablishing a classified board of directors so that not all members of our board of directors are elected at one\ntime;\npermitting the board of directors to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created\ndirectorships;\nproviding that directors may only be removed for cause;\nprohibiting cumulative voting for directors;\nrequiring super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\nauthorizing the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock that our board of directors could use to implement a\nstockholder rights plan;\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a\nmeeting of our stockholders; and\nour dual-class common stock structure as described above.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware\nGeneral Corporation Law, which prohibit a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging\nor combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in\nexcess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nAny provision in our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or\ndeterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their\nshares of our Class A common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our\nClass A common stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and\nthe federal district courts of the United States of America as the exclusive forums for certain disputes between us\nand our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us\nor our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that, unless we consent in writing to the selection\nof an alternative forum, the sole and exclusive forum for the following types of actions or proceedings under\nDelaware statutory or common law: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (ii) any action\nasserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers, or other employees to us or\nour stockholders; (iii) any action arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or\nthe certificate of incorporation or the amended and restated bylaws; or (iv) any other action asserting a claim\nthat is governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if\nthe Court of Chancery does not have jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), in all\ncases subject to the court having jurisdiction over indispensable parties named as defendants. This provision would\nnot apply to suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act. Furthermore, Section 22 of\nthe Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all such Securities Act\nactions. Accordingly, both state and federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain such claims. To prevent having\nto litigate claims in multiple jurisdictions and the threat of inconsistent or contrary rulings by different\ncourts, among other considerations, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the federal\ndistrict courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a\ncause of action arising under the Securities Act. While the Delaware courts have determined that such choice of\nforum provisions are facially valid, a stockholder may nevertheless seek to bring a claim in a venue other than\nthose designated in the exclusive forum provisions. In such instance, we would expect to vigorously assert the\nvalidity and enforceability of the exclusive forum provisions of our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation. This may require significant additional costs associated with resolving such action in other\njurisdictions and there can be no assurance that the provisions will be enforced by a court in those other\njurisdictions.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in any of our securities shall be deemed to\nhave notice of and consented to these provisions. These exclusive-forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s\nability to bring a claim in a judicial forum of its choosing for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or\nother employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees. If a\ncourt were to find either exclusive-forum provision in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be\ninapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur further significant additional costs associated with\nresolving the dispute in other jurisdictions, all of which could harm our results of operations.\n42\nTable of Contents\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared nor paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings to finance the operation and expansion of our business, and we do not expect to declare or pay any\ndividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, stockholders must rely on sales of their Class A common stock\nafter price appreciation as the only way to realize any future returns on their investment.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEstimates of our market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the\nmarket in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at\nall.\nMarket opportunity estimates and growth forecasts for the markets in which we compete, including those we have\ngenerated ourselves, are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not\nprove to be accurate. Not every organization covered by our market opportunity estimates will necessarily buy video\ncommunications and collaboration platforms, and some or many of those organizations may choose to continue using\nlegacy communication methods or point solutions offered by our competitors. It is impossible to build every product\nfeature that every customer or host wants, and our competitors may develop and offer features that our platform\ndoes not provide. The variables that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over\ntime, and there is no guarantee that any particular number or percentage of the organizations covered by our market\nopportunity estimates will purchase our solutions at all or generate any particular level of revenue for us. Even\nif the markets in which we compete meet the size estimates and growth forecasts, our business could fail to grow\nfor a variety of reasons outside of our control, including competition in our industry. If any of these risks\nmaterializes, it could harm our business and prospects.\nOur business could be disrupted by catastrophic events.\nOccurrence of any catastrophic event, including earthquake, fire, flood, tsunami or other weather event, power\nloss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, disease,\nor health epidemics, could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In particular, our U.S. headquarters and\nsome of the data centers we utilize are located in the San Francisco Bay Area, a region known for seismic activity,\nand our insurance coverage may not compensate us for losses that may occur in the event of an earthquake or other\nsignificant natural disaster. In addition, acts of terrorism could cause disruptions to the internet or the economy\nas a whole. Even with our disaster recovery arrangements, our service could be interrupted. Moreover, if our\nsystems were to fail or be negatively impacted as a result of a natural disaster or other event, our ability to\ndeliver products to our users would be impaired, or we could lose critical data. If we are unable to develop\nadequate plans to ensure that our business functions continue to operate during and after a disaster and to execute\nsuccessfully on those plans in the event of a disaster or emergency, our business would be harmed.\nWe also face risks related to health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted virtually every\ncountry in the world. An outbreak of a contagious disease, and other adverse health developments could have an\nadverse effect on global economic conditions and on our business. The effects could include business and service\ndisruptions, such as the temporary closure of our facilities, restrictions on our employees' ability to travel to\nsupport our facilities and services, and difficulties in hiring new employees. While we have seen increased usage\nof our service globally, a significant portion of such increase is attributable to free Basic accounts, which do\nnot generate any revenue. We cannot make any assurances that we will experience an increase in paid hosts or that\nnew or existing users will continue to utilize our services at the same levels during the COVID-19 pandemic\nrecovery. Furthermore, such increased usage by free Basic account users during this time has required and will\ncontinue to require us to expand our network capacity which will increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our strategic investments, including partial or complete loss of invested\ncapital. Significant changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio could negatively impact our financial\nresults.\nWe have strategic investments in publicly traded and privately held companies. The financial success of our\ninvestments in any privately held company is typically dependent on a liquidity event, such as a public offering,\nacquisition or other favorable market event reflecting appreciation to the cost of our initial investment. In\naddition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex due to the lack of readily available market\ndata. Likewise, the financial success of our investment in any publicly held company is typically dependent upon an\nexit in favorable market conditions, and to a lesser extent on liquidity events. The capital markets for public\nofferings and acquisitions are dynamic and the likelihood of successful liquidity events for the companies we have\ninvested in could significantly worsen. In addition, valuations of privately held companies are inherently complex\ndue to the lack of readily available market data.\nWe record all fair value adjustments of our publicly traded and privately held non-marketable securities through\nthe consolidated statement of operations. As a result, we may experience additional volatility to our statements of\noperations due to\n43\nTable of Contents\nchanges in market prices of our investments in publicly held securities and the valuation and timing of observable\nprice changes or impairments of our investments in privately held securities. Our ability to mitigate this\nvolatility in any given period may be impacted by our contractual obligations to hold securities for a set period\nof time. All of our investments are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of investment capital. Changes in\nthe fair value or partial or total loss of investment capital of these individual companies could be material to\nour financial statements and negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur reported results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in accounting principles generally accepted\nin the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the FASB, the SEC,\nand various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these\nprinciples or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported results of operations and may even\naffect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. It is also\ndifficult to predict the impact of future changes to accounting principles or our accounting policies, any of which\ncould harm our business.\nWe may need additional capital, and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable\nterms, or at all.\nHistorically, we have funded our operations and capital expenditures primarily through equity issuances and cash\ngenerated from our operations. Although we currently anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents and\ncash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future, we may require\nadditional financing. We evaluate financing opportunities from time to time, and our ability to obtain financing\nwill depend, among other things, on our development efforts, business plans, operating performance, and condition\nof the capital markets at the time we seek financing. We cannot assure you that additional financing will be\navailable to us on favorable terms when required, or at all, particularly during times of market volatility and\ngeneral economic instability. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or equity-linked or debt\nsecurities, those securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to the rights of our Class A common\nstock, and our stockholders may experience dilution.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting,\nour ability to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements or comply with applicable regulations\ncould be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-\nOxley Act”) and the rules and regulations of the applicable listing standards of The Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect\nthat the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting, and financial\ncompliance costs; make some activities more difficult, time-consuming, and costly; and place significant strain on\nour personnel, systems, and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and\nother procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we\nwill file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC\nrules and forms and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and\ncommunicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal\ncontrol over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and\nprocedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to\nexpend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in\nour business. In addition, changes in accounting principles or interpretations could also challenge our internal\ncontrols and require that we establish new business processes, systems, and controls to accommodate such changes.\nWe have limited experience with implementing the systems and controls that will be necessary to operate as a public\ncompany, as well as adopting changes in accounting principles or interpretations mandated by the relevant\nregulatory bodies. Additionally, if these new systems, controls, or standards and the associated process changes do\nnot give rise to the benefits that we expect or do not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial\nreporting systems and processes, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial reports, or the effectiveness\nof internal control over financial reporting. Moreover, our business may be harmed if we experience problems with\nany new systems and controls that result in delays in their implementation or increased costs to correct any post-\nimplementation issues that may arise.\nFurther, weaknesses in our disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in\nthe future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls or any difficulties encountered in their\nimplementation or improvement could harm our business or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may\nresult in a restatement of\n44\nTable of Contents\nour consolidated financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal\ncontrol over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and\nannual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting that we will eventually be required to include in our periodic reports\nthat will be filed with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial\nreporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which\nwould likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, if we are unable\nto continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. We are\nrequired to provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial\nreporting.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm is required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our\ninternal control over financial reporting. Our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report\nthat is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our internal control over financial\nreporting is documented, designed, or operating. Any failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal\ncontrol over financial reporting could harm our business and could cause a decline in the trading price of our\nClass A common stock.\nOur Class A common stock market price and trading volume could decline if securities or industry analysts do not\npublish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or\nindustry analysts publish about us or our business. The analysts’ estimates are based upon their own opinions and\nare often different from our estimates or expectations. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our\nClass A common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our securities\nwould likely decline. If one or more securities analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us\nregularly, demand for our securities could decrease, which might cause the price and trading volume of our Class A\ncommon stock to decline.\nWe incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public\ncompanies in the United States, which may harm our business.\nAs a public company listed in the United States, we incur significant additional legal, accounting, and other\nexpenses. In addition, changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public\ndisclosure, including regulations implemented by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market, may increase legal and\nfinancial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are\nsubject to varying interpretations, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new\nguidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving\nlaws, regulations, and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses\nand a diversion of management’s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If,\nnotwithstanding our efforts, we fail to comply with new laws, regulations, and standards, regulatory authorities\nmay initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nFailure to comply with these rules might also make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance,\nincluding director and officer liability insurance, and we might be forced to accept reduced policy limits and\ncoverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. The impact of these events\nwould also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of\ndirectors, on committees of our board of directors, or as members of senior management.\nInvestors’ and other stakeholders’ expectations of our performance relating to environmental, social and governance\nfactors may impose additional costs and expose us to new risks.\nThere is an increasing focus from certain investors, customers, employees, and other stakeholders concerning\nenvironmental, social and governance matters (“ESG”). Some investors may use these non-financial performance\nfactors to guide their investment strategies and, in some cases, may choose not to invest in us if they believe our\npolicies and actions relating to ESG are inadequate. We may face reputational damage in the event that we do not\nmeet the ESG standards set by various constituencies.\nAs ESG best practices and reporting standards continue to develop, we may incur increasing costs relating to ESG\nmonitoring and reporting and complying with ESG initiatives. For example, the SEC has recently proposed climate\nchange and ESG reporting requirements, which, if approved, would increase our compliance costs. We may also face\ngreater costs to comply with new ESG standards or initiatives in the European Union. We recently published our ESG\nReport for fiscal year 2022, which describes, among other things, the measurement of our greenhouse gas emissions\nin 2021 and our efforts to reduce emissions. In addition, our ESG Report provides highlights of how we are\nsupporting our workforce, including our efforts to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Our disclosures on\nthese matters, or a failure to meet evolving stakeholder expectations for ESG practices and reporting, may\npotentially harm our reputation and customer relationships. Due to new\n45\nTable of Contents\nregulatory standards and market standards, certain new or existing customers, particularly those in the European\nUnion, may impose stricter ESG guidelines or mandates for, and may scrutinize relationships more closely with,\ntheir counterparties, including us, which may lengthen sales cycles or increase our costs.\nFurthermore, if our competitors’ ESG performance is perceived to be better than ours, potential or current\ninvestors may elect to invest with our competitors instead. In addition, in the event that we communicate certain\ninitiatives or goals regarding ESG matters, we could fail, or be perceived to fail, in our achievement of such\ninitiatives or goals, or we could be criticized for the scope of such initiatives or goals. If we fail to satisfy\nthe expectations of investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders or our initiatives are not executed as\nplanned, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be adversely affected.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change (such as drought, wildfires,\nhurricanes, increased storm severity and sea level rise), we recognize that there are inherent climate-related\nrisks wherever business is conducted. Our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate\nchange. For example, certain of our offices have experienced, and are projected to continue to experience, climate-\nrelated events at an increasing frequency, including drought, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality\nimpacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention. Changing market dynamics, global policy\ndevelopments and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the\nU.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our third-party suppliers and the\nbusiness of our customers, and may cause us to experience losses and additional costs to maintain or resume\noperations. In addition, we may be subject to increased regulations, reporting requirements, standards or\nexpectations regarding the environmental impacts of our business.",

Because many of our shares of Class A common stock are held in street name by brokers and\nother nominees on behalf of stockholders, we are unable to estimate the total number of beneficial owners of our\nClass A common stock represented by these holders of record.\nDividend Policy\n46\nTable of Contents\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain any future\nearnings and do not expect to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together\nwith the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThis discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and\nuncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements\nas a result of various factors, including those discussed in the section titled “Risk Factors” and in other parts\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nOur mission is to make communications frictionless and secure.\nZoom enables people to connect to others, share ideas, make plans, and build toward a future limited only by their\nimagination. Our frictionless communications and collaboration platform started with video as its foundation, and\nwe have set the standard for innovation ever since. That is why Zoom is an intuitive, scalable, and secure choice\nfor large enterprises, small businesses, and individuals alike. We provide a unified communications and\ncollaboration platform that delivers happiness and fundamentally changes how people interact, connecting them\nthrough frictionless and secure meetings, phone, chat, content sharing and more. Our Developer Platform enables\ncustomers, developers, and service providers to easily build apps and integrations on top of Zoom’s industry-\nleading video communications and collaboration platform, with opportunities for global discovery and distribution.\nOur virtual and hybrid event solutions allow users to seamlessly create and manage engaging events.\nWe believe that face-to-face communications build greater empathy and trust. We strive to live up to the trust our\ncustomers place in us by delivering a communications solution while prioritizing their privacy and security. Our 28\nco-located data centers worldwide and the public cloud in conjunction with our proprietary adaptive rate codec\nenable us to provide both high-quality and high-definition, real-time video to our customers even in low-bandwidth\nenvironments.\nWe generate revenue from the sale of subscriptions to our unified communications and collaboration platform.\nSubscription revenue is driven primarily by the number of paid hosts as well as purchases of additional products,\nincluding Zoom Phone, Zoom Spaces, Zoom Events, Zoom Contact Center and Zoom IQ for Sales. A host is any user of\nour unified communications and collaboration platform who initiates a Zoom Meeting and invites one or more\nparticipants to join that meeting. We refer to hosts who subscribe to a paid Zoom Meeting plan as “paid hosts.” We\ndefine a customer as a separate and distinct buying entity, which can be a single paid user or host or an\norganization of any size (including a distinct unit of an organization) that has multiple paid hosts. Our Zoom One\nBasic offering is free and gives hosts access to Zoom Meetings with core features but with the limitation that\nmeetings time-out at 40 minutes. Our core paid offerings are available with our Zoom One bundles: Zoom One Pro,\nBusiness, Business Plus, Enterprise, and Enterprise Plus. The Zoom One bundles are designed for different business\nneeds and are composed of Zoom Meetings, Zoom Team Chat, Zoom Whiteboard and Mail and Calendar as well as Zoom\nPhone, Zoom Webinars and Zoom Rooms for our Enterprise plans. We also offer vertical-specific plans for Education,\nHealthcare and Government which provide incremental features and functionality, such as different participant\nlimits, administrative controls, and reporting.\n48\nTable of Contents\nFor Zoom Phone, plans include Zoom Phone Pro, which provides extension-to-extension calling or can be used with the\nBring Your Own Carrier model wherein the customer connects Zoom Phone to an existing carrier. We also offer\nRegional Unlimited and Regional Metered calling plans in four specific markets (Australia/New Zealand, Japan,\nUnited Kingdom/Ireland and United States/Canada). In addition, we introduced the Global Select plan in August 2020,\nwhich allows customers to select from local numbers and domestic calling in more than 45 countries and territories\nwhere Zoom has local public switched telephone network (“PSTN”) coverage.\nOur revenue was $4,393.0 million, $4,099.9 million, and $2,651.4 million for the fiscal years ended January 31,\n2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively, representing period-over-period growth rate of 7% and 55% for fiscal year 2023\nand fiscal year 2022, respectively. We had net income of $103.7 million, $1,375.6 million, and $672.3 million for\nthe fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by operating activities\nwas $1,290.3 million, $1,605.3 million, and $1,471.2 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and\n2021, respectively.\nMacroeconomic Conditions and other Factors\nRecent changes in macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation, recessionary and uncertain environments, and\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, have and may continue to cause uncertainty in our business. For\nthe year ended January 31, 2023, we experienced continued growth in total revenue and revenue from Enterprise\ncustomers. However, macroeconomic conditions, including high inflation and continued uncertainty regarding the\ncurrent and future political and economic environment, have and may continue to impact the future demand for\nsubscriptions to our unified communications and collaboration platform. For example, for the year ended January 31,\n2023, we experienced unfavorable foreign currency impact as a result of the continued strengthening of the U.S.\ndollar compared to certain foreign jurisdictions where we do a significant amount of business, which resulted in a\n$69.1 million negative impact on revenue for the year ended January 31, 2023.\nDuring the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, many organizations resorted to mandating employees to work from home,\nwhich resulted in these organizations seeking out video communication solutions like ours to keep employees as\nproductive as possible, even while working from home. There is no assurance that we will experience an increase in\npaid hosts or that new or existing users will continue to utilize our service after the COVID-19 pandemic has\ntapered globally. As reported in prior periods we experienced significant revenue growth. This revenue growth has\ndeclined and we expect our revenue growth to generally decline as compared to prior periods. Many factors may\ncontribute to declines in our growth rate, among other things, higher market penetration, increased competition,\nslowing demand for our platform from the tapering of the COVID-19 pandemic, a slower than anticipated\ncapitalization on growth opportunities, and the maturation of our business.\nWe continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic\nhave been widespread, and while the COVID-19 pandemic has tapered, it continues to fluctuate in severity. Our\nrecent declines in revenue growth are primarily attributable to the tapering of the COVID-19 pandemic along with\nother macroeconomic factors. At the same time, it is starting to become clear that some of the behavioral trends\nthe COVID-19 pandemic fostered, including the shift to remote and hybrid work, may remain in place for an\nindeterminate amount of time. Given this, it is not possible for us to quantify how the tapering of the COVID-19\npandemic has impacted our current and future operations.\nIn addition the global impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including various sanctions and export\nrestrictions on Russia and Belarus by the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other\ngovernmental authorities remain highly uncertain. The Russia-Ukraine war impacted our EMEA revenue for the year\nended January 31, 2023. Our customers in Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine represented less than 1% of our net assets\nand total consolidated revenue as of the year ended January 31, 2023. If the Russia-Ukraine war continues or\nworsens, leading to additional sanctions, tightened export restrictions, and greater global economic disruptions\nand uncertainty, our business and results of operations could be materially impacted.\nWe are continuously monitoring the impact of these circumstances on our business and financial results, as well as\nthe overall global economy and geopolitical landscape. The implications of macroeconomic conditions on our\nbusiness, results of operations and overall financial position, particularly in the long term, remain uncertain. On\nFebruary 7, 2023, as a result of the economic environment, we announced a restructuring plan intended to reduce\noperating costs and continue advancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The restructuring plan includes\na reduction of our current workforce by approximately 15%.\nKey Factors Affecting Our Performance\nAcquiring New Customers\nWe are focused on continuing to grow the number of customers that use our platform. Our operating results and\ngrowth prospects will depend, in part, on our ability to attract new customers. While we believe there is a\nsignificant market\n49\nTable of Contents\nopportunity that our platform addresses, it is difficult to predict customer adoption rates or the future growth\nrate and size of the market for our platform. We will need to continue to invest in sales and marketing in order to\naddress this opportunity by hiring, developing, and retaining talented sales personnel who are able to achieve\ndesired productivity levels in a reasonable period of time.\nExpansion of Zoom Across Existing Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that there is a large opportunity for growth with many of our existing customers. Many customers have\nincreased the size of their subscriptions as they have expanded their use of our platform across their operations.\nSome of our larger customers start with a deployment of Zoom Meetings with one team, location, or geography, before\nrolling out our platform throughout their organization. Several of our largest customers have deployed our platform\nglobally to their entire workforce following smaller initial deployments. This expansion in the use of our platform\nalso provides us with opportunities to market and sell additional products to our customers, such as Zoom for Home,\nRooms at each office location, Developer Platform solutions, Spaces, Events, Contact Center and IQ for Sales. In\norder for us to address this opportunity to expand the use of our products with our existing customers, we will\nneed to maintain the reliability of our platform and produce new features and functionality that are responsive to\nour customers’ requirements for enterprise-grade solutions.\nWe quantify our expansion across existing Enterprise customers through our net dollar expansion rate. We define\nEnterprise customers as distinct business units who have been engaged by either our direct sales team, resellers,\nor strategic partners. Revenue from Enterprise customers represented 54.8%, 47.6% and 45.6% of total revenue for\nthe year ending January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our net dollar expansion rate includes the increase\nin user adoption within our Enterprise customers, as our subscription revenue is primarily driven by the number of\npaid hosts within a customer and the purchase of additional products, and compares our subscription revenue from\nthe same set of Enterprise customers across comparable periods. We calculate net dollar expansion rate as of a\nperiod end by starting with the annual recurring revenue (“ARR”) from all Enterprise customers as of 12 months\nprior (“Prior Period ARR”). We define ARR as the annualized revenue run rate of subscription agreements from all\ncustomers at a point in time. We calculate ARR by taking the monthly recurring revenue (“MRR”) and multiplying it\nby 12. MRR is defined as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements from all Enterprise customers\nfor the last month of the period, including revenue from monthly subscribers who have not provided any indication\nthat they intend to cancel their subscriptions. We then calculate the ARR from these Enterprise customers as of the\ncurrent period end (“Current Period ARR”), which includes any upsells, contraction, and attrition. We divide the\nCurrent Period ARR by the Prior Period ARR to arrive at the net dollar expansion rate. For the trailing 12-months\ncalculation, we take an average of the net dollar expansion rate over the trailing 12 months. Our net dollar\nexpansion rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including the level of penetration within our\ncustomer base, expansion of products and features, and our ability to retain our Enterprise customers. Our trailing\n12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers was 115%, 130%, and 152% as of January 31, 2023, 2022\nand 2021, respectively.\nRetention of Online Customers\nIn addition to Enterprise customers, we also have a significant number of customers that subscribe to our services\ndirectly through our website (“Online customers”). Online customers represent a diverse customer base, ranging from\nindividual consumers to small and medium size businesses. We continue to focus on acquisition and retention of our\nonline customer base through various strategies to improve the features and functionalities of our products and\nservices. Revenue from Online customers represented 45.2%, 52.4%, and 54.4% of total revenue for the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The ability to retain these Online customers will have an\nimpact on our future revenue. The online monthly average churn for our Online customers was 3.4%, 3.9%, and 4.9%\nper month for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. One of the dynamics in the\nOnline portion of the business is the MRR contribution from customers that have retained Zoom services for a\ncertain portion of time as these customers tend to maintain their subscriptions and contribute meaningfully to the\nOnline business. As of January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 the percentage of total Online MRR from Online customers\nwith a continual term of service of at least 16 months was 72.0%, 59.0% and 10.0% respectively.\nWe calculate our online average monthly churn by starting with the Online customer MRR as of the beginning of the\napplicable quarter (“Entry MRR”). We define Entry MRR as the recurring revenue run-rate of subscription agreements\nfrom all Online customers except for subscriptions that we recorded as churn in a previous quarter based on the\ncustomers' earlier indication to us of their intention to cancel that subscription. We then determine the MRR\nrelated to customers who canceled or downgraded their subscription or notified us of that intention during the\napplicable quarter (“Applicable Quarter MRR Churn”) and divide the Applicable Quarter MRR Churn by the applicable\nquarter Entry MRR to arrive at the MRR churn rate for Online Customers for the applicable quarter. We then divided\nthat amount by three to calculate the online average monthly churn.\n50\nTable of Contents\nInnovation and Expansion of Our Platform\nWe continue to invest resources to enhance the capabilities of our platform. For example, we have recently\nintroduced a number of product enhancements, including new features for Zoom Phone, Zoom Meetings, Zoom Webinars,\nand Zoom Events and launched Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Virtual Agent, Zoom IQ for sales, Zoom Whiteboard and Zoom\nMail and Calendar. We addressed new work-from-home realities with the introduction of Zoom for Home, a solution\ndesigned for the home office that combines Zoom software enhancements with compatible hardware. We also deliver\nZoom Phone calling plans in more than 45 countries and territories as of January 31, 2023. Third-party developers\nare also a key component of our strategy for platform innovation to make it easier for customers and developers to\nextend our product portfolio with new functionalities. We believe that as more developers and other third parties\nuse our platform to integrate major third-party applications, we will become the ubiquitous platform for\ncommunications and collaboration. We will need to expend additional resources to continue introducing new products,\nfeatures, and functionality, and supporting the efforts of third parties to enhance the value of our platform with\ntheir own applications.\nAn end-to-end encryption (“E2EE”) option is available to free and paid Zoom customers globally who host meetings\nwith up to 200 participants as well as on Zoom Phone. Zoom’s E2EE uses the same AES-256-GCM encryption that secures\nZoom meetings by default, but with Zoom’s E2EE, the meeting host, or originating caller in the case of Zoom Phone,\nas opposed to Zoom's servers, generates encryption keys and uses public key cryptography to distribute these keys\nto the other meeting participants or call recipient.\nInternational Opportunity\nOur platform addresses the communications and collaboration needs of users worldwide, and we see international\nexpansion as a major opportunity. Our revenue from the rest of world (APAC and EMEA) represented 30%, 33%, and 31%\nof our total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The decrease in\nrevenue from the rest of the world in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was due to the impact of the\nstrengthening of the U.S dollar along with macroeconomic conditions in the EMEA region. We plan to add local sales\nsupport in further select international markets over time. We use strategic partners and resellers to sell in\ncertain international markets where we have limited or no direct sales presence. While we believe global demand for\nour platform will continue to increase as international market awareness of Zoom grows, our ability to conduct our\noperations internationally will require considerable management attention and resources, and is subject to the\nparticular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures,\ncustoms, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems, and commercial markets.\nKey Business Metrics\nWe review the following key business metrics to measure our performance, identify trends, formulate financial\nprojections, and make strategic decisions.\nNumber of Enterprise Customers\nWe believe that our ability to increase the number of Enterprise customers is an indicator of our potential future\nbusiness opportunities, the growth of our business, and an indicator of our market penetration. Increasing\nawareness of our platform and capabilities, coupled with the mainstream adoption of our technology, has expanded\nthe diversity of our customer base to include organizations of all sizes across all industries. Over time, we\nexpect Enterprise customers to represent a larger share of our business. As of January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we\nhad approximately 213,000, 191,000, and 141,100 Enterprise customers, respectively.\nCustomers Contributing More Than $100,000 of Trailing 12 Months Revenue\nWe focus on growing the number of customers that contribute more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue as it\nis a measure of our ability to scale with our customers and attract larger organizations to Zoom. Revenue from\nthese customers represented 27%, 22%, and 20% of total revenue for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022,\nand 2021, respectively. As of January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we had 3,471, 2,725, and 1,644 customers,\nrespectively, that contributed more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue, demonstrating our rapid\npenetration of larger organizations, including enterprises. These customers are a subset of Enterprise customers.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to our results determined in accordance with GAAP, we believe that free cash flow (“FCF”) is a non-GAAP\nfinancial measure that is useful in evaluating our liquidity.\nFree Cash Flow\n51\nTable of Contents\nWe define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment. We\nbelieve that FCF is a useful indicator of liquidity that provides information to management and investors about the\namount of cash generated from our operations that, after investments in property and equipment, can be used for\nfuture growth. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and has limitations as an analytical\ntool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures,\nsuch as net cash provided by operating activities. It is important to note that other companies, including\ncompanies in our industry, may not use this metrics, may calculate t metrics differently, or may use other\nfinancial measures to evaluate their liquidity, all of which could reduce the usefulness of these non-GAAP metrics\nas a comparative measure.\nThe following table presents a summary of our cash flows for the fiscal years presented and a reconciliation of FCF\nto net cash provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in\naccordance with GAAP:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023             2022             2021\n-in thousands\nNet cash provided by operating              $               1,290,262    $   1,605,266    $   1,471,177\nactivities\nLess: purchases of property and                              -103,826         -132,590          -79,972\nequipment\nFree cash flow (non-GAAP)                   $               1,186,436    $   1,472,676    $   1,391,205\nNet cash used in investing activities       $                -318,322    $  -2,859,097    $  -1,562,420\nNet cash (used in) provided by financing    $                -936,942    $      34,068    $   2,050,277\nactivities\nComponents of Results of Operations\nRevenue\nWe derive our revenue from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified communications and\ncollaboration platform. Our customers generally do not have the ability to take possession of our software. We also\nprovide services, which include professional services, consulting services, and online event hosting, which are\ngenerally considered distinct from the access to our unified communications and collaboration platform. The amount\nof revenue recognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the\ncontract term which can include a free period discount.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are related to our co-\nlocated data centers, third-party cloud hosting, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related expenses,\namortization of capitalized software development and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments, and allocated\noverhead.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our\nresearch and development organization, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated\noverhead. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.\nSales and Marketing\nSales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses directly associated with our sales and\nmarketing organization. Other sales and marketing expenses include advertising and promotional events to promote\nour brand, such as awareness programs, digital programs, public relations, tradeshows, and our user conference,\nZoomtopia, and allocated overhead. Sales and marketing expenses also include credit card processing fees related to\nsales and amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs.\n52\nTable of Contents\nGeneral and Administrative\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel-related expenses associated with our finance and\nlegal organizations; professional fees for external legal, accounting, and other consulting services; expected\ncredit losses; insurance; certain indirect taxes; litigation settlements; corporate security and regulatory\nexpenses; and allocated overhead.\n(Losses) gains on Strategic Investments, Net\n(Losses) gains on strategic investments, net consist primarily of remeasurement gains or losses on our equity\ninvestments.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense) income, net consists primarily of interest income and net accretion on our marketable\nsecurities and effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nProvision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes\nProvision for (benefit from) income taxes consists primarily of income taxes related to federal, state, and foreign\njurisdictions where we conduct business.\n53\nTable of Contents\nResults of Operations\nThe following tables set forth selected consolidated statements of operations data and such data as a percentage of\nrevenue for each of the

increased by $293.1 million, or 7.1%, compared to the fiscal\nyear ended January 31, 2022. The increase in revenue was due to a 23.6% increase in revenue from subscription\nservices provided to Enterprise customers, of which 87.6% and 12.4% were from existing and new customers,\nrespectively. This increase was partially offset by a 7.7% decline in revenue from subscription services provided\nto Online customers.\nCost of Revenue\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023               2022          $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nCost of revenue    $                          1,100,451       $  1,054,554       $    45,897         4.4  %\nGross profit                                  3,292,509          3,045,310           247,199         8.1  %\nGross margin                                       74.9  %            74.3  %\nCost of revenue for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 increased by $45.9 million, or 4.4%, compared to the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $147.9 million in personnel-\nrelated expenses, which includes an increase of $104.9 million in stock-based compensation expense, mainly driven\nby additional headcount and expanded equity programs, an increase of $29.8 million related to subscription to\nsoftware-based services, and an increase in allocated overhead of $8.7 million , partially offset by a decrease of\n$144.6 million in costs mainly driven by the net impact of the transition from third-party cloud hosting to\ninternal data centers and cloud optimization.\nGross margin increased to 74.9% for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 from 74.3% for the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2022. The increase in gross margin was mainly due to increased efficiencies as we expanded our internal\ndata center capacity; in addition, during the current fiscal year, we reinstated the 40-minute time limit for\nmeetings with more than two endpoints from our free Basic accounts for more than 125,000 K-12 school domains\nworldwide, which was temporarily lifted at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. These cost-saving measures were\npartially offset by the impact from higher stock-based compensation expense.\nOperating Expenses\nResearch and Development\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023          2022       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nResearch and development    $                            774,059    $  362,990    $   411,069       113.2  %\nResearch and development expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 increased by $411.1 million, or 113.2%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel-related\nexpenses of $388.4 million, which includes a $248.7 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, mainly\ndriven by the increased headcount and expanded equity programs, and an increase of $139.7 million in non-stock\nbased related personal costs due to a 67% increase in headcount. The remainder of the increase was primarily\nattributable to an increase of $21.6 million in allocated overhead expenses.\n55\nTable of Contents\nSales and Marketing\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023            2022       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nSales and marketing    $                          1,696,590    $  1,135,959    $   560,631        49.4  %\nSales and marketing expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 increased by $560.6 million, or 49.4%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.

The remaining increase was primarily due to an increase of\n$76.9 million in marketing and sales event-related costs mainly due to an increase in awareness, social media and\ndigital programs, and an increase of $14.9 million in allocated overhead expenses.\nGeneral and Administrative\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023          2022       $ Change    % Change\n-in thousands, except percentages\nGeneral and administrative    $                            576,431    $  482,770    $    93,661        19.4  %\nGeneral and administrative expense for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 increased by $93.7 million, or 19.4%,\ncompared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.

The change in income taxes was\nprimarily due to tax shortfalls on stock-based compensation, non-deductible stock-based compensation expense,\nchanges in the valuation allowance on certain state deferred tax assets, and other compensation-related permanent\ndifferences as of January 31, 2023, compared to tax windfalls on stock-based compensation and the valuation\nallowance release on the U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets during the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nSee Note 11 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021,\nplease refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of January 31, 2023, our principal sources of liquidity were cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities\nof $5.4 billion, which were held for working capital purposes and for investment in growth opportunities. Our\nmarketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, corporate bonds, agency bonds, corporate\nand other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills.\nWe have financed our operations primarily through income from operations and sales of equity securities. Cash from\noperations could also be affected by various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the recent\nchanges in macroeconomic conditions such as high inflation, recessionary environments, and the fluctuations in\nforeign currency exchange rates, could impact the timing of cash collections from our customers and other risks\ndetailed in the section titled “Risk Factors.” However, based on our current business plan and revenue prospects,\nwe believe our existing cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, together with net cash provided by\noperations, will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next 12 months and allow us to capitalize on\ngrowth opportunities. We believe we will meet longer-term expected future cash requirements and obligations through\na combination of cash flows from operating activities and available cash balances. Our future capital requirements\nwill depend on many factors, including our revenue growth rate, subscription renewal activity, billing frequency,\nthe timing and extent of spending to support further sales and marketing and research and development efforts, as\nwell as expenses associated with our international expansion, and the timing and extent of additional capital\nexpenditures to invest in existing and new office spaces as well as data center infrastructure. We may, in the\nfuture, enter into arrangements to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, services, and technologies,\nincluding intellectual property rights. We may choose or be required to seek additional equity or debt financing.\nIn the event that additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms\nacceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, results of\noperations, and financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nOur material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations primarily relate to our leases for\noffice space and equipment, as well as non-cancelable purchase obligations. Expected timing of those payments are\nas follows:\nPayments Due by\nPeriod\nTotal                   Less Than         1 – 3        3 – 5       More Than\n(in thousands)                      1 Year         Years        Years         5 Years\nOperating lease        $         105,176    $                 25,886    $   48,706    $  22,580    $      8,004\nobligations\nNon-cancelable\npurchase                         298,855                     191,902       104,253        2,700               —\nobligations\nTotal contractual      $         404,031    $                217,788    $  152,959    $  25,280    $      8,004\nobligations\nThe contractual commitment amounts in the table above are associated with agreements that are enforceable and\nlegally binding.

Our\nprimary uses of cash from operating activities are for employee-related expenditures, costs related to hosting our\nplatform, and marketing expenses. Net cash provided by operating activities is impacted by our net income adjusted\nfor certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization expenses, as\nwell as the effect of changes in operating assets and liabilities.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,290.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, compared\nto $1,605.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022. The decrease in operating cash flow was mainly\ndriven by higher income tax payments and lower increases in deferred revenue.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities of $318.3 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was primarily\ndue to cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $120.6 million, purchases of property and equipment of\n$103.8 million, purchases of strategic investments of $69.1 million, net purchases of marketable securities of\n$13.9 million, and purchases of intangible assets of $11.3 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities of $2,859.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was primarily\ndue to net purchases of marketable securities of $2,404.8 million, purchases of strategic investments of $305.1\nmillion, purchases of property and equipment of $132.6 million, purchases of intangible assets of $13.0 million,\nand cash paid for acquisition, net of cash acquired, of $3.5 million.\nFinancing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities of $936.9 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023 was primarily\ndue to cash paid for repurchases of common stock of $1.0 billion, offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock\npursuant to our employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) of $53.7 million and proceeds from the exercise of stock\noptions of $8.6 million.\nNet cash provided by financing activities of $34.1 million for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2022 was primarily\ndue to proceeds from issuance of common stock pursuant to our ESPP of $59.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of\nstock options of $14.4 million, offset by proceeds from international employee stock sales remitted to employees\nand tax authorities of $40.0 million.\nFor a discussion of the fiscal year ended January 31, 2021 , please refer to Part II, Item 7, “Management's\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2022.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn February 2022, our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $1.0 billion of our Class A\ncommon, which was completed in December 2022. See Note 10 \"Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\" of this\nAnnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information related to share repurchases.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K promulgated by\nthe SEC under the Securities Act.\n58\nTable of Contents\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nCritical accounting estimates are those accounting estimates that require the most difficult, subjective or complex\njudgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently\nuncertain. These estimates are developed based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we\nbelieve to be reasonable under the circumstances. Critical accounting estimates are accounting estimates where the\nnature of the estimates are material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly\nuncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change and the impact of the estimates on financial\ncondition or operating performance is material.\nWe believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 1 “Summary of Business and\nSignificant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements, the following critical estimates involve\na greater degree of judgment and complexity.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting services, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue\nrecognized reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract\nterm which can include a free period discount. We apply judgment during the identification of a contract to\ndetermine the customer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the\ncustomer’s historical payment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information\npertaining to the customer. The transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be\nentitled in exchange for transferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the\ntransaction price if, in our judgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue\nrecognized under the contract will not occur.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts.\nSignificant judgment is required in arriving at this estimated period of benefit. We determine the period of\nbenefit for commissions paid for the acquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the\ninitial estimated customer life and the technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform\nand related significant features. We do not pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized\non a straight-line basis commensurate with the pattern of revenue recognition.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Intangible Assets\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually, in the fourth quarter of\neach fiscal year, or more often if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. As of\nJanuary 31, 2023, no impairment of goodwill has been identified.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination. Finite-lived intangible assets are\ninitially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. We\nroutinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful\n59\nTable of Contents\nlives of our finite-lived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to\nthe remaining period of amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not\namortized. We review the useful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine\nwhether events and circumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine\nthat the life of an intangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and\namortized prospectively over its estimated remaining useful life. We have not recorded any impairment charges\nduring the fiscal years presented.\nStrategic Investments\nAccounting for strategic investments in privately held debt and equity securities in which we do not have a\ncontrolling interest or significant influence requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions.\nValuations of privately held securities are inherently complex and require judgment due to the lack of readily\navailable market data. Privately held debt and equity securities are valued using significant unobservable inputs\nor data in an inactive market. The valuation requires our judgment due to the absence of market prices and inherent\nlack of liquidity. The carrying values of our privately held equity securities are adjusted if there are observable\nprice changes in a same or similar security from the same issuer or if there are identified events or changes in\ncircumstances that may indicate impairment, as discussed below. In determining the estimated fair value of our\nstrategic investments in privately held companies, we utilize the most recent data available, as adjusted to\nreflect the specific rights and preferences of those securities we hold.\nWe assess our privately held debt and equity securities strategic investment portfolio quarterly for indicators for\nimpairment. Our impairment analysis encompasses a qualitative assessment evaluates key factors including but not\nlimited to the investee’s financial metrics, market acceptance of the product or technology, and the rate at which\nthe investee is using its cash. If the investment is considered to be impaired, we record the investment at fair\nvalue by recognizing an impairment through the consolidated statement of operations and establishing a new carrying\nvalue for the investment.\nThe privately held debt and equity securities we hold, and their rights and preferences relative to those of other\nsecurities within the capital structure, may impact the magnitude by which our investment value moves in relation\nto movement of the total enterprise value of the company. As a result, our investment value in a specific company\nmay move by more or less than any change in the value of that overall company. An immediate decrease of ten percent\nin enterprise value of our largest privately held equity securities held as of January 31, 2023 would not have had\na material impact on the value of our investment portfolio.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is\nrecognized based on the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and\nassets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements\nor tax returns. We make assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine the current income tax provision\n(benefit), deferred tax asset and liabilities and valuation allowance recorded against a deferred tax asset. The\nassumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the current income tax provision (benefit) take into account\ncurrent tax laws, their interpretation and possible results of foreign and domestic tax audits. Changes in tax law,\ntheir interpretation and resolution of tax audits could significantly impact the income taxes provided in our\nconsolidated financial statements. Assumptions, judgments and estimates relative to the amount of deferred income\ntaxes take into account future taxable income. Any of the assumptions, judgments and estimates mentioned above\ncould cause the actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates.\nCritical accounting estimates and the related assumptions are evaluated periodically as conditions warrant, and\nchanges to such estimates are recorded as new information or changed conditions require.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies” in Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.",

          "content": "Item 7A. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nForeign Currency and Exchange Risk\nThe majority of our cash generated from revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, with a portion of our revenue from\namounts denominated in foreign currencies. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies of the\njurisdictions in which we conduct our operations, which are primarily in Australia, China, Europe and the United\nStates. Our results of current and future operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates. For the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, 20.0% ,\n22.6% and 20.2% of our revenue, respectively and 10.8%,\n60\nTable of Contents\n16.8% and 11.9% of our expenses, respectively were denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The effect\nof a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a\nmaterial impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023,\n2022, and 2021. As the impact of foreign currency exchange rates has not been material to our historical operating\nresults, we have not entered into derivative or hedging transactions, but we may do so in the future if our\nexposure to foreign currency becomes more significant.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $1.1 billion and marketable securities of $4.3 billion as of January 31, 2023.\nCash and cash equivalents consist of bank deposits, money market funds and high-grade commercial paper, and agency\nbonds. Our marketable securities generally consist of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate and\nother debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. The cash and cash equivalents and\nmarketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Such interest-earning instruments carry a degree of\ninterest rate risk. The primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing\nincome without significantly increasing risk. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes\nand have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Due to the short-\nterm nature of our investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks\ndue to changes in interest rates. A hypothetical 10% change in interest rates during any of the periods presented\nwould not have had a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended\nJanuary 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021.\n61\nTable of Contents",

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as\nof January 31, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the\nCommittee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects,\nthe financial position of the Company as of January 31, 2023 and 2022, and the results of its operations and its\ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended January 31, 2023, in conformity with U.S. generally\naccepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective\ninternal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023 based on criteria established in Internal Control\n– Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective\ninternal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over\nfinancial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting.\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm\nregistered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be\nindependent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable\nrules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and\nperform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of\nmaterial misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial\nreporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material\nmisstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures\nthat respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts\nand disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting\nprinciples used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the\nconsolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an\nunderstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and\ntesting and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe\nthat our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance\nregarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting\nincludes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,\naccurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide\nreasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are\nbeing made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide\nreasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of\nthe company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n63\nTable of Contents\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect\nmisstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies\nor procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated\nfinancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1)\nrelates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our\nespecially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not\nalter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by\ncommunicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the\naccounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nSufficiency of Audit Evidence Over Revenue\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s revenue is principally\nderived from the sale of subscriptions to the Company’s video communications platform. The Company recorded $4,393\nmillion of revenue for the year ended January 31, 2023.\nWe identified the evaluation of sufficiency of audit evidence over revenue as a critical audit matter. This matter\nrequired especially subjective auditor judgment because the Company’s revenue recognition process is highly\nautomated and is reliant upon a number of customized and proprietary information technology (IT) systems.\nInvolvement of IT professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to assist with the performance\nof certain procedures and determination of IT applications subject to testing.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We applied auditor\njudgment to determine the nature and extent of procedures to be performed over revenue. We evaluated the design and\ntested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to revenue recognition. This included\ncertain controls related to the Company’s general information technology and application controls related to the\nsystems utilized within the Company’s revenue recognition process. We involved IT professionals with specialized\nskills and knowledge, who assisted in testing the IT controls of the various systems interacting with the Company’s\nrevenue recognition process. We recalculated revenue for system-generated sales transactions during the year using\na software audit tool. For a sample of transactions, we compared the amounts recognized for consistency with\nunderlying documentation, including contracts with customers and cash receipts. Additionally, for the same sample\nof transactions, we recalculated the amount of revenue recognized in the period based on the terms of the\narrangement and the satisfaction of the underlying performance obligation. In addition, we evaluated the\nsufficiency of audit evidence obtained over revenue by assessing the results of procedures performed.\n/s/ KPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since

of Contents\nZOOM VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nSummary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\nDescription of Business\nZoom Video Communications, Inc. and its subsidiaries (collectively, “Zoom,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”)\nconnect people through our platform of core unified communications and collaboration platform, which frictionlessly\nbrings together video, phone, chat, and webinars, and enables meaningful experiences across disparate devices and\nlocations. We were incorporated in the state of Delaware in April 2011, and are headquartered in San Jose,\nCalifornia.\nFiscal Year\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal year 2023, for example, refer to the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 31, 2023.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles in the United States of America (“GAAP”) and include the accounts of Zoom Video\nCommunications, Inc., its subsidiaries, and a variable interest entity for which we are the primary beneficiary.\nAll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates\nand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and\nliabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses\nduring the reporting period. Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions include, but are not\nlimited to, the estimated expected benefit period for deferred contract acquisition costs, stock-based compensation\nexpense, the fair value of marketable securities, acquired intangible assets and goodwill, the valuation of\ndeferred income tax assets and uncertain tax positions, and accruals and contingencies. Actual results could\nmaterially differ from those estimates.\nConcentration of Risks\nOur financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, and accounts receivable. We maintain our cash, cash\nequivalents, marketable securities, and restricted cash with high-quality financial institutions with investment-\ngrade ratings. A majority of the cash balances are with U.S. banks and are insured to the extent defined by the\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\nNo single customer accounted for more than 10% of accounts receivable at January 31, 2023 or 2022. No single\ncustomer accounted for 10% or more of total revenue during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash in banks and highly liquid investments, primarily money market funds,\npurchased with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted cash consists of certificates of deposit collateralizing our operating leases and cash from proceeds\nfrom international employees’ sales of our common stock, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current\nassets and other assets, noncurrent in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAs of January 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $ 13.1million and $ 10.2million, respectively, of cash from proceeds from\ninternational employees’ sales of our common stock. The amount is held in our bank account until it is remitted to\nthe employees and the tax authorities. Due to the restrictions on the use of the funds in the bank account, we have\nclassified the amount as restricted cash included in prepaid expenses and other current assets, and a corresponding\namount is included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\nWe are exposed to credit losses primarily through our accounts receivable and investments in available-for-sale\ndebt securities. See Note 3 for additional information related to our available-for-sale debt securities.\n71\nTable of Contents\nAccounts receivable, net\nAccounts receivable are recorded for invoiced amounts and amounts for which revenue has been recognized, but not\ninvoiced, net of allowances. Our short-term accounts receivable consist of the following:\nAs of January       As of January\n31, 2023            31, 2022\n-in thousands\nAccounts receivable, gross           $        590,610    $        444,369\nLess: Allowance for credit losses             -24,900             -17,000\nLess: Allowance for returns                    -8,306              -7,696\nAccounts receivable, net             $        557,404    $        419,673\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses for expected uncollectible accounts receivable, which is recorded as an\noffset to accounts receivable, and changes in such are classified as general and administrative expense in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. The allowance for credit losses is based on management’s estimate for\nexpected credit losses for outstanding accounts receivable. We determine expected credit losses based on historical\nwrite-off experience, an analysis of the aging of outstanding receivables, customer payment patterns, the\nestablishment of specific reserves for customers in an adverse financial condition, and adjust based upon our\nexpectations of changes in macroeconomic conditions that may impact the collectibility of outstanding receivables,\nincluding noncurrent accounts receivable. We also consider current market conditions and reasonable and supportable\nforecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss data. We reassess the adequacy of\nthe allowance for credit losses each reporting period. Furthermore, the allowance for sales returns is recorded as\nan offset to accounts receivable, and changes to the allowance are classified as a reduction in revenue in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. We estimate returns from sales to customers based on historical chargebacks\nand return rates.\nFor the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023, our assessment considered the recent changes in macroeconomic\nconditions such as inflation, recessionary and uncertain environments, and fluctuations in foreign currency\nexchange rates has on our estimates of credit and collectibility trends. Below is a rollforward of our allowance\nfor credit losses for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2023.\nJanuary 31, 2023       January 31, 2022\n-in thousands\nBalance as of beginning of year    $            17,000    $            20,500\nProvision for credit losses                     45,211                 32,587\nWrite-offs                                     -37,311                -36,087\nBalance as of end of year          $            24,900    $            17,000\nAvailable-for-sale Investments\nAvailable-for-sale investments consist primarily of high-grade commercial paper, agency bonds, corporate bonds,\ncorporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, and treasury bills. We classify our\nmarketable securities as available-for-sale at the time of purchase and reevaluate such classification at each\nbalance sheet date. We may sell these securities at any time for use in current operations even if they have not\nyet reached maturity. As a result, we classify our securities, including those with maturities beyond 12 months, as\ncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets. We carry these securities at fair value and record unrealized\ngains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, which is reflected as a component of\nstockholders’ equity. We evaluate our securities with unrealized loss positions as to whether the declines in fair\nvalue were due to credit losses, and record the portion of impairment relating to the credit losses through\nallowance for credit losses limited to the amount that fair value was less than the amortized cost basis. Realized\ngains and losses from the sale of marketable securities are determined based on the specific identification method.\nRealized gains and losses are reported in other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nStrategic Investments\nWe hold strategic investments in publicly held equity securities and privately held debt and equity securities in\nwhich we do not have a controlling interest. Publicly held equity securities are measured using quoted prices in\ntheir respective active markets with changes recorded through gains on strategic investments, net in the\nconsolidated statements of operations. Privately held equity securities without a readily determinable fair value\nare recorded at cost and adjusted for impairments and observable price changes with a same or similar security from\nthe same issuer (i.e. using the measurement alternative) and are recorded through (losses) gains on strategic\ninvestments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\n72\nTable of Contents\nIf, based on the terms of these publicly traded and privately held securities, we determine that we exercise\nsignificant influence on the entity to which these securities relate, we will apply the equity method of accounting\nfor such investments. Privately held equity securities that are accounted for under the equity method are measured\nat cost less any impairment, plus or minus our share of equity method investee income or loss, which is reported in\n(losses) gains on strategic investments, net in the consolidated statements of operations.\nPrivately held debt securities are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated\nother comprehensive (loss) income on the consolidated balance sheets.\nOn a quarterly basis, we assess our privately held debt and equity securities in our strategic investment portfolio\nfor indicators for impairment.As of January 31, 2023, we recognized an immaterial amount of impairment to our\nprivately held debt and equity securities.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a\nliability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between\nmarket participants on the measurement date. We measure financial assets and liabilities at fair value at each\nreporting period using a fair value hierarchy, which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and\nminimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. A financial instrument’s classification within\nthe fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nThree levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1—Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted\nprices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or\ncan be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\nLevel 3—Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair\nvalue of the assets or liabilities.\nFinancial instruments consist of cash equivalents, restricted cash, marketable securities, accounts receivable, and\naccounts payable. Cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities are stated at fair value on a\nrecurring basis. Accounts receivable and accounts payable are stated at their carrying value, which approximates\nfair value due to the short time to the expected receipt or payment date.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment, net, are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and\namortization are calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective\nassets, determined to be threeto five years. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the remaining\nlease term or the estimated useful life of five years. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as\nincurred. Significant improvements and betterments that substantially enhance the life of an asset are capitalized.\nSoftware Development Costs\nWe capitalize certain development costs related to our unified communications and collaboration platform during the\napplication development stage as long as it is probable the project will be completed, and the software will be\nused to perform the function intended. Capitalized software development costs are recorded as part of property and\nequipment, net. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as\nincurred. Capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the software’s\nestimated useful life, which is generally three years, and are recorded in cost of revenue in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis and test for impairment\nwhenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets. We have\ncapitalized $ 18.0million, $ 20.2million, and $ 19.4million of software development costs during the fiscal years\nended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nLeases\nAll lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets\nand operating lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. For short-term leases (an initial term of 12 months\nor less), an ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded and we record rent expense in our\nconsolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and record variable lease\npayments as incurred. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease\nterm, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms\nmay include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is\n73\nTable of Contents\nreasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at\nthe commencement date based on the present value of fixed payments not yet paid over the lease term. We use our\nincremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the lease\nliabilities as our leases generally do not provide an implicit rate. Our incremental borrowing rate is estimated to\napproximate the interest rate on a collateralized basis with similar terms and payments, in an economic environment\nwhere the leased asset is located. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments\nmade at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. We reassess the lease term if and\nwhen a significant event or change in circumstances occurs within our control. We currently do not have any finance\nleases.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nWe evaluate long-lived assets or asset groups for impairment whenever events indicate that the carrying value of an\nasset or asset group may not be recoverable based on expected future cash flows attributable to that asset or asset\ngroup. Recoverability of assets held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or an asset\ngroup to estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the\ncarrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds estimated undiscounted future cash flows, then an impairment\ncharge would be recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset or asset group over its fair\nvalue. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less costs to\nsell.There were noimpairment charges recognized related to long-lived assets during the fiscal years ended January\n31, 2023, 2022, or 2021.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for our business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other\nthings, allocation of the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and\nliabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The excess of the fair value of\npurchase consideration over the values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. When\ndetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, we make estimates and assumptions,\nespecially with respect to intangible assets. Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be\nreasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, as a result, actual results may differ from\nestimates. During the measurement period, not to exceed one year from the date of acquisition, we may record\nadjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with a corresponding offset to goodwill if new\ninformation is obtained related to facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. After the\nmeasurement period, any subsequent adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAcquisition costs, such as legal and consulting fees, are expensed as incurred.\nUncertain tax positions and tax-related valuation allowances are initially established in connection with a\nbusiness combination as of the acquisition date. We continue to collect information and reevaluate these estimates\nand assumptions quarterly. We will record any adjustments to our preliminary estimates to goodwill, provided that\nit is within the one-year measurement period.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nGoodwill amounts are not amortized, but rather tested for impairment at least annually or more often if\ncircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is considered impaired if the\ncarrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value. We have onereporting unit and as a result, goodwill\nhas been assigned to the single reporting unit. We conducted our annual impairment test of goodwill in the fourth\nquarter of fiscal year 2023 and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required.\nIntangible assets consist of acquired identifiable intangible assets resulting from business combinations, as well\nas other intangible assets purchased outside of a business combination, such as domains and intellectual property\naddresses. Finite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized on a straight-line\nbasis over their estimated useful lives. We routinely evaluate the estimated remaining useful lives of our finite-\nlived intangible assets and whether events or changes in circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period\nof amortization. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value and are not amortized. We review the\nuseful lives of indefinite-lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and\ncircumstances continue to support the indefinite useful life classification. If we determine that the life of an\nintangible asset is no longer indefinite, that asset would be tested for impairment and amortized prospectively\nover its estimated remaining useful life. There were no impairment charges to acquired intangible assets during the\nfiscal year ended January 31, 2023.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe derive our revenue primarily from subscription agreements with customers for access to our unified\ncommunications and collaboration platform and services. We also provide other services, which include professional\nservices, consulting\n74\nTable of Contents\nservices, and online event hosting, which were immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. Revenue is\nrecognized when a customer obtains control of promised services. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the\nconsideration that we expect to receive in exchange for these services over the contract term which can include a\nfree period discount. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps:\n1. Identification of the contract, or contracts, with the customer\nWe determine a contract with a customer to exist when the contract is approved, each party’s rights regarding the\nservices to be transferred can be identified, the payment terms for the services can be identified, the customer\nhas the ability and intent to pay, and the contract has commercial substance. At contract inception, we will\nevaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract and whether the\ncombined or single contract includes more than one performance obligation. We apply judgment in determining the\ncustomer’s ability and intent to pay, which is based on a variety of factors, including the customer’s historical\npayment experience or, in the case of a new customer, credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n2. Identification of the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations committed in a contract are identified based on the services that will be transferred to\nthe customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the service either on\nits own or together with other resources that are readily available from third parties or from us, and are distinct\nin the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the services or products is separately identifiable from\nother promises in the contract. Promised services or products under which both of these two criteria are not met\nare recognized as a combined, single performance obligation. Our performance obligations primarily relate to access\nto our unified communications and collaboration platform, which consists of one or more software-based services.\nOur customers do not have the ability to take possession of our software, and through access to our platform, we\nprovide a series of distinct software-based services that are satisfied over the term of the subscription.\n3. Determination of the transaction price\nThe transaction price is determined based on the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for\ntransferring services to the customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price if, in our\njudgment, it is probable that a significant future reversal of cumulative revenue recognized under the contract\nwill not occur. None of our contracts contain a significant financing component. Revenue is recognized net of any\ntaxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental entities (e.g., sales and other\nindirect taxes).\nOur unified communications and collaboration platform and related services are typically warranted to perform in a\nprofessional manner that will comply with the terms of the subscription agreements. In addition, we include\nservice-level commitments to our customers warranting certain levels of uptime reliability and performance and\npermitting those customers to receive credits in the event that we fail to meet those service levels. These credits\nrepresent a form of variable consideration. We have not provided any material refunds related to these agreements\nin the consolidated financial statements during the periods presented.\n4. Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract\nContracts that contain multiple performance obligations require an allocation of the transaction price to each\nperformance obligation based on each performance obligation’s relative standalone selling price. Our contracts with\nmultiple performance obligations are generally sold over the same subscription term and have the same pattern of\ntransfer to the customer, and so they are accounted for as one combined performance obligation in the context of\nthe contract. Accordingly, the transaction price is allocated to this single performance obligation.\n5. Recognition of the revenue when, or as, a performance obligation is satisfied\nRevenue is recognized at the time the related performance obligation is satisfied by transferring the control of\nthe promised service to a customer. Revenue is recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration that we\nexpect to receive in exchange for those services. Fees for access to our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and related services are subscription revenue and are considered one performance obligation, and the\nrelated revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period as we satisfy the performance obligation.\nProfessional services are time-based arrangements and revenue is recognized as these services are performed. Fees\nfor services represent less than 2% of total revenue during the periods presented.\n75\nTable of Contents\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue primarily consists of costs related to hosting our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform and providing general operating support services to our customers. These costs are composed of co-located\ndata center costs, third-party cloud hosting costs, integrated third-party PSTN services, personnel-related\nexpenses, amortization of capitalized software development costs and acquired intangible assets, royalty payments,\nand allocated overhead costs. Indirect overhead costs associated with corporate facilities and related\ndepreciation, health care benefits, training, and other employee benefits are allocated to cost of revenue and\noperating expenses based on applicable headcount.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs include personnel-related expenses associated with our engineering personnel and\nconsultants responsible for the design, development, and testing of our unified communications and collaboration\nplatform, depreciation of equipment used in research and development, and allocated overhead costs. Research and\ndevelopment costs are expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs are expensed as incurred in sales and marketing expense and amounted to $ 64.7million, $\n40.9million, and $ 34.8million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense related to stock awards (including stock options, RSUs, and ESPP) is measured\nbased on the fair value of the awards granted and recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the\nrequisite service period.\nThe fair value of each option and ESPP award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes option pricing\nmodel. The Black-Scholes option pricing model requires the use of assumptions, including the fair value of the\nunderlying common stock, the expected term of the award, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock,\nrisk-free interest rates, and the expected dividend yield of our common stock.\nThe fair value of each RSU award is based on the fair value of the underlying common stock as of the grant date.\nThe assumptions used to determine the fair value of the stock awards represent management’s best estimates. These\nestimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. We account for forfeitures\nas they occur instead of estimating the number of awards expected to be forfeited.\nForeign Currency\nThe functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, monetary assets and\nliabilities of our foreign subsidiaries are remeasured into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the\nreporting date, non-monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at historical rates, and revenue and expenses\nare remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each reporting period.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and\nliabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and\nliabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are\nexpected to reverse.\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we\nbelieve it is more likely than not that they will not be realized. We consider all available positive and negative\nevidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income,\ntax-planning strategies, carryback potential if permitted under the tax law, and results of recent operations.\nWe record uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes on the basis of a two-step process in\nwhich (1) we determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained on the basis of\nthe technical merits of the position and (2) for those tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition\nthreshold, we recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 percent likely to be realized upon\nultimate settlement with the related tax authority. We consider many factors when evaluating our uncertain tax\npositions, which involve significant judgment and may require periodic adjustments. The resolution of these\nuncertain tax positions in a manner inconsistent with management's expectations could have a material impact on our\nconsolidated financial statements. We recognize interest and penalties related\n76\nTable of Contents\nto uncertain tax positions as a component of our provision for income taxes. Accrued interest and penalties are\nincluded with the related tax liability.\nNet Income Per Share Attributable to Common Stockholders\nWe calculate our net income per share attributable to Class A and Class B common stock using the two-class method\nrequired for companies with participating securities. We consider our convertible preferred stock and unvested\ncommon stock, which includes early exercised stock options, to be participating securities as holders of such\nsecurities have non-forfeitable dividend rights in the event of our declaration of a dividend for shares of common\nstock.\nDistributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities are subtracted from net income in\ndetermining net income attributable to common stockholders. Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net\nincome attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares of our Class A and Class B\ncommon stock outstanding.\nThe diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by giving effect to all dilutive\nsecurities. Diluted net income per share attributable to common stockholders is computed by dividing the resulting\nnet income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of fully diluted common shares\noutstanding.\nSegment Information\nWe operate in oneoperating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which\nseparate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, who is our Chief\nExecutive Officer (“CEO”), in deciding how to allocate resources and assessing performance. Our chief operating\ndecision maker allocates resources and assesses performance based upon consolidated financial information.\nRevenue by geographical region can be found in the revenue recognition disclosures in Note 2 below.

The guidance will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023 and interim periods\nwithin those fiscal years. We early adopted ASU No. 2022-03 for the fiscal year ending January 31, 2023. Adoption\nof the ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and\nContract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires an acquirer in a business combination to\nrecognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification\nTopic 606.

Accounts\nreceivable are recorded when we contractually have the right to consideration. In some arrangements, a right to\nconsideration for our performance under the customer contract may occur before invoicing to the customer, resulting\nin an unbilled accounts receivable. The amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within accounts receivable,\nnet of allowances on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 91.6million and $ 59.7million as of January 31, 2023 and\n2022, respectively, and the amount of unbilled accounts receivable included within other assets, noncurrent on the\nconsolidated balance sheets was immaterial as of January 31, 2023 and 2022.\nContract liabilities consist of deferred revenue. Revenue is deferred when we have the right to invoice in advance\nof performance under a customer contract. The current portion of deferred revenue balances is recognized over the\nnext 12 months. The amount of revenue recognized during the fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021\nthat was included in deferred revenue at the beginning of each period was $ 1,140.7million, $ 858.2million, and $\n222.0million, respectively.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nThe terms of our subscription agreements are monthly, annual, and multiyear and we may bill for the full term in\nadvance or on an annual, quarterly, or monthly basis, depending on the billing terms with customers. As of January\n31, 2023, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to our remaining performance obligations was $\n3,434.4million, which consists of both billed consideration in the amount of $ 1,308.4million and unbilled\nconsideration in the amount of $ 2,126.0million that we expect to recognize as revenue. We expect to recognize 56%\nof our remaining performance obligations as revenue over the next 12months and the remainder thereafter.\nCost to Obtain a Contract\nWe primarily capitalize sales commissions and associated payroll taxes paid to internal sales personnel that are\nincremental costs from the acquisition of customer contracts. These costs are recorded as deferred contract\nacquisition costs in the consolidated balance sheets. We determine whether costs should be deferred based on our\nsales compensation plans and if the commissions are incremental and would not have occurred absent the customer\ncontract.\nSales commissions paid upon the initial acquisition of a customer contract are amortized over an estimated period\nof benefit of three years, which is typically greater than the contractual terms of the customer contracts. We do\nnot pay sales commissions upon contract renewal. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis commensurate\nwith the pattern of revenue recognition. We determine the period of benefit for commissions paid for the\nacquisition of the initial customer contract by taking into consideration the initial estimated customer life and\nthe technological life of our unified communications and collaboration platform and related significant features.\nAmortization of deferred contract acquisition costs is included in sales and marketing expense in the consolidated\nstatements of operations.\nWe periodically review these deferred contract acquisition costs to determine whether events or changes in\ncircumstances have occurred that could impact the period of benefit. There were no impairment losses recorded\nduring the periods presented.\n78\nTable of Contents\nThe following table represents a rollforward of deferred contract acquisition costs:\nYear Ended January 31,\n2023           2022\n-in thousands\nBeginning balance                       $                 363,980    $   293,892\nAdditions to deferred contract                            298,629        247,371\nacquisition costs\nAmortization of deferred contract                        -259,368       -177,283\nacquisition costs\nEnding balance                          $                 403,241    $   363,980\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,\ncurrent (to be amortized in next 12     $                 223,250    $   199,266\nmonths)\nDeferred contract acquisition costs,                      179,991        164,714\nnoncurrent\nTotal deferred contract acquisition     $                 403,241    $   363,980\ncosts\n3.

We classify our commercial\npaper, agency bonds, corporate and other debt securities, U.S. government agency securities, treasury bills, and\ncertificates of deposit within Level 2 because they are valued using inputs other than quoted prices that are\ndirectly or indirectly observable in the market, including readily available pricing sources for the identical\nunderlying security, which may not be actively traded. We classify our privately held debt securities as Level 3\ndue to the lack of relevant observable market data over fair value inputs, such as the probability weighting of the\nvarious scenarios that can impact settlement of the arrangement.\n81\nTable of Contents\n5. Business Combinations\nOn May 19, 2022, we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding share capital of Solvvy, Inc., a private technology\ncompany specializing in customer support automation, for an all-cash purchase consideration of $ 121.2million. The\nacquisition adds to our customer service capabilities and enhances our integrated platform by providing\nconversational AI capabilities. The acquisition has been accounted for as a business combination.\nIn allocating the purchase consideration, $ 95.0million was attributed to goodwill, $ 26.7million to intangible\nassets (consisting of $ 12.0million to developed technology and $ 14.7million to customer relationships), and $\n0.5million to other net liabilities acquired. The goodwill amount represents synergies related to our existing\nproducts expected to be realized from the acquisition and assembled workforce. The associated goodwill is not\ndeductible for tax purposes.\nAt the date of the acquisition, the developed technology and customer relationships both had an estimated useful\nlife of 5.0years, and both are amortized using the straight-line method over their respective estimated useful\nlives. Amortization expense of developed technology is recorded within cost of revenue in the consolidated\nstatements of operations and amortization expense of customer relationships is recorded within sales and marketing\nin the consolidated statements of operations. As of January 31, 2023, the developed technology and customer\nrelationships both had a remaining useful life of 4.3years.\nTransaction costs incurred in connection with the acquisition were immaterial. The results of operations of Solvvy,\nInc., which are not material, have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of the\nacquisition. Pro forma and historical results of operations of the company have not been presented, as the results\ndo not have a material effect on any of the periods presented in our consolidated statements of operations.\n6.

HaaS was immaterial to our consolidated financial\nstatements. Many of our leases contain oneor more options to extend.

Commitments and Contingencies\nNon-cancelable Purchase Obligations\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into non-cancelable purchase commitments with various parties to\npurchase primarily software-based services. As of January 31, 2023, we had outstanding non-cancelable purchase\nobligations with a term of less than 12 months of $ 191.9million and non-cancelable purchase obligations with a\nterm 12 months or longer of $ 107.0million.\nIndemnifications and Contingency\nOur agreements with certain larger customers include certain provisions for indemnifying customers against\nliabilities if our services infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights. It is not possible to determine\nthe maximum potential amount under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior\nindemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that may be involved in each particular agreement. To\ndate, we have not incurred any material costs as a result of such provisions and have not accrued any liabilities\nrelated to such obligations in our consolidated financial statements.\nIn addition, we have indemnification agreements with our directors and our executive officers that require us,\namong other things, to indemnify our directors and executive officers for costs associated with any fees, expenses,\njudgments, fines, and settlement amounts incurred by any of those persons in any action or proceeding to which any\nof those persons is, or is threatened to be, made a party by reason of the person’s service as a director or\nofficer, including any action by us, arising out of that person’s services as our director or officer or that\nperson’s services provided to any other company or enterprise at our request. We maintain director and officer\ninsurance coverage that may enable us to recover a portion of any future indemnification amounts paid. To date,\nthere have been no claims under any of our directors’ and executive officers’ indemnification provisions.\nSales and Other Tax Liabilities\nWe conduct operations in many tax jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions, non-income-based taxes, such as sales and\nuse tax and other indirect taxes, are assessed on our operations. Although we are diligent in collecting and\nremitting such taxes, there is uncertainty as to what constitutes sufficient presence for a jurisdiction to levy\ntaxes, fees, and surcharges for sales made over the Internet. As of January 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded sales\nand other tax liabilities of $ 76.2million and $ 87.2million, respectively, of which $ 33.9million and $\n33.3million are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, respectively, and $ 42.3million and $\n53.9million are included in other liabilities, noncurrent, respectively, in our consolidated\n86\nTable of Contents\nbalance sheets, based on our best estimate of the probable liability for the loss contingency incurred as of those\ndates. Our estimate of a probable outcome under the loss contingency is based on analysis of our sales and\nmarketing activities, revenue subject to sales tax, and applicable regulations in applicable jurisdictions in each\nperiod. No significant adjustments to the sales and other tax liabilities have been recognized in the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements for changes to the assumptions underlying the estimate; however, changes in our\nassumptions may occur in the future as we obtain new information, which can result in adjustments to the recorded\nliability.\nOther Contingencies\nIn June 2020 we received a grand jury subpoena from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for Eastern\nDistrict of New York (“EDNY”), which requested information regarding our interactions with foreign governments and\nforeign political parties, including the Chinese government, as well as information regarding storage of and access\nto user data, the development and implementation of Zoom’s privacy policies, and the actions we took relating to\nvideoconference commemorations of the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square democracy protests. In July 2020, we\nreceived subpoenas from the Department of Justice’s U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of California\n(“NDCA”) and the SEC. Both subpoenas seek documents and information relating to various security, data protection\nand privacy matters, including our encryption, and our statements relating thereto, as well as calculation of usage\nmetrics and related public statements. In addition, the NDCA subpoena seeks information relating to any contacts\nbetween our employees and representatives of the Chinese government, and any attempted or successful influence by\nany foreign government in our policies, procedures, practices, and actions as they relate to users in the United\nStates. We have since received additional subpoenas from EDNY and NDCA seeking related information. We are fully\ncooperating with all of these investigations and have been conducting our own thorough internal investigation.\nThese investigations are ongoing, and we do not know when they will be completed, which facts we will ultimately\ndiscover as a result of the investigations, or what actions the government may or may not take. We cannot predict\nthe outcome of these investigations, and a negative outcome in any or all of these matters could cause us to incur\nsubstantial fines, penalties, or other financial exposure, as well as reputational harm.\nLegal Proceedings\nOn April 7, 2020, and April 8, 2020, securities class action complaints were filed against us and twoof our\nofficers in the United States District Court for the NDCA. The plaintiffs are purported stockholders of ours. The\ncomplaints allege, among other things, that we violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act of 1934, and\nRule 10b-5 by making false and misleading statements and omissions of material fact about our data privacy and\nsecurity measures. The complaints seek unspecified damages, interest, fees, and costs. On May 18, 2020, the actions\nwere consolidated. On November 4, 2020, the court appointed a lead plaintiff. On December 23, 2020, the lead\nplaintiff filed a consolidated complaint. We filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint on May 20, 2021.\nPlaintiff filed an opposition to our motion to dismiss on July 9, 2021. Our reply in support of the motion to\ndismiss was filed on August 9, 2021. On February 16, 2022, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our\nmotion to dismiss. On March 14, 2022, we moved for reconsideration of the court’s ruling on the motion to dismiss.\nOn March 22, 2022, the court ordered plaintiff to respond to our motion, which plaintiff did on March 29, 2022. On\nApril 22, 2022, we answered the complaint.\nOn June 11, 2020 and July 30, 2020, purported shareholder derivative complaints were filed in the United States\nDistrict Court for the District of Delaware. The first complaint names as defendants nineof our officers and\ndirectors and the second complaint names eightof our officers and directors. The lawsuits assert state and federal\nclaims and are based on the same alleged misstatements as the shareholder class action complaint. The lawsuits\naccuse our board of directors of failing to exercise reasonable and prudent supervision over our management,\npolicies, practices, and internal controls. The plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages on behalf of us as\nwell as governance reforms. On September 25, 2020, the derivative cases were consolidated. The consolidated case is\nstayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action. On October 27, 2021, a third\nsubstantially identical lawsuit was filed in the same court against the same defendants, seeking unspecified\nmonetary damages and governance reforms. On November 17, 2021, all threederivative lawsuits were consolidated and\nremain stayed pending resolution of the motion to dismiss the securities class action.\nWe believe these lawsuits are without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves against them. Given the\nuncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the cases, and the legal standards that must be met for, among\nother things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably possible loss or\nrange of loss that may result from these actions.\nBeginning on March 30, 2020, multiple putative class actions were filed against us in various U.S. federal district\ncourts and state courts relating to our alleged privacy and security practices, including alleged data sharing with\nthird parties (the “U.S. Privacy Class Actions”). The plaintiffs claim violations of a variety of state consumer\nprotection and privacy laws, and also assert state constitutional and common law claims, such as negligence and\nunjust enrichment. The U.S. Privacy Class Actions seek to certify both nationwide and state-specific classes of\nindividuals using our services in certain time periods. The plaintiffs\n87\nTable of Contents\nseek various forms of injunctive and monetary relief, including restitution, statutory and actual damages, punitive\ndamages, and attorneys’ fees. The federal cases have been transferred to and consolidated in the NDCA with our\nconsent; lead plaintiffs’ counsel have been appointed; and plaintiffs filed their first amended consolidated class\naction complaint on October 28, 2020. On March 11, 2021, the court granted in part, and denied in part, our motion\nto dismiss, and gave plaintiffs leave to amend. On July 30, 2021, we entered into a settlement agreement with\nplaintiffs to settle the action on a classwide basis, and plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the\nsettlement with the court on July 31, 2021. On October 21, 2021, the Court preliminarily approved the settlement.\nUnder the terms of the settlement, we have paid $ 85.0million into an escrow account that will be used to pay\nclaims filed by settlement class members, attorneys’ fees and expenses, administrative costs, and service payments\nto plaintiffs. On April 22, 2022, the Court granted final approval of the settlement. On May 19, 2022, twoobjectors\nto the settlement appealed the Court's final approval order. On May 20, 2022, a third objector appealed the Court’s\nfinal approval order. On October 17, 2022, we, plaintiffs, and all threeobjector-appellants agreed to settle the\nappeals, and on December 16, 2022, the Court approved the settlements. On January 13, 2023, an appeal of the order\napproving the objector-appellant settlements was filed, which is still pending. On May 30, 2022, a new class action\nwas filed against us in the NDCA raising privacy claims similar to those raised in the U.S. Privacy Class Actions\non behalf of a putative class of users of Zoom who reside in Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and the United Kingdom\nand who are not members of the settlement class in the U.S. Privacy Class Actions. On July 12, 2022, we moved to\ndismiss this new class action and on February 14, 2023, the Court granted the motion to dismiss but allowed\nplaintiffs leave to amend. We believe this lawsuit is without merit, and we are vigorously defending ourselves\nagainst it. Given the uncertainty of litigation, the preliminary stage of the case, and the legal standard must be\nmet for among other things, class certification and success on the merits, we cannot estimate the reasonably\npossible loss or range of loss that may result from these actions.\nIn addition, from time to time, we are involved in various other legal proceedings arising from the normal course\nof business activities. We are not presently a party to any other such litigation the outcome of which, we believe,\nif determined adversely to us, would individually, or taken together, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, operating results, cash flows, or financial condition. Defending such proceedings is costly and can\nimpose a significant burden on management and employees. We may receive unfavorable preliminary or interim rulings\nin the course of litigation, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained.\n10. Stockholders’ Equity and Equity Incentive Plans\nPreferred Stock\nIn connection with the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became effective,\nwhich authorized the issuance of 200,000,000shares of undesignated preferred stock with a par value of $ 0.001with\nrights and preferences, including voting rights, designated from time to time by our board of directors. As of\nJanuary 31, 2023 and 2022, there were noshares of convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding.\nDual-Class Common Stock Structure\nIn November 2018, we implemented a dual class common stock structure pursuant to which all the then-outstanding\nshares of our common stock were reclassified as Class B common stock and a new class of Class A common stock was\nauthorized. The Class A common stock is entitled to onevote per share and the Class B common stock is entitled to\n10votes per share. The Class A and Class B common stock have the same dividend and liquidation rights. Each share\nof Class B common stock will automatically convert into oneshare of Class A common stock upon (a) any transfer of\nsuch share, except for certain permitted transfers described in our amended and restated certificate of\nincorporation and (b) the death of the holder of such share. In addition, each share of Class B common stock will\nbe automatically converted into oneshare of Class A common stock upon the earliest of (a) the date that is six\nmonthsfollowing the death or incapacity of Eric S. Yuan (our CEO), (b) the date that is six monthsfollowing the\ndate that Mr. Yuan is no longer providing services to us or his employment is terminated for cause, (c) the date\nspecified by the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock, voting\ntogether on an as-converted basis, and the holders of a majority of the then-outstanding shares of Class B common\nstock, voting as a separate class, and (d) the 15-year anniversary of the closing of our IPO. In connection with\nthe implementation of the dual-class common stock structure, each then-outstanding share of our convertible\npreferred stock became convertible into oneshare of Class B common stock, and all outstanding options to purchase\nshares of common stock became options to purchase an equivalent number of shares of Class B common stock.\nUpon the effectiveness of the amended and restated certificate of incorporation in November 2018, the number of\nshares of common stock that are authorized to be issued consisted of 320,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $\n0.001par value per share and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share. Class A and\nClass B common stock are collectively referred to as “common stock” throughout the notes to the consolidated\nfinancial statements, unless otherwise noted.\n88\nTable of Contents\nEquity Financing\nOn January 15, 2021, we completed our follow-on public offering, in which we issued and sold 5,882,353shares of our\nClass A common stock, including 735,294shares pursuant to the full exercise of the underwriter's option to purchase\nadditional shares, at $ 340.00per share. We received aggregate proceeds of $ 1,980.0million, net of underwriters’\ndiscounts and commissions. The other related offering costs were immaterial.\nCommon Stock\nUpon the completion of the IPO in April 2019, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation became\neffective, which also authorized the issuance of 2,000,000,000shares of Class A common stock, $ 0.001par value per\nshare and 300,000,000shares of Class B common stock, $ 0.001par value per share.\nWe have the following shares of Class A common stock reserved for future issuance:\nAs of January 31,\n2023          2022\nStock options outstanding                        4,800,616     6,195,205\nRSUs outstanding                                21,868,533     5,546,366\nESPP purchase rights outstanding                 2,851,856     1,784,687\nRemaining shares available for future           51,367,359    56,620,720\nissuance under the 2011 and 2019 plan\nRemaining shares available for future           11,930,797    10,685,867\nissuance under the ESPP\nTotal shares of Class A common stock            92,819,161    80,832,845\nreserved\nStock Repurchase Plan\nIn February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $ 1.0billion of our Class A\ncommon stock, which was completed in December 2022. During the year ended January 31, 2023, we purchased and\nsubsequently retired 11,170,907shares of our Class A common stock for an aggregate amount of $ 1.0billion.\nEquity Incentive Plans\nIn 2011, we adopted the 2011 Global Share Plan (“2011 Plan”), under which officers, employees, and consultants were\ngranted various forms of equity incentive compensation at the discretion of the board of directors, including stock\noptions and restricted stock awards. In connection with the IPO, the shares of Class B common stock remaining\navailable for issuance under the 2011 Plan became available for issuance for a corresponding number of shares of\nour Class A common stock under the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (“2019 Plan”), which is a successor to and\ncontinuation of our 2011 Plan.\nIn April 2019, we adopted the 2019 Plan, which became effective in connection with our IPO. Our 2019 Plan provides\nfor the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSU awards, performance awards, and other forms of\nawards. The awards generally vest over four years. The plan administrator determines the term of stock options\ngranted under the 2019 Plan, up to a maximum of 10years. The maximum number of shares of our Class A common stock\nthat may be issued under our 2019 Plan will not exceed 58,300,889shares of our Class A common stock, which is the\nsum of (1) 34,000,000new shares, plus (2) an additional number of shares not to exceed 24,300,889, consisting of\n(A) shares that remain available for the issuance of awards under our 2011 Plan as of immediately prior to the time\nour 2019 Plan becomes effective and (B) shares of Class B common stock subject to outstanding stock options or\nother stock awards granted under our 2011 Plan that, on or after the 2019 Plan became effective, terminate, or\nexpire prior to exercise or settlement; are not issued because the award is settled in cash; are forfeited because\nof the failure to vest; or are reacquired or withheld (or not issued) to satisfy a tax withholding obligation or\nthe purchase or exercise price, if any, as such shares become available from time to time.

Based on the available\nobjective evidence during the year ended January 31, 2023, we continue to believe that it is more likely than not\nthat the tax benefits of the U.K. net deferred tax assets may not be realized. Accordingly, we maintained a full\nvaluation allowance against the tax benefits of these net deferred tax assets. Based on the available objective\nevidence during the year ended January 31, 2023, we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits\nrelating to U.S. losses that are capital in nature may not be realized prior to expiration. Accordingly, we have\nmaintained a valuation allowance against these deferred tax assets. Based on the available objective evidence\nduring the year ended January 31, 2023, we believe that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits of certain\nstate net deferred tax assets may not be realized. Management applied significant judgement in assessing the\npositive and negative evidence available in the determination of the amount of certain state deferred tax assets\nthat were more likely than not to be realized in the future. Accordingly, given our current earnings, anticipated\nfuture earnings, and continued accumulation of certain state tax credits, we have recorded a full valuation\nallowance against the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets. We intend to maintain the applicable valuation\nallowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support a reversal of, or decrease in, the valuation\nallowance.\nAs of January 31, 2023, we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $ 22.9million for federal income\ntax purposes, $ 26.9million for state income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in the year 2033 if unused.\nWe also had certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $ 32.5million, which have an indefinite life.\nAs of January 31, 2023, we also had research and development credit carryforwards of approximately $ 1.2million for\nfederal income tax purposes and $ 22.8million for state income tax purposes. The federal research and development\ntax credits have a twenty-year carryover period while the state research and development tax credits carry forward\nindefinitely.\nThe federal and state net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to significant limitations under Section 382\nand Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and similar provisions under state law. Such provisions limit\nthe net operating loss carryforwards that may be used in any given year in the event of special occurrences,\nincluding significant ownership changes. We have completed a Section 382 review and determined that materially none\nof our operating losses will expire solely due to Section 382 limitation(s).\nWe indefinitely reinvest earnings from our foreign subsidiaries and therefore no deferred tax liability has been\nrecognized on the basis difference created by such earnings. We have not provided foreign withholding taxes for any\nundistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries.\n93\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of total unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nYear Ended January 31,\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits (in thousands)                         2023         2022         2021\nBalance, beginning of year                  $                  19,171    $  14,884    $   8,106\nTax Positions taken in prior year:\nGross increases                                                   877            —          314\nGross decreases                                                     —       -3,764            —\nTax Positions taken in current year:\nGross increases                                                10,547        8,211        6,001\nGross decreases                                                     —            —            —\nLapse of Statute of Limitations                                  -191         -160         -422\nAcquisitions                                                        —            —          885\nBalance, end of year                        $                  30,404    $  19,171    $  14,884\nAs of January 31, 2023, gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 30.4million ($\n32.5million total, including $ 1.6million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2022, gross\nunrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions were $ 19.2million ($ 19.6million total, including $\n0.4million associated with interest and penalties). As of January 31, 2021, gross unrecognized tax benefits related\nto uncertain tax positions were $ 14.9million ($ 15.0million total, including $ 0.1million associated with interest\nand penalties). We recognized approximately $ 1.6million, $ 0.4million, and $ 0.1million in potential interest and\npenalties associated with uncertain tax positions during fiscal years ended January 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021,\nrespectively. To the extent taxes are not assessed with respect to uncertain tax positions, substantially all\namounts accrued (including interest and penalties) will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall\nincome tax provision. Unrecognized tax benefits and associated accrued interest and penalties are included in our\nincome tax provision.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and various foreign\njurisdictions. As of January 31, 2023, all of the years remain open to examination by the federal and state tax\nauthorities, for three or four years from the tax year in which net operating losses or tax credits are utilized.\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.\nAlthough the timing of the resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe it is\nreasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change in the next 12 months.\nAs required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we are capitalizing research and development expenses incurred in\nfiscal year 2023. These expenses are capitalized and amortized over five years for domestic research and fifteen\nyears for international research. The mandatory capitalization requirement increased our cash tax liabilities but\nalso decreased our effective tax rate due to increasing the foreign-derived intangible income deduction. The cash\nflow impact may decrease over time as capitalized research and development expenditures continue to amortize.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in August 2022. The act included tax provisions for a 15% corporate\nbook income minimum tax effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2022. We do not expect the Inflation\nReduction Act to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n94\nTable of Contents\n12.

Subsequent Events\nOn February 7, 2023, we announced a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) intended to reduce operating costs and continue\nadvancing our ongoing commitment to profitable growth. The Plan includes a reduction of our current workforce by\napproximately 15%. Decisions regarding the elimination of positions are subject to local law and consultation\nrequirements in certain countries, as well as our business needs.\nWe estimate that we will incur approximately $ 50million to $ 68million in charges in connection with the Plan,\nwhich will be substantially incurred in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. These charges primarily relate to\nemployee transition, severance payments, employee benefits, and stock-based compensation. Of the aggregate amount\nof charges that we estimate we will incur in connection with the Plan, we expect that approximately $ 43million to\n$ 59million will be in future cash expenditures.\n95\nTable of Contents\nThe actions associated with the employee restructuring under the Plan are expected to be substantially complete by\nthe first quarter of fiscal year 2024, subject to local law and consultation requirements.\nThe estimates of the charges and expenditures that we expect to incur in connection with the Plan, and the timing\nthereof, are subject to a number of assumptions, including local law requirements in various jurisdictions, and\nactual amounts may differ materially from estimates. In addition, we may incur other charges or cash expenditures\nnot currently contemplated due to unanticipated events that may occur, including in connection with the\nimplementation of the Plan.",

          "content": "Item 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has\nevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)\nunder the Exchange Act), as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on such\nevaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that as of such date,\nour disclosure controls and procedures were effective at a reasonable assurance level.\nManagement's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting\n(as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of\nthe Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on criteria established in Internal Control –\nIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nManagement has concluded that its internal control over financial reporting was effective as of January 31, 2023 to\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 31, 2023 has been audited by KPMG\nLLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report, which is included in Item 8 of\nthis Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has been no change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(d) and\n15d-15(d) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended January 31, 2023 that has materially\naffected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, does not expect that our\ndisclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all\nfraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute,\nassurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect\nthe fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their\ncosts. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute\nassurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations\ninclude the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a\nsimple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by\ncollusion of two or more people or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls is\nalso based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance\nthat any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time,\ncontrols may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with policies or\nprocedures may deteriorate. Due to inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to\nerror or fraud may occur and not be detected.",
